"Family Holiday","We stayed here for four nights as we had a wonderful stay last year so felt the need to return. The hotel is a little tired now but was still a wonderful stay. The service was great through out although the butler was shared across more than one floor so a little hard to track down sometimes. The white pillows on the sun loungers make it so easy to just relax while viewing the ocean.","5","2024-08"
"Love this place, always have, always will !","Returned to BAA after a break of several years - we had children and it’s not really a young children kind of place in my opinion. The place is almost as it was pre kids, a fantastic experience. 
So what’s changed ? There is no longer a personal connection with the staff who don’t remember your name and treat you as if they have just met you. There have been reductions in the number and size of toiletries etc and finally the technology in the room is very dated and badly needs upgrading - I could watch a rugby match on my phone but not in the room! 
Still love the place and plan to return again this year.  ","5","2024-02"

"Dubai at its best","This was a very memorable experience
They made us feel at home. We were not demanding and they still went out of their way to go above and beyond to give us a great experience. The beach club and water park are a must.
They all knew who we were when we gave room number. No lines and very courteous .
My o lay complaint is I did t stay longer","5","2024-09"

"Hotel fabulous, service good but not amazing, beach club awful","A stay here was always on our bucket list so we decided to go for our first wedding anniversary.
We arranged the hotel transfer which worked seamlessly.
We went to SAL for some lunch prior to our room being ready which was pleasant. 
Our room was pretty wow, and was nice and clean. 
The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. 
We went for dinner in the 2 michelin star seafood restaurant with wine pairing and it was fantastic.  
Breakfast was quite the spread - not sure we did it justice. 
We had spa treatments the following day which were lovely. 

A few negatives, our fridge hadn't been switched on in the room.  We got a cake and some fruit which we'd put in there but it went bad as wasn't chilled.  We noticed the smell the next day.  The butlers were there at the start but we didn't really have much interaction with them.  I'd have expected they would switch the fridge on before we arrived to avoid a funky smell. 

We booked under a half board deal however the details of this and the fact that the restuarants should have given us the information about what was included and what wasn't - that didn't happen. So the lunch part of the half board was wasted on a few small plates. 

Service at SAL was atrocious.  I'm not sure we'd ever go back there.  We got chased back to the hotel like thieves after signing for our bill which was still open as there must have been a staff training issue and they didn't see it.  
We cancelled a future reservation with them and had to follow up on that as the customer relations hadn't got back to us in a day and a half. 

Checkout wasn't a brilliant experience due to the misunderstanding about half board and the bill however a day later we did get a small refund to acknowledge that. 

Overall we are glad we went but a few things soured the experience.  I would go back to eat at the main hotel restarurant or to take friends but I'm not sure I'd go to stay at the hotel,  to the beach club or SAL again.","4","2024-08"
"Amazing.","It is worth every penny. I strongly recommend this hotel (home). We really felt that we are home. They brought flowers and specialty drinks when they found out that I was not feeling well. ","5","2024-08"
"A life experience","Everyone knows the Burj Al Arab. I would say that everyone needs to experience it. It was epic, please book it","5","2024-08"
"Wonderful stay!","From the moment we arrived at Burj Al Arab, we were greeted by Anaëlle, assistant guest relations manager, who could not have been more welcoming. Knowing that we arrived to the hotel after a long flight, Anaëlle swiftly escorted us to our suite where she conducted the check in process without having us stand around in the lobby. Later, she offered to provide a full property tour, detailing the services and amenities offered at Burj Al Arab — everything from the F&B outlets to the various features of the spa. Throughout our stay, during her days off, Anaëlle was consistently helpful and acted as if she was on property the whole time! She was able to assist with off-property dining reservations without referring me to the concierge, clearly ensuring that she was our point of contact throughout our stay.
Anaëlle truly provides personalized service from the heart and acts as an extraordinary ambassador of Burj Al Arab with a smile at all times. I cannot wait to return to this magnificent property! Thank you, Anaëlle!","5","2024-08"
"Character, Charm, and Cheer","What struck me most about this hotel was its unique character. Unlike cookie-cutter chains, this place had personality in spades. The decor was a feast for the eyes, blending local artistry with modern aesthetics. The staff were genuine and friendly, always ready with a local tip or a warm smile. I particularly loved the rooftop bar - the perfect spot to unwind and soak in the city views. A truly memorable stay!","5","2024-07"
"OLD - built in 1999 and never refurbished","Property was built in 1999 and it has never been refurbished since then. The maintenance is a disaster with chipped material, worned fabrics and even rusted pool. The staff has been massively reduced in number compared to what used to be 15 years ago. I went 15 years ago and the hotel in its own style provided a unique and memorable experience. Few days ago I went for one day staycation as my family and I were in Dubai during a super hot August to have one special day. We left extremely disappointed: by a surprisingly old and not taken care of place. We love Dubai and this hotel is one of the flagships of this spectacular city. Can’t be managed like this. If you want great hotels in Jumeirah, don’t worry…. The Mandarin Oriental and the Four Seasons just to mention two of them are really excellent","1","2024-08"
"Out of the world experience of world class hospitality and service","This iconic property is a must experience for connoisseurs of luxury .

"Burj Al Arab…AMAZING!","For a surprise to our daughters we booked a stay at the Burj Al Arab. From the moment we entered we were met with a warm reception and hospitality which matched no other hotel. 

We were showed to our amazing room - 2 bedroom suite - which was exceptionally large and was clean and immaculate.  We met our floor butler Islam who made our stay extra special for the girls and no request was too big! 

Dinner was at Al Mahara where we were seated next to the Aquarium. The Italian seafood cuisine was exceptional and hit its 2 Michelin star rating. Dinner service was a show as we were delighted with each dish that came out and the recommendations made by our waiter were amazing along with the rest of the front of house staff.

We had drinks in the Sky bar on the 27 floor which rounded off the evening.  Staff were attentive and views spectacular. 

SAL, the pool area was peaceful with a breathtaking view of the sea and an infinity pool. All the staff were attentive and the sun loungers and cabanas were plentiful. 

Looking forward to staying again…!","5","2024-08"
"Warmth.","Mohamedn Aadil on the ground floor and reception area was so good and welcoming me and my whole family appreciate the warmth and the processional way he treated us and engaged us and other guests. My brothers and Dad would always come to the ground floor to engage him and have coffee or tea.","5","2024-08"
"Nothing","The staff at the pool were unprofessional, and the service was very slow. I had to remind them more than three times about my drink order. Compared to other hotels, I would rate this experience as zero.","1","2024-08"

"My experience with burj al arab","I have few notes to highlight regarding my one night stay in a 7 star hotel:
- when I made the reservation the call center representative who did the booking for me was very kind and offered me an early check-in between 1 to 2 PM But day before I arrived to the hotel, one lady called me to inform me that the check in time will be strictly 4 PM and it was not a good start with burj alarab. I am for the person in the hotel who did the check in for us about this incident and he made an upgrade for us to a higher floor room 
-The cutlery and cups in the hotel are much depreciated. They need to be up to the standard of a seven star hotel. I noticed this in the room and restaurants as well
-most of the staff were very kind to us except few of them specially on the tour of Burj AlArab section they need to be replaced or trained more. We were very excited to go for the tour, but because of the treatment we have changed our mind. Some of the staff telling us that the tour is a free since you are staying in the hotel and some says that we have to buy so we were very confused I canceled our plan. 
-we were not fully informed about what complimentary with the room, such as wild wadi access, or the tour. We have to explore and ask everything
- I also been charged twice for an order I made in breakfast for 160 AED !!
- I suggest to relook to the overall experience of the customers and to upgrade the hotel standards up to the 7 star hotel 
-also the TV need to be upgraded to a smart version such as othe 3, 4 and 5 star hotels ","3","2024-08"
"I had planned to celebrate my husband’s birthday at Burj Al Arab but got disappointed","Dear Buj Al Arab Hotel Management,

I am writing to express my profound disappointment with our recent stay at your hotel. We chose Buj Al Arab to celebrate my husband's birthday, expecting a special and memorable experience, but unfortunately, our stay was far from satisfactory.

Firstly, when we ordered room service, we were horrified to find a hair in our food. This is an unacceptable lapse in hygiene and quality control.

Secondly, my self image0.jpegimage1.jpeg image2.jpegKeyuri Kachalia, was locked in the bathroom due to a broken door handle. This was not only inconvenient but also quite distressing.

After this incident, we were moved to another room, but the issues persisted. The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in the new room was broken, which meant we did not receive the privacy or service we required.

These incidents collectively made our stay extremely unpleasant and did not reflect the high standards your hotel is known for. We are highly disappointed with the service and the overall experience, especially since we were celebrating a special occasion.

I hope you take these concerns seriously and take appropriate measures to ensure no other guests have to face such issues. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Keyuri Kachalia ","1","2024-07"
"Special 50th Birthday at a Special hotel.","My son and I had the most amazing magical time at this beautiful hotel, the staff, the service and the ambiance of the hotel is unbelievable. The suites are so beautiful and the food is a culinary delight. We spent two nights here to celebrate my 50th, never been so spoilt and made to feel so welcome. My son and I can’t wait for our next stay here. Special mention to Fraser at breakfast and Kate our butler who are both a credit to the hotel.","5","2024-07"
"Something special","Boy was it hot.. off course we knew that upfront so we looked for cool places to stay during the day. The help from the e-concierge was outstanding and the level off all services was of the highest standard. From buggy service to the jumeirah hotels and restaurants across the hotel, the free entrance to wild wadi waterpark etc. As you would expect when going to this hotel but they truly lived up to their reputation. 
Really a great experience and nice to cool off at Sal beach club with great attentive staf again. If you want to get pampered there will be no better place. And don’t let the bling hold you back, it’s not just the place for the extremely rich and famous or the wannabe influencers who don’t want to work for it. It’s also very much for families who want to create lifelong memories.
That’s what we did, thank you for that team Burj al Arab.
Another great addition to our luxury hotel experiences.","5","2024-07"
"Talise Burj Al Arab- Spa day Sister birthday trip to Dubai","The Talise Spa at Burj Al Arab is truly an extraordinary experience. From the moment you walk in, the architectural aesthetics of the hotel are breathtaking. It's best to arrive early to fully enjoy everything the spa has to offer. We had lunch before our treatments, and the food was exceptional. The staff was incredibly accommodating; we requested cucumber lemonade, which wasn't on the menu, but they made it for us anyway. They also prepared a birthday cake for my sister's 40th birthday. The massages were among the best I've ever had, starting with a milk foot wash and scrub, followed by their signature massage. The staff was extremely professional and friendly, providing top-notch customer service. I highly recommend making this a part of your Dubai trip.","5","2024-07"

"Perfect stay experience","Overall, I am very satisfied with the accommodation. The check-in service is good. There is not much waiting time. There are also coffee and snacks to try. The front desk staff personally brought to the room to introduce the facilities, the equipment and supplies on the two floors, and the introduction of the floor butler. The breakfast is rich and selective. Yes, the caramel French toast is delicious. The staff are friendly and helpful. It’s worth visiting again.","5","2024-07"

"Luxury and Elegance - it never gets old!","Arriving from the airport you are travel west on the E11 you see the top of what looks like a sail?  The closer your get the larger the sail becomes.  As you travel the bridge from mainland to island you realize you arrived at someplace special.  Dubai’s iconic Jumeriah Burj Al Arab.  Pure Luxury awaits.  You know this visit is going to be incredible.

Greeted at the entrance by the valet staff you are whisked away into the beautiful lobby.  The sounds of water greet your senses.  The playful arc of the stair fountains grasps your eyes and beckon you to the shear beauty of the lobby.  The colors, oh the colors.  The lobby is a visual kaleidoscope of every color imaginable.  Look up and gaze in awe of the open atrium of this grand hotel.  Venture up the escalator and take in the vast interior of the hotel.  The hotel is visually stunning.

Escorted to our Panoramic One-Bedroom Suite.  Two floors of solid glass await your gaze to the breathtaking landscape of Dubai.  As your eyes shift west across the Arabian Sea you see Palm Island and the Skyline of Dubai Media City and Dubai Marina.  Every aspect of the room radiates luxury.  Spacious does not begin to comprehend the vastness of the suite.  The beds were extremely comfy and provided restful night’s sleep.   Greeted at the door by Cynthia our Butler.  She attended to every detail to enhance our experience.  Cynthia’s customer service must be ingrained in her DNA.  Cynthia was exceptional.

We had the opportunity to meet Varaul Bhatia, Front Desk Manager.  Friendly, outgoing, and outstanding customer service.  

Bab Al Yam is the international breakfast buffet.  Sitting outside overlooking the blue waters of the Arabian Sea and the skylines of Dubai, Amazing!  Ignacio greeted our table every morning.  Asking what can he do to improve our stay?  Absolutely exceptional customer service.  Thank you.

We did not dine at the Burj Al Arab.  I’m sorry I cannot comment on the restaurants.  We did share a bottle of champagne at the Skyview Lounge.  Breathtaking view from the top of the Burj Al Arab.  We also visited the cocktail lounge, Gilt.  The drinks were phenomenal, the motif was a dazzling, ornate vibe.

Our stay at Burj Al Arab is a lifetime worthy, memorable adventure.  Truly a unique experience.  Make the Burj Al Arab your Dubai destination.  You won’t regret it.  The hotel, the view and especially the staff created an unforgettable stop on our journey.  We all had a fabulous time.  Thank you, Judy & Ron, Evie & Frank.","5","2024-05"

"Thanks For Nothing","We decided for our honeymoon to book 4 nights at the Burj Al Arab ( as a supposed luxurious treat )  as part of our 14 night honeymoon.
We arrived at The Burj reception to check in having been in touch several times before we got here to ask for an early check in. It was 09.00 and were greeted by no one … yes no one .. we stood and waited in the lobby for a bit looking rather lost, until a gentleman came over to escort us to a sofa , ( which we could have done ourselves anyway.)
His first comment was to ask for our passports, before he brought cold towels, dates and Arabic coffee were offered but so far not overly impressive. If this is 7 start luxury, I’ll stick with 5 star !! No water or fruit juice offered which you great at any 5 star hotel.
A guest relations manager came to tell us our room category wasn’t ready and whilst would were on a priority waiting list,  the room most likely wouldn’t be ready until 12pm urghhhh priority indeed.
I was starting to wish we hasn’t booked The Burj and would have much rather cancelled and moved straight to the One And Only hotel where you are ALWAYS  treated like a VIP, but no refund was on offer.
I asked to speak to the hotel duty manager in the hope that they may be able to help, but was presented to the Front Desk Manager Mr Bhatia as there wasn’t a duty manager in the hotel. 
He was even less helpful than the guest services individual and just went on to re -confirm  that we couldn’t have a room until around 12pm. He also confirmed that each suite in the Burj takes 3 hours to clean and prepare, which seems an awful lot of cleaning and prep. He did offer us complementary breakfast which we declined as all we wanted was to sleep and unpack. 
I asked Mr Bhatia how busy the hotel was the previous night, and was told he couldn’t discuss this with me as it was private information. Now I know the hotel ‘official’ check in is 3pm but I’ve stayed in Dubai 94 times in the past, and I may have been lucky but I have never had to wait for my room more than 40 minutes to an hour at similar check in times. Memo to self ‘ I’m done with the Burj and won’t be staying here again ‘  Maybe I’ve just been lucky, but it looks like my luck just ran out at The Burj
When I asked Mr Bahria how many times I have stayed here previously ( as I have quite a few times a few years ago when guests were treated like VIP’s )  he had no idea and hadn’t done any  checking on my Jumeirah profile before coming to speak to me. I knew I was fighting a losing battle and if Mr Bahri said “ I understand” once during our conversation, he said it 30 times  which made it even more irritating as he wasn’t able to do anything. It was as if we’d had booked a 3 star travel lodge when we found ourselves having to unpack our suitcases in a public open lobby to find clothes tom wear at the poolside. Never again.  
I was so so frustrated I asked to arrange a meeting with the hotel General Manager……. Mr Beretta, to discuss our feelings, and to explain why we were feeling let down,  but I was told he was unavailable as he is China on business. So I asked to speak to the Hotel Duty Manager, but was told there wasn’t anyone more senior than Mr Bahri in the hotel to speak to. He went to arrange a meeting with the front office manager Ms Nura but guess what she didn’t want to come outside to meet me as it was too hot for her  ! This to deal with issues we had discussed with Mr Bahri, regarding the replenishment of toiletries in the room. So that hasn’t been dealt with either. 
He then told  me that a Ms Cravotto was next in line in the senior management team and that he would arrange a meeting with her for me, but. At 12pm  when he came to drop off our room key outside wherever we were sitting, I was told she is too busy to meet with us at any time over the next 4 days ….. yes 4 days  when were here, so The Burj Al Arab management simply don’t want to speak to those paying their bills face to face. 
There is an air of total arrogance in this hotel which exudes from all of the staff and even of more concern to the guests from the mid to senior management. I have now given up and will wait to move on to the One And Only Royal Mirage Residence after my stay here where I know we will  be treated with value, integrity and appreciation. Here we feel like we’re simply a name and a money making  cog in a huge wheel.
Burj Al Arab management and Directors please read this review and listen to your customers. Try to make time to face your guests good and bad, and please realise we do all have choices","1",

The building, the food, the amenities, and the view are all amazing! However, what made our stay so pleasurable were the hotel staff there.  Starting from the moment we walked in, till the moment we left the hotel, we felt truly cared and treated with warmth and courteousy.

I really liked it!","5","2024-04"
"What an experience.   Amazing....","Friends took us a few years ago for the afternoon tea, which was amazing and we made it our aim to have at least a night in this amazing hotel.

On our recent trip to Duabi we treated ourselves to a night at Burj Al Arab.     Upon arrival the staff could not do enough for us.   Cold towels and they apologised for a lack of welcome drinks as it was Ramadan and the reception is classed as a public area.   No problem at all.      

They told us our room was ready at 11am but then started to give us a few 'funny looks'.    We had arrived a day late!!!     Totally my fault.      The reception staff worked really hard to sort this out and they agreed to give us a room  for the night.   We were so relieved as we had alreay paid.    The staff also seemed genuinely happy for us.    Amazing team at reception.

The hotel itself is out of this world in terms of decor, views and oppolence.    It's all gold, reds and deep blues.      We had a standard suite which was huge.    Over 2 floors.   Massive bed, separate down stairs lounge, Hermes toiletries including full sizes of Hermes aftershave and perfume.     Canapes and drinks delivered to your room between 5 and 7.

We used the Beach Club at Al Naseem - Summersalt.    Really nice with buggys to take you there and back.

The pools at the Burj itself consist of a big familly pool and they were letting older kids use the hot tubs and infinity pool.    I think this was mainly becasue the hotel was quiet.    It was my birthday and they surpised me with an amazing meringue style cream cake!    Really, really nice.

We had pre dinner drinks at the Sky view bar.    Really nice staff and very good cocktails.     The bar is around 40 floors up and has amazing views.   We are used to views being a bit hazy/dusty in Dubai, but in early April it was amazingly clear, with view of Burj Khalifa and the new Atlantis hotel.

We only had one night here and the weather was hot but cloudy.     Not many people were using the pools and the whole Jumierah complex seemed very quiet.    This did mean that there wasn't much atmosphere and all of the outdoor designer beach shops were closed as was the large lobby restuarant.

Bucket list ticked off.    Stunning hotel and amazing staff.","5","2024-04"
"High quality comfort","The hotel is luxury, service is excellent. You get all you need and want. You don´t need to leave the hotel´s territory. There are a very comfortable beach, nice SPA, beautiful swimming pool. You can have a good room service and enjoy your stay in the room with amazing view. ","5","2024-04"
"7 star hotel?","you’d think the service will be impeccable as the hotel is known to be a “7-star” hotel but the service was nothing out of ordinary.  If anything, we have received better service at the other 5 star hotels. we had to wait an hour for a room despite the hotel calling us the day before check in to ask our estimated arrival at the hotel. Upon booking, we had also stated that we are celebrating our first wedding anniversary expecting they will provide a simple gesture that will make our stay special (like how other hotels provide cakes or etc) but upon entering the room, there was nothing. We had to call the reception again to inform them about it. The butler service is good, but it was a bit slow (getting the hotel bill / luggage assistance took 30 minutes). 

The breakfast restaurant though is great. The staff, Diyor is very helpful and accommodating. 

The room has an amazing view, but the service? Mid.","3","2024-04"
"Second visit maybe the last!","This was our second stay at the Burj.

I would just like to say a special thank you to all of the breakfast staff for amazing and wonderful service . This was the best part of our stay. The service was impeccable. Also a huge thank you to Chef who created some wonderful vegan breakfast options for us. Amazing! The breakfast team were outstanding!

Also I would like to thank our Butler Gucci was was very kind and arranged a birthday in room surprise for our daughter.
Also thank you to Angelica.

We had a  couples massage which was one of the best massages I’ve had in a long time. However the spa itself was dated and unimpressive.

The  vegan options by the pool side were basically non existent.
I don’t mind but as a hotel of this standing I would expect at least one option that wasn’t a fruit platter or a salad. 

The  quality of room service food especially for the children was very basic . The pasta was awful no flavour at all. 

Also when we had booked for afternoon tea they told us it wasn’t possible to offer vegan! I find  this unacceptable as a paying guest and who have paid a lot of money for a weeks stay. It was confusing because they would leave Vegan canapés and sandwiches in our room daily. 
The tea manager did agree to make us vegan sandwiches but no pastries and cakes. The tea overall was underwhelming.

I do not feel that the staff are trained to go over and above for the guests needs. I would prefer less fancy gifts offered and more towards keeping the guests happy.

Lastly we had a 2:45 am flight so were due to depart very late so requested if we may use some facilities to take a shower but were refused. We were just told the spa was closed. This is an example of not going over and above for guests.

I do not think I would return again. I do love the room ( mainly the size) and the hotel location however there are better hotels. We usually stay at the Mandarin Oriental Emirates Palace which I find far superior .","4","2024-04"

"World’s best hotel - Wonderful Stay","Our favourite hotel in Dubai and the world. Burj Al Arab truly is the world’s only 7 star hotel. We stayed for a few nights in April this year and had a wonderful stay. 

Our butlers Gucci and Maryam were so helpful and could not do enough for us. The hotel was also very helpful over e-butler before we arrived and during our stay. 

The pool area is world class with amazing service and facilities. The wrap around infinity pool was stunning. If you can’t afford to stay at the hotel it is definitely still worth visiting to use the pool area. 

Breakfast was also fantastic each day with a large selection of food and you also can order from the al a carte menu which feels like a more premium experience in line with the hotel. 

Finally our hotel suite was amazing. So large compared to any other hotel room. We stayed in the 2 bedroom family suite. As a family of 5 this was a perfect room for us with so much space. 

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning in the near future.","5","2024-04"

"UMA Lounge - Huge Tourist Trap","This review is not about the whole hotel but just the UMA Lounge. We were staying at St. Regis Palm but my family wanted to visit the iconic Burj Al Arab. I found a following option on their website: UMA Premium Cabana Reservation for 1,500dirhams (around USD400), maximum capacity 6persons. The amount was redeemable credit to be used. 

The UMA Lounge is a gigantic tourist trap. The menu is a total disaster, not even an attempt to offer something more sophisticated besides Club Sandwich and Pizza Margherita. I am more than happy to pay premium for something special but $40 for a hot chocolate that didnt look or taste anything special?  

Stay away from this place, there are hundreds of better places to visit in Dubai.","1","2024-03"
"Outstandingly Amazing","Outstanding in every aspect of the word! 7-stars well earned actually closer to infinity stars of if I had my way.. location, hospitality, suites, comfort, amenities, not one miss or less then outstanding..

"Unfortunately, the legend has plummeted into complete decline!","Unfortunately, the legend has plummeted into complete decline! The Burj al Arab hotel is unlikely to ever regain its former glory! I will share my experience and caution others not to spend their money here. Instead, you will only receive complete disappointment, if not outright insult! I first stayed at this hotel in 2014 and have often returned, inviting my guests as well. My friends and elder brothers lived here long-term from 2015 to 2018. And now, I have experienced firsthand why they no longer live here and don't recommend it to their friends and guests!

I made a reservation for the period from March 3 to March 8, 2024, for 5 days. I booked over the phone, paying the full amount with my personal card for my dear friend, without any discounts. The reservation over the phone was correct, the money was deducted without any issues. But then the chaos began, unparalleled even with 4-star hotels!!!

Upon entering the room, we immediately went down to the poolside restaurant for a snack. Particularly noteworthy is that no one escorted us, and there was no butler on the floor, as we were accustomed to before. The carpets throughout the hotel were dirty, the hotel was empty, and it looked abandoned.

Approaching the entrance to the restaurant, we were not greeted by an aggressive hostess. Passing by the unfriendly girl, we heard ourselves being rudely called. Surprised, we stopped and turned around, and she asked if we had a reservation. Informing her that we were hotel guests and wanted to eat, she, without leaving her place, rudely asked if we had a reservation (the restaurant was half empty), and there was a distance between us, forcing her to shout at us. We waited for her to understand that she needed to come over herself, she sternly grabbed her tablet from the charger, approached us, asked for the room number, and grumbled that we could go now. Amazed by such hospitality, we went to the table, noting with my friend that such behavior was simply unacceptable before. In the restaurant itself, the waiter knew the menu, recommended dishes, no complaints. However, the menu was very ordinary, and my friend, being on a diet, couldn't order anything dietetic.

While waiting for my guest's spouse to arrive, we went up to the room. This time the butler was in his place, but we noted among ourselves that he didn't bother to open the door, just greeted us. We asked if we could get a box of dates, as it was always placed in the room upon check-in. The butler only said he would try to come up with something. After spending about an hour in the room, we left to go to the airport to meet my friend's wife. We asked the same butler about the dates, to which he replied that there would be no dates, laughed loudly for no reason at us, added that he asked the manager about it, but he refused. The butler shook his head, complained about the manager, and said (attention) that the manager, a Chinese man, didn't understand anything about service. We were stunned by such an attitude.

In the sauna and spa, things were not as they used to be, to say the least. Nobody greeted us, although there were 3 people at the reception. They were busy with their own affairs, barely noticing us. We threw our room number over our shoulder, but they weren't interested. Inside, a cheerful cleaner, quite the master of the house, said he had been there for a long time and recognized us. We complained to him that the hotel service had fallen to zero, with which he agreed, constantly laughing. We were told that the spa closes at 9:00 pm, but at 8:00 pm a security guard approached, saying that everything was closing and we needed to leave.
The climax was a message in the messenger, which was sent to my phone, indicating the name of my ex-girlfriend! This shook me up, and I began to complain to the manager, how is this possible? My profile has existed for 10 years, I paid with my card, and here's a woman's name. Asking the manager, I decided that at least on the last day they would listen to me. After stating all the complaints, I asked him to meet us upon checkout. Philip listened to us again, but indifferently, only offering apologies. My friend and I argued that Philip, the manager, wouldn't restore the service either, and my friend won. Varaul came out to us 20 minutes late with a box. He himself was unshaven and unkempt (before, everyone, not just managers, looked sharp), repeating routine phrases and apologies, this manager handed us a box of something cheap (scented candles, which he might have been looking for all this time). Explaining to him that we regretted spending our money and would never return, he just shrugged.

On the way to the airport, my friend asked to call back and ask for a one-time entry to the sauna for me. I suspected that these demotivated guys wouldn't do it, and we started calling. Manager Varaul said that you have to pay for the spa and didn't even try to accommodate us in the end.
Perhaps it's our own fault, accustomed to first-class service for which we paid in full, but this time we only received ridicule.

By the way, every night they clean something there, and you have to bypass the fenced lobby.
One evening in the Sahn Eddar Lounge, sitting down to talk on the phone, I saw 3 guys behind the counter who didn't approach me. I waved my hand, a nervous lady approached, saying they were closed, but they would give me some water anyway. Is it nothing that I sat and waited for you for 10 minutes, and you approached exactly at closing time to tell me about it?!","1","2024-02"
"Unparalleled Luxury and Hospitality: A Dreamy Stay at the Burj Al Arab Hotel Dubai","The Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai exceeded all my expectations! From the moment I arrived, I was treated like royalty. The stunning architecture, luxurious amenities, and impeccable service truly made my stay unforgettable.

"Opulence at its best","An experience unlike any other.  Rooms are huge and can fit 4-5 people comfortably.  Service is exquisite- every little detail taken care of with the floor butler being super attentive.  Breakfast was fantastic, Peter at the restaurant would bring us Indian dishes that were off menu.  The views are incredible- only complaint is you cannot go to the rooftop restaurant after 1pm if you just want to see the view.","5","2024-02"

"Amazing experience","The hotel and staff did not disappoint. From the greeting and sit down check in to the escort to our suite with an explanation of everything including what we should try snd where we should eat. 
Butler was at our door opening it as soon as we stepped off the elevator. Never had to use our key. Also came and ran our jacuzzi for us in the evening. The suite we had (two floors) was over the top in opulence, clean, great ocean views, fantastic bed and full size Hermes amenities. 
The pool area is wonderful with amazing service and also the spa which we were given a tour and offered a two for one to experience for the Mind Spa. Went the next morning to the spa and the Mind Spa wasn’t working so they gave us complimentary 1/2 hour massages while we waited.  Great way to start the day and end our stay.
We had an early dinner at Sal patio which gives a perfect view of the sun setting over the ocean. 
Breakfast was a bit disappointing as I was expecting more variety.
While the hotel and everything in it is pricey I would definitely say you have to go at least once for the experience which was over the top and leaving me wanting to return.","5","2024-01"
"The service was really bad.","The service was really bad. Never knew the butler of my floor during my whole stay. The restaurant  for breakfast is small for the quantity of guests and the food was not good.

"Unforgettable Sundowner Experience at SAL, Burj Al Arab","My visit to SAL at the Burj Al Arab was an experience that epitomized luxury and relaxation in every sense. Known as a prime sundowner destination in Dubai, SAL exceeded my expectations, offering not just stunning views but an ambiance that's truly unparalleled.

Nestled against the backdrop of the iconic Burj Al Arab, SAL presents an awe-inspiring view of the sea that captivates from the moment you arrive. As the sun dips below the horizon, the sky transforms into a canvas of vibrant hues, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that's beautifully complemented by the silhouette of the Burj Al Arab. It's a sight that embodies the essence of Dubai's luxury lifestyle.

The drinks menu at SAL is thoughtfully curated, featuring a variety of refreshing cocktails and other beverages that are perfect for savoring as you soak in the breathtaking views. Each drink is crafted to perfection, promising a delightful accompaniment to the unfolding sunset.

Adding to the experience, SAL offers an excellent selection of sheesha, with flavors that cater to all preferences. Enjoying sheesha here, with the gentle sea breeze and the Burj Al Arab in the background, elevates the experience to something truly special.

For those feeling peckish, SAL serves up a range of light snacks that are as delightful in taste as they are in presentation. While the offerings may be light, they are perfectly suited to complement the drinks and sheesha, ensuring a satisfying culinary experience without overpowering the senses.

The ambiance at SAL is wonderfully breezy, thanks to its open-air setting by the sea. The gentle ocean breeze adds a natural, refreshing touch to the experience, making it all the more enjoyable. It's an ideal spot for those looking to unwind in a luxurious yet relaxed setting.

A friendly tip for future visitors: remember to bring your swimming trunks. SAL's setting by the pool and sea invites you to take a dip and cool off, adding a layer of leisure and fun to your visit.

In conclusion, my visit to SAL at the Burj Al Arab was nothing short of magical. With its exceptional combination of stunning views, great drinks and sheesha, light snacks, and a breezy ambiance, it stands out as a must-visit sundowner destination in Dubai. Whether you're looking to relax with friends or enjoy a romantic evening with a loved one, SAL promises an experience that's both memorable and luxurious.","5","2024-02"

"Urn al Arab - an opportunity lost","An interestingly decorated hotel that fails to live up to its 7 star claims. The service is alternately obsequious and/or snooty. At no time do you receive good service beyond that written in their staff manuals. Due to the provision of tours of the hotel to outside people the hotel is obsessed with security and tracking whether you are a guest or a random. Overall it is a busy place with little to recommend the ridiculous prices. Other hotels in the Dubai area provide superior experiences at a fraction of the cost. My recommendation to the hotel is to go to those other options and learn from them.","4","2024-02"

"When is a 7-Star not a 7-Star? Broken Promises at Burj Al Arab","UPDATE:

Here is the backstory: I had hoped to write a positive review, but unfortunately, I was unable to do so.

I previously posted a review of my experience at the Burj Al Arab and shortly after posting my review, I received a prompt reply from the general manager, Tristan, via TripAdvisor. We exchanged several messages, in which I offered detailed feedback about my experience. Tristan asked to speak to me on the phone and we had an hour-long call and further discussion, he deeply appreciated my input and was excited to inform me that the hotel already had plans to revamp its restaurants and menus.

In lieu of my comprehensive feedback and previous less than positive experience at the hotel, Mr. Tristan wanted to welcome me back to Burj Al Arab for a complimentary breakfast/afternoon tea and personally give me a tour to showcase the improvements they've made. Although I couldn't specify when I would return, he insisted the invitation remained open for whenever I next visited Dubai.

A few years later...
So I recently contacted the hotel as I had planned to visit Dubai and was eager to experience Tristan's kind offer of a complimentary breakfast/afternoon tea and tour of the revamped hotel. 

However...
I was promptly told, without any explanation, that they wouldn't honour the offer and that Mr. Tristan was no longer the manager. On pressing for a reason, I was told that any offer would expire after a year. I sent them all the email and correspondence to demonstrate that I was not offered a voucher as such and that Mr. Tristan never mentioned an expiration date.

They refused to budge and further complicated their stance by saying that, even if they could, they couldn't honour the offer due to the busy period. Surprisingly, the same email offered me a booking if I paid the full price. This clearly demonstrates that their decision to renege on the offer and goodwill gesture was driven by financial motives.

I am deeply disappointed that a hotel with such a high reputation would stoop so low as to renege on an offer and undo the good work that Mr. Tristan established. In the grand scheme of things, this goodwill gesture would have been insignificant for them but immensely meaningful for me.

My travels have led me to some exceptional establishments in Dubai where the customer service is truly exemplary. Based on my experience with Middle Eastern people and culture, I understand that respect and honesty are core values; one's word is considered their bond.

If a 7-star hotel cannot be trusted to keep its word, then can it truly be considered a 7-star establishment? Reneging on a deal might seem like a small thing, but it reveals a much larger gap between their self-proclaimed luxury and the reality of their business practices. It's simply not ""7-star,"" it's just cheap.","1","2024-01"
"Home away from Home","I am a regular guest at the hotel and have been that way from about 2002 onwards. During COVID my stays there decreased and now I am looking forward to staying there again this month.
It is undoubtedly the best hotel in the world ,I have stayed at many luxury hotels but nothing comes even closer to Burj Al Arab.
It is an experience of a lifetime time, though expensive but the service that is offered covers more than what you pay for.
The rooms are lavish ,the staff unbeatable, the spas like nowhere else and breakfast service to die for.
I always feel welcomed and they treat me like i am coming back home ,I have always been upgraded to beyond the standard one level upgrade, which makes a huge difference and I have enjoyed from standard suite to panoramic suite to club suite to the presidential suite. 
At one of the stays even the GM of the hotel came and visited and thanked for always staying at the Burj while in Dubai, no where does one het service like that but it does help to be a regular guest. So my recommendation if you can stay there as often as you can you will be treated like royalty.
I am looking froward to my stay again at my most favorite hotel.","5","2024-01"

We made a day of it and enjoyed the beautiful views, swimming pool, lunch and service. The music from the DJ and accompanying saxophonist was also really cool. One member of staff who looked after us by the pool and whose service was truly exceptional was that of Robert who hailed from Kenya. His friendly demeanour, professional attitude and excellent service were second-to-none. As a family we were drawn to the exceptional quality of the hotel and we will be making our way back there this time to spend a few days at The Burj Al Arab.  ","5","2023-11"
"I love Burj al Arab","I stay in Burj al Arab for three days during Christmas , really I advice anyone to do the same I love all the activity services there it is unbelievable , the staff are perfect ,professional I am staying there four time during the year every year ","5","2023-12"
"Everything in Dubai is over priced","3 beers cost - US$60. - basic appetizers were US$90 main course pricing was offensive, even at the pool bar area. Make no mistake though, that the service and quality was top notch however the pricing is so far above anything respectable, and it's not twice the fair value but more like 4 to 10 times what it should be, It just wears on you as you are powerless to do anything.  My advice is to stay home, and plan a shopping spree in the tens of thousands and really buy something nice and lasting because you won't really look at your travel pictures with fondness.  You will more likely look at them with regret ad disappointment as to what wonderful items you could have purchased instead.","2","2023-12"
"Home away from home!","We stay here twice a year because we love every second of our stay. We know there a lot of options in Dubai when it comes to accommodations, but nothing beats this property. Skylar is the best place to view Panoramic Dubai. ","5","2023-12"
"One of the most expensive hotels in the world","We were amazed with the architecture of the hotel and the ambiance of the lobby and common areas , we were welcomed and sat at the lobby and a personalized butler made the check in with kindness and education .  When we enter our suite was a brand new experience with a really 5 start + hotel .  Every single detail was outstanding and smell of aisles were fantastic . Having breakfast outside next to Persian Gulf was excellent with service and food . Definitely every penny ($$$$$) spent was worth it ! I will go back again ","5","2023-12"
"TOP HOTEL & SERVICES","This is a really top hotel with excellent services. I've been to good hotels in different parts of the world, but this is great. Exceptional cleanliness everywhere and the staff are very courteous and service ready.  The rooms are spacious and have all the comfort you need. Very harmonious in the interior and they have chosen a nice scent for the interiors. The breakfast is brilliant, catering for all special dietary needs. I loved ❤️","5","2023-12"
"Burj al Arab","The hotel could really do with a revamp as it feels dated but it is still always good to stay at. Staff at pool and breakfast are great and the butler Anup was brilliant, always happy to help, friendly and very personable.","4","2023-12"
"The best hotel in town","Burj Al Arab might not be the flashiest hotel in town any more but it's certainly the best still. The Hotels in Dubai are in General severals levels above the equivalent hotels in Europe but Burje Al Arab is a notch above everyone else in terms of service, room size and experience overall and they take staff training extremely seriously","5","2023-12"
"Burj al Arab","A great experience but if you like something sober this is not the place for you however the sky view bar offers stunning views of Arabian Sea. Food is ok. People are courteous around the dinner included the drinks however the water is expensive to by otherwise","5","2023-10"
"excellent","This was a first visit. The customer service was great. Room service was excellent.
Special thanks - Thyra, Renat, Dilshodbek,Kenan,Lilukbek.

"So far so good experience staying, really worth ??","I stayed for 1 night only on Nov. 25, it was gorgerous & luxuray when entered into the hotel lobby.   Due to the peak season, we need to wait for awhile to allocate the room.
Even room allocate, the luggage is quite late to arrive even called to the services and they answered ""on the way"".

"Holiday vacation","we visited there and it was so amazing every staff was friendly and helpful and especially Mr Shoyadbek was so nice staff he has helped us with all the things 
we made enjoyable holiday weekend at the hotel 
that is greatly experience to uss and we will never forget this time 
Thank you so much ","5","2023-12"
"Expensive, but so worth it! ","We went to the. Sunset bar to enjoy the views and the cocktails. It is expensive, you have to pre-book and pay 200 drm per person for the booking, the drinks are then added to the bill. The views across the Palm and the city are dramatic. It was an amazing experience. ","5","2023-11"
"Perfect","The rooms are just stunning and experience is always nice. Never dissapoints. From picking up with Rolls Royce at the aeroport, from flowers in the car. Little daily attentions. Is my second stay there. ","5","2023-01"
"The best","This is my 4th stay at Burj Al Arab, there are obvious reasons I keep coming back.
I love it here. It might be over 20 years old, but it's still my favourite hotel.
I last stayed in 2019.

I'd requested a slightly early checkin if were at all possible, and this was accommodated by Lucas - an intern who will certainly go far in his hospitality career!

The only reason I've marked it 4 / 5 is there were a couple of minor issues I've not experienced here before. These are minor, but something I wanted to mention.

On my previous stays, checkout has been handled in the room - with someone coming to clear the bill, arrange transport etc.
This stay, however, there was a notable lack of butler presence, and checkout had to be done downstairs in the lobby - which took some time, and left me waiting.

The bath tub didn't fill (or stay full) - there was an issue with the plug.
An engineer did come and was thankfully able to fix this, however.

Similarly, the in-room coffee machine didn't work - again, this was fixed when I let staff know.

Overall, I would have no hesitation on returning again.

Staying at other hotels in Dubai makes you realise just how good this hotel truly is!","4","2023-11"
"heaven sent","What an experience . We felt  totally spoilt . All the surroundings all staff members were at another level. We were met by such friendly staff at the door.  Our  check in was quick our room was magnificent with beautiful views -  not sure this experience can  ever be beaten. ","5","2023-11"

"Excellent hotel in first class","Excellent staff and service. Nice and clean suites, you’re feel welcome in 1 minute when you arrive at the hotel. The breakfast are supreme. Nice surroundings. The hotel is over our expectations. Not a 7-star hotel! 10 stars here from Denmark. We Will defently come back again😊","5","2023-11"
"Skyview Lounge drinks","The Skyview Lounge was a great place for sunset / early evening drinks.  We had champagne and bar snacks which were delicious.  While it is quite pricey, the service was excellent, and the views were stunning in this iconic location for a special event.  ","4","2023-10"
"The best experience"," Everything was fabulous , batker service was really unforgetable,  our stay was amazing, room was really the best experience, we will repeat definitley our family stay at Burj Al Arab. Highly reccomended👌","5","2023-11"
"Amazing Spa services","I didn't stay at the hotel, but I booked the balance massage at their amazing spa located at the 18th floor. FANTASTIC! It was the best massage I ever had, and I've got a fair amount. The service is perfection, the place breathtaking, and the massage OMG! 90 minutes of going to heaven. I wish I remember the name of my massage therapist as she was amazing!!! Totally worth every peny.🤩💆 ","5","2023-11"
"tourist trap","This place is a tourist trap. The website said palm view but they put us on such a low floor that we couldn't see the fronds of the palms. Make sure you pay the stratospheric deposit per person of AED 2000! in AED so they don't take a credit card authorization which can tie up your money for several days after you leave the hotel. The ATM is the hotel doesn't charge bank fees. The rule of not bringing any food into the hotel is designed to make you eat in their outrageously priced restaurants. A good restaurant fairly close is the Odeon market. The breakfast looks exotic but tastes bland. Everything in the hotel is outrageously priced. The staff were great. Having read all 40 pages of terrible reviews the standout was the staff member who told the guest that is was the hotel's policy to try to get the guests to spend more than AED 1500 a night in the hotel.","1","2023-11"
"Unforgettable Experience","We stayed five nights in the hotel. It is impossible to write how good it was. We had great times. From the moment we were greeted at the door to the departure, we felt very special. Thanks to all staff and management.","5","2023-11"
"Singularly the very best travel experience of a lifetime. Nothing comes close","It would not be possible to fully convey the excellence delivered by the hotel and the staff. The Burj Al Arab is known worldwide and recognized as Best in Field. The Staff exceeds any accolade about the property. From the Door personnel, Front Desk, Room Butler and Concierge, there is not anyone who does not bend over backwards to exceed any expectation. Great service isn't delivering a request. Great Service is anticipating every need, and then exceeding it. I cannot wait to go back","5","2023-11"
"Burj Al Arab review from Nov 2023","A hotel you have to stay at least once in a lifetime. Save up some money, enjoy the exrtavagance, and come back for more if you like it. Prepare to be pampered. Get your swimsuits, the pool and poolside experience is worth writing about. And get a great camera. The photos will stay for life.","5","2023-11"
"Amazing","Loved it like as always best place on earth to stay with the best staff and managers and everything that come with the stay thanks you so much guys and looking forward to come back soon to enjoy and have a nice time again","5","2023-11"
"We really have a feeling of VIP","It’s no need to mention the hotel is how grand and luxury because everyone knows that. I just thank the manager of the hotel who had handwritten a letter on the greeting card with decorated red balloons and a sweet chocolate cake to give good wishes for both my wife and me retired lives. It was a big surprising when my wife and daughter and me entered the beautiful suite, just because the manager carefully read in advance the reason that my daughter booked the hotel to celebrate parents retirement. I’d like to say that we really have a feeling of VIP during our stay in the hotel.","5","2023-11"
"Amazing hotel barj Arab","Very nice hotel very amazing surface really really time I will come this hotel so amazing I am interested we come back because it's very very nice hotels very good and the view amazing and hotels surface drink room everything perfect really sure I love with this happens because this is the number one of the world I see very very amazing everything","5","2023-11"
"Seven Star Service at Sal ","We spent a wonderful day in a luxury cabana at the Burj last week.  I took my 13 year old daughter as a treat, whilst on holiday in Dubai.  Booking was easy (I booked a few months prior) and our experience was wonderful.  Sal beachclub is so chilled, the service was exceptional - warm and friendly.  The cabana was a welcome addition in the heat and the food and drink really was outstanding (especially the homemade ice creams and sorbets!).  Not being hotel guests, I was a little apprehensive about how we might be treated.  I need not have worried.  We were treated like royalty.  Service was efficient, professional and unobtrusive.  I would definitely recommend a day here.  It's beautiful, and we will definitely return.  ","5","2023-10"

"Holidays","This  feedback is for new stay in this  hotel during the time 25 august until 5 of September 2023

We reply our feedback little late
We enjoy staying in this amazing hotel every time
The most important is the hotel staff who are respectful , willing and polite,
We would especially like to mention the following
Roma,
Nitesh
Nurba,
Atishan
Sumer who are working in the pool and  Manjet Sinan who served us in our suite
I want to add something more about the rooms need renovation because
when you enter the room it smells  humidity , and in  compare  with the other years  there  were also some shortcomings such as the computer and some other small things but this does not negate the fact that the hotel is super top and we will come again soon , it is the best hotel we go to.
We thank you for your hospitality and we will see you soon","5","2023-09"
"The most dissapointed hotel that I ever stay in my whole life. ","The worst experience in my whole life staying in hotels :(
1) As so as I booked the hotel? They start to CALL ME FROM DUBAI :((( But aparentely they do not know that in the earth planet the hours are different. So, they wake me up at 3:00 AM in the morning here in Montevideo.
2) My big room was at 19 Celscius Degrees when i arrived. Didn't they know that the comphortable temperature is 24 Celcius Degrees? 
3) At the 14 floor, my room have one STAIR INSIDE. What this means? That I need to go up and down starirs, because half of my things are donwstairs, and half of them up stairs. And the worse thing, is that the lack of maintenance of their steps!. The tenth step of my room sounded hollow :(. And it wasn't strong granite. I was the fragile white marble :( Very, very dangerous!
4) My horrible dinner was included. I totally regret went there. They do not have the gentile of put my table close to one window, and the worse part: They charge me for the ONLY TWO THINGS that i took: A glass of champagne and one camomile tea. They do not have any soup in the menue. Incredible.  ","1","2023-10"
"Amazing sight on the beach","This is a 7 star hotel not a tourist attraction but it’s definitely a must see. You can’t get into it unless you’re staying there. We saw it at night lit up purple from the roadside and again during the day from the sea whilst on a boat trip. Either way it’s a majestic sight. The architecture is shaped like a sail and it has a helipad on its roof and is not to be missed!","5","2023-10"
"BurjAlArab from Hospitality Pro","I have experince almost all starline hotels and wanted to check BAABurj Al Arab) duo to check and audit the differnces and service industry, To me it was all familiar and could easily relate how different it can be. The services provided in person was excellent other than a brief stay at arrival, Welcome spalsh was memorable and stay with my 6 year old son was somehting to remember. ","5","2023-10"
"Most luxurious hotel in the World","Most luxurious hotel in the world and the reasons that made it an icon of Dubai were all confirmed in my stay. Ultra modern and luxurious apartment room, Hermes products in the bathroom, Egyptian bed and pillows. Everything is superlative, unparalleled, unique and luxurious in every moment to be experienced. High quality breakfast by the sea. Sal's experience with the Terrace with its infinity seawater pools leads to spending the day in absolute relaxation in a trendy context. Star Michelin dinner at the Olivo underwater restaurant with superlative Italian cuisine immersed in a tropical aquarium. Dedicated check in, professional staff and impeccable management Jumeirah. Stay different in Dubai, 7 star luxury.","5","2022-11"
"Royal service","From the moment we  walked into the lobby , we were treated like a royal family , we were given coffee and dates, the front desk staff led us to our room, all the facilities were explained carefully , the room is clean and cold（ the outside temperature was about 38 Celsius )","5","2023-10"
"A luxurious and wonderful place to renew your wedding vows and enjoy a romantic anniversary!","What a luxurious place to visit.  All of the boxes relating to both the personal touch and the quality space well and truly ticked.  The people are exceptional, the food is sublime and of the highest standard and the building itself is just a home from home but of 7 start standard.  I cannot think of one thing, other than my wife getting the flowers, when there was none for me, too complain about,(for those that take things too literally, that's a joke, I was given them secretly to give to my wife, that's never happened to.me before!)  Stay there before you leave this world. You will want to go back.","5","2023-10"
"High tea with a twist of hostility ","So I booked for afternoon tea for my husband and my wedding anniversary 5 courses it went that slow they forgot about us twice it was like they didn’t trust us to pay the bill the server came over knelt down at side of me and said I basically have to pay otherwise I wasn’t getting any more of my afternoon tea I’d asked for two pots of tea that didn’t arrive it was terrible I felt like a criminal it ruined the whole experience I paid and left didn’t even look around the place I couldn’t wait to get out I did contact the burj but it seems there not interested £250 for a five course afternoon tea I could have gone anywhere in Dubai for that but I won’t return the staff were rude and cold towards guests ","1","2023-10"
"Gold Cappuccino Tour not great","We booked the Gold Cappuccino experience and were very disappointed. Hotel was nice to see, but service is lacking here and therefore we won’t be booking to stay here when we return. Despite paying extra, we were ignored, with blue badge holders getting priority with tables for the drink?! We were left waiting ages for our group to finish (blue badge holders took our table- leaving us without) and not one staff member moved them on.  We couldn’t enjoy our experience, as we had to stand and watch them, despite us paying extra! The experience wasn’t very organised either, with large groups ramming themselves into buggies first despite people who have queued for ages! A real shame, 7 star , but service isn’t sadly. Its a free for all, so not enjoyable.","2","2023-10"
"Exquisite","Best hotel to stay in Dubai
This was just an amazing place to stay either if you come to do business  or pleasure. The breakfast buffet is just to good to not pay for it.
I totally recommend this hotel! We stayed like a week here and never got tired of the food here or the ammenities like the gym, sauna or Pool, view etc.

Thank you. ","5","2023-02"
"Burj Al Arab","Horrible stay. Paid for the best room in the hotel and ended up with the worst room. £12,000 down the drain. I also paid for all inclusive and had to pay for every bit of food i wanted. Also requested a luxury helicopter ride with the missus so i could propose, she said yes. But we ended up with some american couple. Fuming worst stay ever.","1","2023-07"
"As Good as Ever","It remains the iconic hotel in Dubai!! A brief visit to Dubai and whilst not staying on this occasion we opted to enjoy the terrace through the day pass. 

An experience I would recommend to all and we just want to call out the fantastic service that was experienced and on the occasion in particular from Abbas and Nagoor. Lunch at Sal was as ever wonderful and we look forward to returning soon , this time as hotel guests.","5","2023-09"

"Burj Al Arab Tour & Afternoon Tea Experience ","Myself and my wife booked a package at the Burj Al Arab (Tour + Afternoon Tea at Sahn Eddar with Champagne - 839 AED - we also included a signature drink as part of the package at additional cost) 

Our tour started off on a low note, we booked into the reception area at Jumeirah beach and were rounded up like cattle into a corralled area with no offer of any drinks / water. 

After approximately 20 minutes a buggy arrived and the tour begun with an open journey in the 40 degree heat across to the Burj Al Arab where they take your picture at the side of the road with the iconic building in the background (The picture doesn’t come as part of the package it’s an optional extra). 

We then proceeded to a side entrance at the bottom of the Burj Al Arab ( You don’t get taken in the main entrance and are told you can’t take any pictures in the lobby as not to disturb the guests) when entering this area I noticed water coming from an area of the ceiling dripping onto the wet marble floor and I had to point out to another person in our group that it was wet and she could slip, when pointing this out to the guide he said yes they know about it (They should have had signage up or barriers in place to prevent someone from injuring themself). 

The tour then continues up to the top floor where you get a chance to view rooms which have been turned into a museum - this was good. 

On our way back down from the tour we were taken back to the side entrance of the Burj and we’re about to be loaded back onto the buggy for our journey back to Jumeira Beach. 

We told the guide about our afternoon tea and we’re pointed in the direction of the lobby (At this point we were told we could take our lanyards off as we were technically guests for afternoon tea). 

Afternoon tea is now located at Shan Eddar which is essentially in the lobby area of the hotel. Our experience of this was certainly not that expected of a 7 star hotel. The Service was terrible, my wife had stated on the booking form that she is allergic to fish this was completely ignored. 

We informed the waiter of this upon arrival and he then proceeded to bring her Salmon. Very disappointing. Overall the service was slow, the chairs were very worn and the cutlery looked as though it has been used to feed 5000 people all tarnished and chipped. 

Following our afternoon tea experience we asked the waiter if we could have our signature drink (which was paid for as part of our booking). The waiter then advised that we better hurry as it was in a separate bar not inside the hotel, so we then had to rush to get our drink outside the hotel. Again very disappointing. 

We have emailed he hotel to advise of our disappointment but have had no further correspondence. 

We would not recommend this afternoon tea experience, you will have a much better experience at either Taj Exotica Resort and spa or Raffles the Palm. 

You can build a hotel out of gold however it’s the customer experience / Service which makes it truly magical!

"It’s was a great experience to staying here. I am 100% satisfied","The location was a great! It’s was a great experience to staying here. I am 100% satisfied. Lovely view and breakfast was great. Love to be back again to Burj Arab. This stay was very memorable and I had the best experience ever","5","2023-09"
"Afternoon tea to forget","Absolutely stunning hotel, very beautiful all round.
We tried an afternoon tea experience,  the food on offer was very poor and some of it tasteless,  we had to keep on asking for soft drinks and tea, we had 1 coke and 1 cup of tea during our experience,  this is advertised as unlimited. 
Later on my wife became very sick, I informed the hotel, they said it was not down to them and offered me a free tea and pastry next time I was in dubai.
I said I won't be back anytime soon and asked for a refund, the hotel declined my proposal.
I've had better afternoon tea at harrods at a fraction of the cost.
Vastly over rated experience and very over priced.

"Great service and a great stay!!","What an incredible experience.  We stayed here last year and enjoyed our stay, but this past week's stay was over the top!  We celebrated our 24th anniversary and they truly made us feel special.  From the moment we arrived, the tone was set.  First impressions are important and Habib, Anish, Willis, and Acohl were there to open our car door, welcome us to the hotel, and always there with a smile to welcome us back to our room after a long day out.  They really made us smile every time we saw them, because they are always smiling whether to arrange a buggy for us, or simply open the door as we walk in.  Omar, our butler, was very thorough and explained all the details of our room.  He was super nice and sent us treats to our room a couple days later.  At breakfast at Bad al Yam, Pierre-Alexis was phenomenal and paid close attention to details.  He scanned the room and noticed my husband did not have water and rushed to get him some, but it was not an error, my husband had already been offered water and turned it down.  Clara worked along side with Pierre-Alexis as they were a great team working together to keep birds away from families dining outdoors and ensured all guests had what they needed.  It was like watching a perfect dance between them.  Peter was our waiter and was very attentive and very kind.  He never made us feel like we were a bother with any request we had.  We walked into breakfast 15 minutes before they closed, but they never made us feel rushed and had all the food out for us as if we were there when they first opened. The next day we got a luxury poolside cabana and Amith and Nagur helped us there.  Amith got us great seats by the pool and set everything up for us, beautifully. They were both very genuine and service was great.  They even surprised us with flowers and a dessert for our anniversary.  They both made us feel like we were VIPs.  The drinks were delicious too thanks to Indika, the bartender!  He made sure that our drinks came out promptly but also, made some of the best cocktails we had!!  We got a chance to see him in action the next day and it was impressive.  They were busy, but he had a big smile on his face and kept pumping out the drinks all while making jokes and having fun with his team.  Although our interaction was brief, Gomaa, the assistant manager at SAL pool was very friendly and accommodating!  Shaheen, our buggy driver, took us to multiple restaurants, but he talked to us about the different hotels and restaurants along the way, almost like a tour guide.  He even offered to take pictures for us when we asked to stop for a quick photo.  He took us to the best photo stops too and never rushed us nor made us feel like an inconvenience.  It was a great stay thanks to all the staff, to include Diane who assisted us upon our arrival.  We will be back next year again!","5","2023-09"
"Hotel Tour was not the worth what they charge ","reason for rating low is the cost they charge from hotel tour was 250 diram and what they show is 2 royal suites which has been converted to museums, and main lobby we can't wait and have proper look, just have to walk towards lift to see suits.
Didnt showed rooms which they provide to their guest.
Can't see tennis area on top.
Can't see restaurant.
You have to pay additional 50 diram drink to see 26th floor sky lounge if you want.
What they provide is small welcome drink, wet towel, 1 full size dates and small cup Arabic coffee.
Not worth the price.","1","2023-09"

Salute to A Great Team","5","2023-09"
"Don't believe the hype!!!","I booked to stay at Burj Al Arab for one night in a panoramic suite as a surprise for my husband, our two year old daughter was with us too. Unfortunately our stay was extremely disappointing.

Firstly, I'll give credit where it's due - Sal beach club is beautiful and couldn't fault the attentiveness of staff around the pool. We had a great day in a cabana and the lunch in the restaurant was delicious.

It then all went down hill from there. We ordered room service at 7.30pm - with an infant this was the easiest option and we also wanted to spend time in our suite - however 9pm rolled around and we were still waiting for our food. Our daughter was so over tired by this point, screaming and starving! We messaged on E-Butler who replied saying they would get back to us, yet they never did. We called up at 9.10pm seeking an update only to be told that they missed our order and we would need to wait another 30min! We cancelled the food as we needed to settle our daughter and try and put her to sleep - albeit having no dinner!!! I then tried to heat her milk up, but the kettle didn't work, so we then had to continue waiting for a new kettle! Makes you wonder how often the staff actually pay attention to details in the room. The manager offered a fruit platter to apologise (!!) but it was too little too late by that point we just wanted to go to bed so we could get up and leave. We would have been better off ordering Uber Eats. We would have received better service in a bed and breakfast. Completely and utterly disappointing and ruined our whole stay as we were waiting in our room all evening for absolutely nothing!!!

Panoramic suite was a good space, however you could smell the scent of old cigarettes and the muskiness hits you as you walk through the door. The sofa smelt especially bad. The robes in the bathroom have seen better days too - old and tired.

Overall, this hotel would be good to spend a day at however I wouldn't bother with staying over night - you are paying for the name and there are much much much better options in Dubai so save your money.","1","2023-09"
"online experience","My experience is not the visit itself. it is the website of burj al arab- i spent 3 hours trying to book a tour and dinner at IWAN- and i was in a hurry to do the booking and gift it to a couple. every time it shows error. then I called the hotel. I was surprised telling me - please call back tomorrow and the tour team will assist you - may be the website is not working only when they are operational. 
i don't find this normal at all- we are in 2023! and we are using a supposed 7* hotel where I do not expect this delay or difficulty to book online through its platform.

It is really weird. 
I m speechless and don't know if I have to make a try tomorrow or search for another destination to book for my  friends.","2","2023-09"
"cocktails in the sky bar","Went to the sky bar on the 27th floor with my husband. was a wonderful experience. staff were very friendly and attentive. very good passion fruit martini and the best expresso martini too.  he had long island iced teas. very beautiful hotel. great experience.   ","5","2023-09"
"Luxurious and Elegant","We booked our stay at Burh Al Arab using Amex FHR which includes possible early check-in,  100usd credits, guaranteed late check out. We had a really nice stay in the hotel. Check-in was smooth and the reception lady even guided us to the room and provided details about the hotel and facilities. Love that there is complimentary tour as well. Kudos to Thyra, Nikola and the Manager in Sahn Eddar as they were very quick in helping out when we spill our drink. Also good job to Dharamjit who toured us around in the buggy showing the different hotels of Jumeirah. Dilsholbek who served us during our breakfast buffet was also very accommodating and helpful. The gym was huge and had state of the art equipment. The only issue we encountered was during our check-out date, someone called in our room informing us that we are already supposed to check out and was very pushy and adamant with regards to it. We told her that we had a paper saying guaranteed late check out but did not seem to believe. Would have been better if she double checked first on their side then got back to us but her tone was not very nice. Then our keycard access was no longer working for the elevator and as well as for our room so we could not enter back which was such a hassle. We even messaged the e-butler service which replied that they will check but never got back to us with regards to the confirmation of our late check out. Was not a good experience for a hotel of this reputation. Overall we still loved our stay as everyone else was very nice and helpful.","5","2023-09"
"Beautiful hotel, A++ service ","The service at this hotel is above and beyond!!   From the moment we walked in until the moment we left!!   Omar and Rhoda our butlers were amazing.  They really made our honeymoon so special with so many unexpected surprises.   Thank you!!!   Ululbek in the concierge set up all our plans and did an excellent job!!   Top notch.   Can’t wait to come back.  ","5","2023-09"
"WOW!!! Truly 7*","WOW!! Don't have many other words to explain what our stay was like other than wow. Burj Al Arab definitely lives up to the 7* service reputation. Will definitely be going back to stay again. Went here to celebrate our anniversary and was looked after like royalty.","5","2023-08"
"Great Hotel...Staff Makes it Exceptional","Where to begin? Let's start with the staff - it is outstanding one in all aspects of your operation. From the front desk to the butler, housekeeping, restaurant staff, front door...you name it. Each and every person we met was pleasant, greeted us with genuine enthusiasm, and were simply phenomenal. We have stayed in places like that before (i.e. in Bora Bora), but this was unmatched. 

I expect that from the front desk and waitstaff - they are guest facing. But the warm greetings come from all avenues, right down to the guys mopping the expansive pool deck in 106-degree heat to the people polishing the gold at night. Everyone makes you feel like a cherished guest, and it's not phony. I hate phony people pretending they're happy to see you. Fortunately, I didn't experience that even once at the BAA.

Second, I the hotel is amazingly maintained. ""Clean"" doesn't begin to describe it. Immaculate may be a better word, and I know what kind of challenge that must be. The cleaning staff should be commended for their outstanding efforts. The room was immaculate. Always. You will be hard-pressed to find a greasy fingerprint anywhere in that expansive property. The pool attended even came by to brush the sand off our towels next to the pool. That's something I have never experienced before. Simply phenomenal service.

I also love that you have people from around the world working there. It was fun having conversations with such a diverse range of people from different geographies and cultures.

Kudos to the concierge team, especially Simone. Using What's App was a perfect way for us to communicate, and I appreciate their help in making arrangements around Dubai for us.

Here is one of my favorite stories about the service: we were taking early morning pictures on the bridge and a driver in a buggy stopped. He offered to take us to an even better spot near the beach and then drove us around to another spot along the side of the hotel for more pictures (my wife loves taking and sharing pictures on social media). He didn't need to stop and do any of that for us, but that's emblematic of the kind of service we received at the Burg-al-Arab.

This is also one of the most picturesque places you will ever stay. I uploaded a few of the countless photos and videos we took. If you like posting to Instagram, this is the place for you.

If there was anything disappointing about the experience, it's that we couldn't stay longer.  I knew that the BAA was iconic, but it's how you are running the place and the simply amazing staff that truly made this memorable.","5","2023-09"
"AMAZING!","Do not believe anyone telling you this is a 7 star hotel. It is a 10 star. Just magnificent from start to finish. The staff starting with Samuel greeting us (who should get a big raise for how terrific he is) to the butlers, the waiters, the pool staff...amazing. The food was a big wow. Al Mahara in the top 3 restaurants we have ever been to. OUR HIGHEST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. Congrats to all.","5","2023-09"
"A wonderful experience!","For many people this is truly a once in a lifetime experience, a bucket list item.  Exemplary service, large suites, and a truly exclusive property.  In a city of many 5 star hotels, the Burj Al Arab rates 7 stars!","5","2023-09"
"Amazing visit ","This hotel is just WOW stunning, felt very glam another Dubai hotel ticked off the list. The service was amazing staff were very helpful and friendly. Can’t wait to visit again, food and drinks are great. ","5","2023-09"
"Subpar service despite the seven star price","I am currently sitting in the Burj Al Arab lobby, waiting for our room. This is our second stay here. The first time, my husband and I came alone and had a wonderful time. So we decided to return with our family, (toddlers aged 2 and 5 yo in tow). We arrived on an early morning flight at 3am after a 13hr flight followed by an 8hr layover. We arrived at the hotel at 6am. Our room will not be ready until 10am at the earliest. My children are sleeping soundly on the lobby sofa, both on our laps. The manager invited us for breakfast and I requested that we go in about an hour as I did not want to wake my sleeping children. He then offered for us to move to the second floor lobby, so that it would be “more private” for us. I declined, as I did not want to wake my sleeping children. He then requested that we move because it “does not look nice” for children to be sleeping in the main lobby area on one of the sofas. The UAE is generally a very family friendly place. I am so disappointed that this seven star hotel would not have more tact or interpersonal skill than this. A hotel manager at what is supposed to be one of the best hotels in the world not so subtly suggests we move our sleeping children away from the lobby area because it does not look nice. On one hand I can somewhat understand wanting to maintain an image, on the other hand I would have hoped if hospitality was to be a driving force at a hotel then suggestions as callus as this would not occur especially after what has been a long time traveling with tired children. It’s very disappointing especially considering this is the beginning of our stay and a vacation, to then be reminded that maintaining an image is more important. Ironic that this is all while there are construction workers right outside and the lobby area itself has more cleaners than actual guests in it.","1","2023-09"
"The Burj Al Arab is a luxury hotel",". Magic stay at the Burj Al Arab. The place is amazing, the view from the suite, the design of the hotel...
The beds in the suite are so comfortable, I never experience such quality bed sheets before. This reaches another quality level!
The service is also excellent, you feel at home with lot of nice attentions. We could not have expected more!
The swimming pool is wonderful with a nice view on the palm, very comfortable sun beds and nice ambiance.
The breakfast was the best I ever had in a hotel with lot of choices, quality ingredients and very good service. Thank you very much Omar for jacuzzi assistance and Reception team for giving Certainly providing  chocolate mousse cake for my friend Birthday she very happy ","5","2023-09"
"Wonderlust","One of my favorite places to go to, elegant and iconic. I have been in their resturants and spa facilities, amazing service and stunning view. Burj al arab is my go to place for relaxation and entertainment, recommend to have a try and experience the place.","5","2023-09"
"Sunset drinks in the Sky Lounge …..","We stayed in this fabulous and iconic Hotel a few years ago for my special Birthday. It was amazing then. We wanted to come back for drinks on our Silver Wedding Anniversary as this Hotel holds such special memories for us. 
We booked the Sky Lounge to watch the sun set and were not disappointed. 
The Hotel is as beautiful as ever, the staff equally fantastic. 
We were given a wonderful table with the perfect view. My bag even had its own little chair 😆. Our server was an Australian young man and sadly we didn’t catch it name. He was  great and a credit to the Hotel. I was presented with the most beautiful bouquet of pink roses and a beautiful dessert for our Anniversary. It was so unexpected and the most thoughtful gesture I was blown away. 
This really made our Anniversary. 
We will definitely be coming back to stay here very soon. 

Thank you all for making our 25th anniversary so very special.","5","2023-09"
"Excellent service and amazing staff!!!!!❤️","we stayed one week in the hotel and we had so much fun! since we are a small family of four we managed to visit all the facilities in the hotel. everyone were happy and pleased with our stay, service is excellent, very clean and neat hotel rooms, food was really great, 10 of 10!!!

"World class hotel. Iconic service","World class service, iconic experience.

This was our second visit; we came in April this year and the consistency of experience is unrivalled. There is not a detail that is missed, the staff are all world class and make you feel very special indeed. For me, what continues to set the Burj apart is the ability for it to deliver the very highest end experience, yet still make it feel relaxed and comfortable. There is absolutely no pretension. Across our 2 trips, we ate at Al Iwan, Al Muntaha and enjoyed a drink at Gilt. We also had lunch by the pool. All of the restaurants are unreal, but for me, the absolute highlight is the breakfast, which is simply fabulous. 

It’s a strange thing to say about a hotel that’s upwards of $2000 a night, but value wise, it’s incredible. Considering, that on a busy night in London you might pay almost equivalent for a small junior suite in an anonymous hotel , but here you are staying in a genuinely world-class destination, with personalised service.

Lots has been said about this iconic hotel, but it simply doesn’t disappoint and delivers an unforgettable stay.","5","2023-07"
"Marvellous experience, unforgettable stay","Service, food, room, architecture.. everything was just exceptionally amazing. Due to our flight, we arrived here in the morning time. With their exceptional  service, we could check in early and didnt have to go out to fill the empty time. No word needed. Just experience Burj Al Arab!","5","2023-08"
"Amazing hotel","We recently stayed at the Burj al Arab. It was everything we thought it would be from arrival to departure. The staff was there to help us. The rooms are unbelievable. The hotel is luxurious. It is what it is. It’s the pinnacle of five star hotels. The details, the service, breakfast in the bedroom in the morning, I mean I could go on and on. I went to the spa every day, did the ice bath and sauna. I mean, it’s just simply amazing.","5","2023-07"
"Dubai Burj Al Arab 😎👍","Great iconic hotel. A must stay in Dubai. 10 day Family stay 2 adults and 2 kids. Had one little set back with service at the Main Pool. Dealt with very well by management. Breakfast was nice and healthy with the option of having in-room as well. Massage was quality. The unlimited access to wild wadi was great for the kids. Security was top notch and hospitality was very pleasant. 
Dubai offers so much to do. Our 10 ten visit still wasn’t enough.","5","2023-08"
"Afternoon Tea/tour in the burg al arab","We attended the Burg Al Arab in a group of 4 consisting of a 79 year old, and 2 45 year old and a 14 year old. We arrived to complete the tour and afternoon tea, the staff were great however the afternoon tea was not up to standard and was very poor not worth the price that we paid. Considering this  hotel is meant to be one of the iconic hotels in the world it let's itself down when it comes to the afternoon tea.  Disappointing.","2","2023-08"
"Another Wonderful Stay at ‘The Burj’","This was our second stay at the Burj al-Arab hotel in Dubai.
And like the first, it was a ‘staycation’, because we had suites in Festival City Dubai,
and came here just for a day or two, out of our ‘regular’, already quite wonderful tourist experience 
In the UAE, which we love.
We are Israelis, and have enjoyed true Arab hospitality here 6 times since March 2022.
I am here with my 8 year old godson, his father and a 10 year old cousin.
My godson, when asked what he wanted for his birthday, immediately said, “a stay in the Burj 
al-Arab, when we go to the UAE!” I agree immediately.
It is wonderful, and among those I must compliment on their service and devotion to making their
Guests feel welcomed, are our Butler on the 10th floor, and the wonderful Indian gentleman in the Spa, who is really a gentleman! He was wonderful with all of us but was especially endearing to my 8 year old godson Eitan, whom he totally spoiled. Although in truth he totally spoiled ALL four of us! Nothing was too much trouble for him. 
But all the staff were amazing!
And the suite is so OTT, but with that, somehow welcoming and even homey.
We loved our stay and will return.","5","2023-08"
"This hotel is over the top","As a connect of flights, my daughter and I only spent two nights at Burj Al Arab. But the whole experience was fantastic. The room was specious and sparklingly clean. The service made us feel at home. We suffered from jet lag so we woke up our butler at 3 am. He came very quickly and served us with great hospitality. We will definitely go back again. ","5","2023-08"
"Bathroom not clean","The bathroom was not clean, feedback to the management but they only took photos from my Hp and replied they will investigate. Not worth staying as the cleanliness of the bathroom was not that great. Hope the management will take note and improve further.","1","2023-08"
"Best Hotel in the world ","I’m in love with this fascinating hotel , so classy 2 floor suite with free Amenities , free perfume from Hermes  as a welcome  gesture 😍
I am in love with the staff and the managers they make you feel special , big thanks to Diana the guest relation manager for always surprising me and looking after me every stay  she is adorable 
Pansy from reservation how amazing is she , she does beautiful magic to make you happy and pleased to book , I’m dealing with her since many years , thanks to Bovi please ask for her for best message in the world

"Breach Of Security in room suite","Unfortunately upon my check out, an employee of the hotel knocked on the door and entered the room suite directly, i was shocked and this shouldn't happen in Burj Al Arab. Anyway both my families and I are very upset and hurt about this incident. Since then no compensation has been done!","1","2023-08"
"As good as ever!","From the airport pick up to the airport drop off a seamless experience. Some parts of the hotel were not open, but after the pandemic what can you expect? If you eat, drink and sleep you will not be disappointed. As usual the rear deck and pools look fantastic, but in 38deg sitting in Sal's air conditioning sipping the odd cocktail can't be beaten. Al Muntaha food is as good as ever, the service excellent. The food in Sal excellent and the service exceptional. Tried Pierchic this time and must say the food and service were as expected, excellent.","5","2023-07"
"Beautiful hotel, big rooms, very detailed in everything.","Beautiful and clean hotel.  Suit very comfortable, with everything you need.  Modern with all the gadgets you will need for cellphones, ipads, etc.  Big bathroom with jacuzzi.

"An experience of a life time for sure!!","Words are inadequate to begin to describe the experience we had!

It is one of the places on earth you MUST visit/stay in for sure!

We were there on a family vacation and had informed them of a birthday celebration, our concierge went out of his way to gather about eight (8) other staff members to come to sing Happy Birthday to my daughter!!

Nothing was too little or too much for them to do to make our stay extremely memorable!!

Thank you so much for making me our dream a reality!!

","5","2023-07"
"Awesome hotel, amazing people!","The hotel was great, but the best part was meeting the doorman Achol Mordicai. He was a beautiful human being and he took care of us like we were his family. I would come back here again just to see him again. The hotel should give him a promotion!","5","2023-08"
"Expensive but worth every cent","It is the best hotel in the world!
It is worth staying at least two days one is to short and you won't get the full experience.
Breakfast in your room is a must.
Book for the sky bar as you arrive.!!!","5","2023-07"
"The Best Hotel in the world","At least, a 2 to 5 night stay in Burj Al Arab Hotel is enough to heal you mentally, physically, and emotionally. You will get 200% value for your money (not an exaggeration). Everything was perfect; professional, helpful and friendly staff (most especially Natalia, Uttam, Habib, Mansour and Gautam Nayak) excellent service delivery, quality food, etc. ","5","2023-07"

"It is Truly The only 7 Star Hotel in The World","There are many fantastic hotels out there but there is only one that stands out as the best of the best in my  ( and my family's) opinion:  The Burj Al Arab.   Each visit is catered just for your liking. No matter how many times you stay with Burj Al Arab, it only gets better and better and better.   
Try it.  It is truly the only 7 Star Hotel in the world.  
You will not be disappointed.  ","5","2023-07"
"Fantastic Afternoon Tea","Fantastic afternoon Tea - we were asked to show our reservation details at the entry to the causeway, no booking, no entry.  Once in the hotel oh my goodness, this place is truly wonderful.  Afternoon tea was served one floor up, the escalators take you past the fountains and we were met by the restaurant receptionist.  We were seated at a really comfortable sofa and were given the drinks menu, speciality teas and coffees were unlimited and included in the price.  The afternoon tea was delicious and looked so attractive.","5","2022-12"
"Amazing experience, few things that could be improved.","This was a highly anticipated stay, having always wanted to stay but never managing to do it before now. Stayed for 3 nights. Very fortunate to have a suite near the top of the building which meant the views were truly spectacular. The hard product in the hotel is excellent and whilst it is now a comparatively older Dubai hotel, it’s still very special. The suite was 1800 square feet and very comfortable.

The food and beverage is excellent throughout and had the opportunity to dine at Al Mahara, Al Iwan (buffet) Sal (beach club restaurant) and use all the bars and lobby lounge. Room service prices were lower than expected.

What I think could be improved:

1. Butler service was very good but would prefer a dedicated butler, rather than multiple interactions with many butlers). Did not like communicating via whatsapp. The system works, but I go on holiday to escape my phone, not use it.

2. Increase the day pass price for Sal Beach club significantly. Too many visitors from outside the hotel. It didn’t feel luxury and was not private.

3. Stop the hotel tours. Too many people who were not staying at the hotel. The staff were good at managing it;( and kept it separate) but I didn’t like groups of people in the lobby/ by the elevators. I appreciate hotels need extra revenue streams but I think there’s better ways to do this at this hotel that would be less impactful for the actual residents.

3. Service levels were not equitable to luxury hotels I have stayed in previously. The majority of staff did not know who you were. This sounds pompous to write but when you asked who you are and are you staying here, repeatedly, all day, everyday, it becomes frustrating. At this price level, I expect personalised service and the hotel did not deliver. 

What I liked:

1.Excellent hard product
2. Excellent spa services and indoor pool (the spa staff and changing room attendants were outstanding) 
Food and beverage quality was very high throughout. 
3.Kindly given an upgrade in room and transfer vehicle.Thank you! 

Enjoyed the stay, very much, but I have stayed in hotels with higher quality and more personalised service at a similar price or less. Nevertheless, will definitely return. It’s unique!","5","2023-05"

"Burj al arab stay was very bad experience","When we reached there we have to wait for our room and they not give our room at time and there staff they are very haughty if we require any thing we have to wait if you take any service before they remind you that service we already provide why we give so much amount for stay in 7 star hotel very bad experience over all i will give zero marks to this Burj Al Arab hotel We spent the winning money in this hotel, if we had spent it in any other hotel, we would have lived like a king in that hotel and refused to demand anything like a beggar in this hotel.","1","2023-06"
"Unfortunately, it did not provide an authentic experience, or exceeded luxury expectations.","My family and I arrived at Burj Al Arab on  Sunday, June 29th for 2 nights —-  the occasion, to celebrate my 37th birthday. The experience met lived up to expectations,  it did not exceeded. 

Upon arrival we were greeted with genuine beauty of the hotel, and it’s majestic architectural designs. We felt welcomed at check in; however, we didn’t felt genuine hospitality, or “wow” factor. Our hostess did an excellent job guiding us though the resort, its amenities — and showed genuine care towards our 3yr old.

Our Deluxe Two Bedroom Suite was lavish, comfortable and provided the best views; however, the butler service was superb; however it lacked the engagement compared to other high luxury properties.

Challenges —- our first night my family and I were confronted by an attended/or pool side host “if we were staying at the hotel”, and to display credentials. I felt diminished, and offended by her attitude. During first breakfast, we wanted a birthday surprise by ordering “gold coffee” at the restaurant —- the manager refused, and challenged us “returned customer” that having that service during breakfast was never applied. Lastly, the family pool was unattended and service was extremely poor —- I order a frozen pina collada, and received a glass of semi-cold milk. 

Highlights —- Clifford, the restaurant manager, took ownership of the “gold coffee fiasco” and provided an authentic/personalized service, one staying at Burj Arab should be expect.","4","2023-06"

The facility was very opulent, well kept and beautiful. ","5","2023-06"

"Amazing hotel","Worth all the hype.  This is a beautiful, one-of-a-kind hotel with the most striking suites and services.  After the suites, the level of service is also the most notable.

Everything was perfect from start to finish. My son spent his first birthday here and the staff made it extra special. it was just amazing. they even gave him a personalised teddy bear with miles on the hood. it was an experience that we will never forget. 

The butler unpacked my suitcases and repacked them. nothing was too much to ask for. 

The bottles of Hermes at the side of the bathroom sink. everything is so special. 

thank you to all staff for making our stay so special","5","2023-06"
"Without a doubt, the greatest hotel on planet Earth","5 stars would never do this place justice, I have never seen such a display of pristine opulence in my entire life. The sterling service begins from the moment your car arrives in front of the door, where the many doormen will personally escort you through the front doors, wishing you a warm welcome to this veritable palace. Achol in particular is excellent at his job, and you may remember him from a certain viral video. They are always on standby to assist with anything you could need, and that goes for every single staff member inside the hotel. You are pampered beyond belief, and everything proceeds with a level of hospitality I had only ever seen on cruise ships prior to this point. The on-site dining is both a delight to taste and to experience, as each venue comes included with yet another sensory experience to marvel at while you dine. The facilities are also top notch, with a gorgeous pool and beach area and rooms I would be happy to stay in forever. Bottom line, you can’t miss the Burj.","5","2023-06"
"More than money can buy","In case you want to experience one, if not the best, moment in time to celebrate life, or really anything, you really want to book a few days in the Burj Al Arab. 

We went back for our anniversary,  - after we were here for the same reason a few years ago - , and it has been an amazing and wonderful time.

Sure enough the hotel is special, the views from the suites outstanding and the Michelin restaurants blew as away; but what makes it really special are the people, the team who were once again able to make this stay unforgettable. We would need to list like 20 people and probably miss many but we have to mention Jenny our suite butler who created the most personal anniversary gift one could ask for. She and Aimie deserve to be mentioned. 

thank you to all of you, we are very grateful and love the fact we live in Dubai, so we can even pass by for a wonderful afternoon tea!

Thank you!

"Amazing Stay 😍","We had the most amazing stay at the Burj Al Arab with our boys! Nothing was too much trouble for our Butler Noel, she was very attentive, always had a smile on her face and was a pure delight! 

Also a very special mention to Joshua at the Front of House! A credit to Jumeirah corporation! Very welcoming, enthusiastic and a pleasure to know! THANK YOU! 

We had a memorable stay!

"Excellent stay","Been going to Dubai for 20 yrs this hotel has just won me back to Dubai Absolutely amazing hotel everything was amazing  nothing was a problem the service was incredible.
Everything you could ever want at Breakfast was available.
The only thing is I had to leave will definitely be back soon","5","2023-06"
"Best Hotel on the Planet","The most amazing experience on the planet ever. This hotel is on another planet. It began with our arrival and greeting, especially from the legend Achol and his associate (not sure of name)….these two legends are AMAZING. From there, it didn’t stop. The service is 11/10. It’s the most amazing experience of service and most amazing hotel in the world.","5","2023-06"
"La Vela di Dubai","Everything was wonderful, we stayed in the panoramic suite and it was amazing, the view of the city looked like from an airplane. The impeccable welcome, like the availability and attention for all your needs.
Dream breakfast and infinity pool.
A special mention to Zhanna who made us feel perfectly at ease and satisfied us for any request.","5","2023-06"
"Worst experience","Paying $100 to tour this hotel with soda as soft drink offering was worst experience… no excitement when looking at the deluxe bedrooms … staff members are rude … will never recommend this over hyped hotel to anyone … don’t recommended for the price you pay … there are lot of good hotels in Vegas … please stay away and save your money ","1","2023-06"
"Luxury stay in Dubai","Wonderful hotel. Amazing rooms. Great staff. Very clean. Housekeeping and butler service excellent. 
In Room dining very good. Turn down service excellent. Very polite housekeeping staff.
Breakfast area is outdated and needs a complete make over. Chipped paint and tiles obvious and not in keeping with a 7 star rating at all. The buffet selection was poor although the A La Carte menu was good. This definitely needs improvement. The tours in the lobby is again not in keeping with a luxurious hotel of this calibre. It makes it quite common and commercialised. We did the tour as In House Guests and the man at the reception of the tour area was less than friendly. He was the only staff member that I would say was rude/obnoxious and  needs training.
The check out was very chaotic with lots of people shoving their way to the desk. No privacy at all. Would suggest separate desks/booths for check out.
Otherwise a very memorable stay.","5","2023-06"
"A Day to Remember","Most hotels look the same. This is why I love hotels with personalities, and the Burj Al Arab excels in this regard. It looks nothing like I saw before, and that's from someone who has visited countless luxury hotels around the world.

The staff is super courteous, and everyone calls you by name. As for the food, it is some of the finest in town.

I wanted to celebrate my 50th birthday in a memorable, unforgettable way, and I was not disappointed. Highly recommended, must-see, must-visit hotel.","5","2023-06"
"best hotel in the world ","the best hotel ive ever stayed in the room service was amazing I would highly recommend to stay here the food was brilliant staff was so nice the pool was really cold and nice to swim in. best hotel In dubai and maybe in the world 
","5","2023-06"
"Bucket list","If you’re looking for that once-in-a-lifetime experience, then this is it. Extravagant, exaggerated, and over the top - but it works so well. The architecture is outstanding. You will be treated like royalty and it feels awesome! Everyone is so helpful and attentive - no ask is too big. There is something very special about this hotel and the people working there. An absolute bucket list / special occasion hotel!","4","2023-03"
"If you’re looking for something special","Best of the best. Amazing service, perfect food, spacious beautiful rooms, super comfy and nice beach, nice pool area with conditioning cabanas, professional butler service, no doubt the best hotel in Dubai","5","2023-05"
"Burj Al Arab Experience","Special mention to our butlers Cherodel and Sunita who were superb and really made our stay very, very special. They are an asset to your organisation.
The Concierge Service was also good and the gentleman at the entrance lobby were polite and friendly and made as feel welcomed.
We also met a very friendly and knowledgable young man at the SAL beach bar - Mohamed Gomaa who was able to resolve our issues in a very professional way, once again a credit to the organisation. Finally, the staff at the checkout desk were equally amazing. We can't wait to come back.","5","2023-05"
"A wonderful Christmas Break","Christmas/New Year Trip.  we had a wonderful time . highly recommended- stayed twice before and still wonderful.
Food is to die for ,we do not drink too much but what we had was very much quality. Thank you for such a fabulous stay and looking after us. Karen","4","2022-12"
"For the money nice room but not worth it","Wife and I stayed for 1 night as little treat to ourselves. 
We had a friend meeting us for afternoon tea and they treated him like garbage at the security desk before getting across the bridge to hotel and then front desk staff also. 
Breakfast had some nice options but I’ve had better at far cheaper properties. Hotel got rid of in suite checkin/check out. 
They seem to be resting on their laurels rather than actually trying to provide outstanding service. Nothing done about rude and entitled other guests either. ","3","2023-05"
"Asim Khan service was Excellent!","Dear Team, 

It’s a pleasure to be here always. I would like to highly recommend Mr. Asim Khan working in Sahn Eddar.

"Amazing!","The Burj Al Arab is a beautiful and exceptional resort.  I loved the private beach and the elegant spa. The dining is exquisite and the entry and throughout the  resort is unbelievable..The staff is so warm and welcoming.  The ambience and presentation when first walking into my suite took my breath away.  It was more then I could ever asked for.. The views are over the top. I could not have made a better choice and so happy that I chose to stay here.  Anyone traveling to Dubai, I strongly recommend the Burj Al Arab for your accommodations and other needs.  This is truly a 7 Star Hotel/Resort and I cannot wait to return! Live in Peace Always, Catherine G.","5","2023-05"
"Burj Al Arab - 40th Birthday Trip","Trip was as amazing as expected, levels of service are truly 7 stars and special mention of Aldrin the head butler who made sure the trip was extra special!!! 

The room is bigger than my first house and I now believe I have felt what it’s like to be royalty. Attention detail better to any other hotel I have ever been to.

"Sal beach club at burj al Arab was beautiful!","We had the most amazing time at Sal beach club at the burj Aj Arab. We arrived early at 10am so we could secure our bed near the salt water infinity pool. The first few rows are reserved for hotel guests but they do give you the best row for non-guests if you arrive early. We were celebrating a birthday and my friend was presented with beautiful flowers & a birthday desert. We had the best lunch there, I felt the prices were reasonable for such a prestigious hotel. The food was excellent. Service to the beds for drinks was impeccable and every member of staff were accommodating. Sal is one of the only beach clubs in Dubai where you can truly relax for the day. The music was perfectly chilled throughout our day. We can’t wait to return!","5","2023-03"
"Amazing Experience","We stayed at this beautiful hotel for my wife’s birthday. And they made sure that we would have the best time of over life. The experience was absolutely incredible and staff was amazing. Just can’t wait to visit again.","5","2023-05"
"What a magnificent day!","Thank you so much to all of the amazing staff at Sal beach club. We hired a luxury cabana for the day and it was incredible. We had such an amazing day. The staff were so attentive, the food amazing and the surroundings incredible. I can not recommend this experience enough. Thank you!!!","5","2023-05"
"Amazing","Amazing experience, overall service and staff excellent. I have stayed at many hotels and resorts around the world but The Burj is definitely on a level of its own. The panoramic suite is absolutely breathtaking. ","5","2023-05"
"Nice Hotel Ruined by Snobby Rude Uma Lounge","The hotel itself is quite nice and the staff is very nice including at Inside the Burj tour.  Additionally the female staff at Uma lounge is friendly (don't have names) but of the male staff they are very snobby and rude.  The prices at Uma are very high and you accept that because it's Burj Al Arab but you also expect good service. It took nearly half an hour to get a waiter to come over when we wanted the bill and even so he was quite annoyed to be flagged down.  We asked him for takeaway for the children's meal  as it had come late and was quite hot. The waiter tersely replied ''you can't take it away, we don't allow that.''  His tone was so terse and unapologetic for a very overpiced kids pasta that was not served in a timely fashion to begin with.  I told him we'd appreciate still to take it home at our own risk. He said in a very aggressive tone (more then before) Did you ask the waiter before you ordered if you'd be able to take it home?  I told him we expected to receive it on time and would have no reason to suspect it could not be taken home as it's uncommon and unannounced.   He walked away and had a different waiter come with the bill. There was never a thank you for patronizing or sorry for an inconvenience.  It was the exact opposite experience of the rest of the hotel and reminded me of the shadiest places I've ever unfortunately patronized . The service was overall worse then any 2 star restaurant and in and of itself takes the experience far below what one would expect of Burj Al Arab.    While there policy and not advising of it on the menu was bothersome, it was the rude attitude encountered that ended the day at Burj Al Arab on a sour note of what would have elsewise been a great day. A 7 star hotel with a 1 star restaurant.","2","2023-05"
"Day feeling like royalty! ","We spent the day at the SAL pool and had the best day ever! We felt like queens! Our wonderful waiter ROBERT was absolutely amazing! Super attentive and so so friendly. He was very helpful and lovely to chat to! ","5","2023-05"
"Wonderful Stay","Our entire stay in burj al arab was amazing!  All the staff were extremely helpful especially Lyn who made our experience/stay extra special. We'll definitely go back again and would highly recommend this to everyone. ","5","2023-04"
"Only if I can see","I mean it is amazing to go there but the. If you are not staying there , you are immediately turned down even for a photo shoot. There is one person at the first entrance asking your room number , if you don’t have one then you are rejected. The only way to see it I guess is to get a tour ticket.","4","2023-05"
"NYC April 24-26, 2023","The staff was extremely helpful but Vidhi and Angelica made the experience/stay that much more memorable. Will definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends.  Complimentary room upgrade upon arrival, followed by exceptional service and amenities","5","2023-05"
"Wonderful experience in Sahn Edgar , Burj Al Arab","We have lunch in the Sahn Edda restaurant the food and the environment are excellent , the service is exceptional well, especially one of the waitresses WanWan is very friendly and provides excellent professional services.

"Burg Al Arab - Magical","Our stay at Burj Al Arab was in a word, Magical. From the moment we arrived, throughout our stay, and the way we were treated during our departure made it easy to see why this is the world’s top luxury seven star hotel. The staff is there to make your every need a reality. Although the entire staff was wonderful, there are a few people who I must mention. Gautam, who is the Butler Manager, was amazing!!  He saw that all of our needs were immediately handled. He personally oversaw some of his butler staff, while they unpacked Mary’s and my luggage, so that we could go and enjoy the pool and facilities upon our arrival and also so that we could maximize our enjoyment on our final day. He also handled many of our unique requests and saw that they were met immediately. Even following our return to the states, he continued to reply to questions that I had regarding the incredibly comfortable bedding that we had in our suite. We felt like we were sleeping in clouds in that wonderfully comfortable bed. There are not enough words with which to praise him. Sanjay, one of the fantastic butlers, took care of us during much of our stay. He made our stay there so easy and so pleasurable and personally saw to it that our anniversary was extremely special. On our anniversary night, he brought an amazing cake for Mary and an incredible all fruit exquisite tart for me due to my dietary restrictions. This was after he drew us a wonderful bath, which was waiting for us when we came up from the pool deck. There were many other requests, which we had which were immediately taken care of by Sanjay, as well as Sophie, another very kind and professional butler. Josh, who handled some of our phone calls prior to our arrival, also made our stay extremely pleasurable. He guided us to the type of room that we desired, and was available to us throughout our stay whenever we needed anything. We also had the pleasure of having him assist us with our departure.Ulekbek is one of the concierges at Burj Al Arab, who spoke with us prior to our arrival, and during our stay to accommodate any of our needs. He was extremely pleasant and willing to do whatever he could to help us with our reservations and excursions in Dubai. The staff throughout the hotel, restaurants and pool area were all extremely pleasant, accommodating and willing to help us out in any way, including taking many photos of us, so that we could memorialize our world class stay at Burj Al Arab. The hotel itself, the restaurants and pool area were all second to none. The food was utterly fantastic whether we were served in our room, at the poolside restaurant, SAL, and throughout the many other restaurants in the hotel. Our entire 15 day stay in Dubai and Abu Dhabi was a trip which we will never forget, but Burj Al Arab was most definitely the highlight. We are already planning our return trip next February. I can assure anyone who stays at Burj Al Arab that they will have an experience, which will remain a wonderful memory for a lifetime.","5","2023-03"
"Not for families. Lacks personality or exclusivity.","I have visit previously and service earlier was personalized and exclusive. All the brilliant staff from earlier is gone and this shows in service. 

Stayed in room 307 from 22-23 April. 

I was not happy with our experience at the pool area. It's a complete mess and so poorly organized. If we are hotel guests and we cannot secure a decent spot of preference over someone who is paying for the day pass its unfair. Both the days we were relegated to the family pool area in spite of asking for a place closer to the main pool. Full hotel is filled with people who are only visiting for the day pass or for a hotel tour. There is no exclusivity for guests who have booked to stay for the night. So many people are manning the pool entrance to welcome the guests. All are pretty yet not 1 senior and sensible person who can handle sitting arrangements for guests with families. All this when I am celebrating my birthday at the hotel. 

Food and service at the pool area is also poor. Shisha is also not good since they have changed the vendor recently as previously when i had stayed it was the best shisha I had. 

There were a few people who genuinely worked hard to make sure that we had a good time and I have to highlight them. Nitesh the manager at the beach club. He sincerely worked so hard and looked after us. If it was not for him we would have walked out of the pool area. Thank you Noorbah for the photos and Ibrahim and Hasan for salvaging the Shisha. Probably out of their control but the shisha was still terrible and not a patch on the previous vendor they had. Thank you to Ms. Varvara from the reception who welcomed us and gave us the perfect room. 

I also did not like the shakshuka at breakfast. 

My daughter loved the movie at the kids club; however this was only open from 4-6pm and was closed on the second da
Thank you to the butler who organized the Baklava.

This hotel is not for families since there is nothing for kids to do and they are catering more to a younger clientele who are visiting for the day and have more privileges than overnight guests. 

I would recommend Naseem by the same group at half the price which offers much better service and space. At best this is a one time visit since it is a magnificent structure but once the novelty factor fades away there is not much to hold your attention.","2","2023-04"
"Great time at UMA Outdoor Cafe","I had such an amazing time at Uma! Not only was food, music, and sunset beautiful, the staff was amazing as well! I want to thank Geri for being so kind and personable and also capturing beautiful photos of me and my fiancé. She truly made this a beautiful a memory.","5","2023-04"
"Burj al Arab was GREAT","It was a great expirience and we are thankful! 
Our driver Sherry did a wonderful job. We thank him very much!! 
We had the chance to dive into the world of Burj al Arab and it was really exciting! Everything was on time!!!","5","2023-04"
"Not happy at all!","During check-in problems with deposit credit card. Amount was charged but not available to use in resort. Burj Al Arab is way too commercial with tours for visitors from outside and I had to make a booking for every restaurant. I'm used to have a table available in this kind of luxury hotels at all time as in-house guest. Too rushed and not personal staff in ALL beach clubs and restaurants (even breakfast went wrong) of Jumeirah hotels nearby Burj Al Arab. This is definitely not worth the price!","2","2023-04"
"Family holiday","Everything was perfect, we come back again and again.We came for the first time with our two-year-old daughter and the attention of the staff to enrich her stay every day was fantastic. And thanks to the Babysitter service, we were able to enjoy two fine dining dinners.","5","2023-04"
"Getting even better","I have now had 50+ visits to BAA since 1999, but did not come in the last three years. A lot has changed, and only the better. Wearing nearly 25 years of age, each spot in this hotel looks like it was just finished. Perfect condition. They changed a lot of details over the years, some touches were removed, some added. In addition, it has really optimized and is even more beautiful. evolding the stunning terrade from SPACE to SALT, definetly makes sense. No buffet anymore for lunch or dinner at BAB AL YAM is actually also a good idea. ""E-Butler"" is the best service edition ever made, also the app room service ordering. Cabana service is actually superb. Since 1999, BAA has seen a transformation from a business and diplomatic hotel into a top hotspot for holiday makers. Allso noticeably less ""photo tourists"" in the lobby.  ","5","2023-04"
"Probably the most beautiful hotel in the world","There is no review that can actually let you understand what this hotel is all about.
If the Eiffel Tower represents Paris and the Big Ben represents London, the Burj al Arab represents Dubai.
Probably the most beautiful hotel I've ever been in.
A must.","5","2023-04"

"One of the best hotels in the world","Burj Al Arab wanted to be the best hotel in the world and for me it is. The rooms, the service, this super specific interior design, the feeling when you come in. The smell, the people, the vibe. It’s amazing. The outdoor area is breathtaking. One of the most beautiful areas in whole Dubai. I will come everytime again. ","5","2023-03"
"Best stay ever","We heard a lot about Burj Al Arab and were extremely exited to stay at this wonderful property for 6 days last week (Sky Palm suite). After our stay I can finally understand why there is so much talk about Burj Al Arab. Everything was at a highest level possible - rooms were beautiful and super luxurious, spa was awesome, breakfast was unbelievable - however, what made our stay very memorable was its staff starting from our greeting / check in agent, morning / night butlers, restaurant staff (diner at three of its restaurants - Al Muntaha, Ristorante L' Olivo at Al Mahara, and SAL). Overall, we probably had the best experience ever and are not strangers to luxury hotels. Look forward to coming back soon!","5","2023-03"
"Spa treatment fit for a king","Literally the best spa and amenities ever with a breaktaking view in the sauna, steam room and treatment rooms. The attention was amazing from the staff working in the amenities area.  I chose to get a 90 signature massage and the service was amazing. I left relaxed and feeling amazing for the 16 hour flight home to the United States. I can’t wait to come back and get pampered more. ","5","2023-03"

"Tired hotel now","I’ve stayed  the Burj four times over the years, it is now a tired hotel and is nothing special anymore. Dozens of cracked paving stones on the way to the pool, dirty external areas, restaurants closed down, service has slipped a lot. Lots of day trippers allowed. The place is really showing it’s age and now it’s chasing money so obviously. 
It’s lost it’s magic, just a very expensive hotel that’s living on past glory. It used to be special now it’s just average in a special building. Sad to see.","2","2023-02"

Good for the ego.","5","2023-03"

"An Experience Unlike Any Other","Hype is one thing, but delivering on that hype is something entirely different. The Burj Al Arab though, delivers consistently and spectacularly in every imaginable way.  

The site, the design, the interiors, the facilities and amenities, the flourishes and surprises will all dazzle you.  

But it is the service that lifts your step from the moment you arrive. Could not have been better…

Special thanks too all, and in particular… Merveille at Al Iwan (what a buffet!) went the extra mile… Achol and Samuel at front door who create the grand entrance that sets the tone for the entire stay… Cho who addressed a noise issue… Vittorio at reception, grazie Mille per tutto… Peter with the breakfast manakis surprise and the young French man in charge of breakfast who adroitly handled a rude Rsn guest… Venkat at the cabana for the special birthday surprises and a day of pampering for us both. And to so many others, thank you.","5","2023-03"
"It’s the only seven star for a reason","From the surprise upgrade, to the high level professionalism of the staff, the only hotel that had a separate gym for ladies, the suite, the restaurants..we felt like royals.

"Luxury along with a phenomenal team","What can I say about the Burj Al Arab, my husband and I stayed here in April 2022 and just because we were blown away by their personal attention to detail we went back for another stay in July 2022. I cannot recommend this place enough. From the moment we arrived we were seated and given some dates and Arabic coffee. Check in was done very comfortably with a young gentleman (apologies for forgetting everyone’s name), he didn’t just check us in but we had a lovely conversation about how he came to work for this hotel. This is nice as it adds a personal experience rather than a robotic one. We were then taken to our suite, we had zero expectations but walking into a small double storey apartment was definitely not what we were expecting. The room was just pure luxury, all the products were Hermes and they had added a perfume and cologne for both my husband and I from Hermes along with body lotions. We were explained how to use everything and that we had a butler on call 24/7. We also had access to the wadi water park included in our stay, we didn’t use this the first time but on the second visit we did and loved it. The lady who was assigned to us was amazing I think her name was Paula. She assisted us in all reservations for everything and also confirming our flight details. We had booked to have dinner at a Japanese restaurant at the hotel next door Jumeirah Al Naseem, when you come out of the doors of the Al Arab the kind doormen call a buggy for you which then takes you wherever you want within the vicinity. The breakfast buffet was very good, definitely one of the best I’ve had, pretty much anything you want is available. The pool side was amazing, there were some ‘influencers’ there just taking pics and giving a little show to all the guests that like us were raising eyebrows a bit, that was the only part I felt like it seemed a little cheap, however we live in a world that this is a part of life. If you get the chance go to the spa and have a massage, they have panoramic windows and we had a massage as the sun was setting, it was such a beautiful view, I was disappointed that I didn’t take my phone to take pictures but the spa is a great place to switch off. We had never planned to stay at the Al Arab just because we never thought of it as an option, however if you are in two minds just book it and go, this is definitely the kind of place you should try and do once in your life. I felt very blessed and fortunate that we stayed here. There is no pretentious behaviour from anyone you feel very at home. 😊","5","2022-04"
"Best Hotel Ever","From the start the room was beautiful, the staff amazing, food fantastic.  One of the best trips ever and the best hotel by far.  Not to be missed.  They even found a way to get the superbowl game feed to my room.  The staff and everything just superb.

"One night","After visiting Dubai several times we decided to book a night in Burj Al Arab. It was 24 hours of the best of service and comfort from start to end. We loved our Palm view suite, the view, comfortable furnitures, the bed, the jacuzzi our butler service the food and locations in the hotel, inside and outside. Wonderful pool areas also with jacuzzi and great lounge areas. We were absolutely feeling we were living in a fairytale.Great experience, we will return next time in Dubai. Thank you Ashraf (butler), Nagor and Abbas (pool service) for making our stay so exceptional.   ","5","2023-02"
"Lovely Day with Lovely Peoples","What a beautiful property with lovely people! The vibe, the views, everything feels and looks top notch. We had a Cabana for a day and it was beautifully spacious. All staff members were incredibly attentive and kind Especially Nitesh and Sofia in the restaurant, we felt most welcomed by flowers and Special Dessert Povolove and all our requests were attended with the best effort. This is the only place in Dubai I always want to come back to. The restaurant has the best atmosphere, the food is very fantastic as well but the vibe is the thing that makes me want to come back.

Thank you so much Nitesh and Sofia and all Team of Sal.

"Bucket list stay ! Wonderful","We have always wanted to stay at this hotel and so as it was a special birthday we decided to take the plunge and stay for a couple of nights .. we were really glad that we did. 

Our room was truly huge in every sense of the word .. all 2 storeys of it … decorated specially with birthday balloons which was a lovely surprise. 

The service from all staff was excellent - but especially the butlers bringing drinks to our room during happy hour (s).

Breakfast was honestly amazing … absolutely top quality and everything that you could possibly think of. 

Cocktails at the sky bar were amazing !!! 

We had a special meal in one of the hotels restaurants - al mahara and it was amazing. Could not be faulted. 

If we had to be really picky .. .. we would say that the rooms are ready for a refurb. And there were times by the pool when the hotel allowed guests on day passes over the weekend and this created a totally different atmosphere … one which at times was quite noisy, rude and brash…  

That being said we would stay again in a heartbeat if we were ever able to. It felt like a once in a lifetime experience …","5","2022-09"
"Amazing Spa Experience","I have traveled all over the world and this spa experience by far was the best I have ever had.  The facilities are absolutely magnificient, the service from the locker room attendants was over the top (especially Bhairav) and the treament I had with Rothea was spectacular.  I cannot say enough positive things about this spa and I would highly recommend - do not miss it!","5","2023-02"
"Truly worlds only 7 star hotel","There can never be another Burj Al Arab. This hotel is definitely higher than a typical 5 star hotel. You cannot compare it with another 5 star hotel. Me and my family stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in delix marina suit. All the rooms are duplex. They have a lounge just outside the airport from where they can arrange a transfer. As soon as u enter this hotel, you are treated like a royalty. There’s a private butler for u who is like your one point of contact. Room is just amazing. The infrastructure of Burj Al Arab is one of its kind and its a must must visit if you are in Dubai . You can always spot a celebrity or a billionaire at this hotel. I was having a lunch in one of their restaurant and Mr Ambani ( Indians richest person) was sitting on a table next to us. All the toiletries are from brand Hermes. They provide Body lotion, after shave jel, Mens perfume, women perfume, body gel , shower, conditioner from Hermes brand which was really amazing.
Private beach is really beautiful with a nice lounge. Sun beds are very good and cart is always available for pick and drop off. 

The only thing which is unreasonable is security deposit. Security deposit is almost like 1500 dirham per person per night. Also, in room dinning is also exceptionally expensive. Cheapest dish from the menu was like for 100 dhiram .","5","2022-10"
"Wonderful staff/service ","The room was fantastic along with the views... The bed was super comfortable with premium bedding... The staff without exception were helpful and polite
The beach bar along with the infinity pool was spectacular, lovely vibe without music being too loud... The lady and the Gentleman who were playing the piano in the atrium were 1st class ..The spa was fantastic- great sitting in the jacuzzi with the stunning views 
I will 100% be back there","5","2023-02"
"Burj Al Arab it is - Excellent","It was my birthday week, so I travelled to the UAE. I want to experience the local culture and eat Middle Eastern food, therefore I headed to the Sky View Bar before having iftar at the Al Iwan Restaurant. Jagruti at Al Iwan offered excellent service. I can't remember their names, but the staff at the sky view bar gave excellent service. I stayed at the Al Maha Luxury Collection and the Taj Jumeriah Dubai Marina. I wanted to have dinner and drinks at the Burj Al Arab. When I go back to Dubai, I'll stay in the Burj Al Arab.","5","2022-04"

very wonderful seafood restaurant.
it really was an amazing experience","5","2023-02"
"Mind-blowing!","There's not much to say shy of this place was amazing! I was absolutely blown away by the level of service! Everyone was so friendly and showered us with hospitality the second the doorman opened the door to our car. Each and every person we came into contact with went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed. Pedro escorted us to our room upon check in and was very helpful. Omar, our butler was always present to greet us with a smile and was available to answer our questions. Eric, at Sal, took great care of me all day. Matthew, at Sal, kept my parents happy while they sipped cocktails and watched the boats go by. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was way too short, I truly hope to be back soon!","5","2023-02"

"Actually great","We booked the BAA ""for kicks"" as it is so over the top we thought it would be a can't miss life experience. 

The reality of staying there was great. The rooms are huge and spotless and the service is bar none perfect. We were most impressed with our floor butlers who made the experience really special. 

Breakfast in the hotel restaurant is 10/10.

"Best in the World","Having stayed at hotels all over the world, the Burj Al Arab is the absolute best hotel experience we have ever had. I must admit it is very expensive but if you can afford it, I do not think you will be disappointed. Every single staff member went out of their way to make sure our every whim was taken care of. From the moment we drove up to be greeted by the valet until we left the hotel, the customer service was extraordinary. It truly is an icon. They treat you like royalty. What a wonderful experience. We only had a light lunch and a light dinner at the hotel but what we had was delicious. ","5","2023-02"
"Mr. NURMANBET is the best!","Mr. NURMANBET is the best room service butler ever. He was very professional, attentive, and gave a 7-star service that is unmatched with other hotels. He deserves to be recognized and should be promoted ASAP! He was one of the best staff members. ","5","2022-03"

"Bucket list hotel that will now be our Dubai hotel","Big birthday this year so thought we would treat ourselves. The problem now is that when we come for our annual trip to Dubai we don’t want to stay anywhere else

The staff are all great so friendly and helpful

The room is sensational. We were booked in marina view which is looking at the half built hotel so we asked to be moved which was done

Breakfast was great

We did use the pool facilities at the burj once and then used exec pool at JBH which we are familiar with and suited us better

We had an issue with the bastion restaurant at JBH but the staff at burj attended to this for us

Already booked flights for next January just need to book the burj 😂","5","2023-02"
"The Butler who found the missing phone","Great hotel.  Fabulous decor and very friendly staff.   I happened to misplace my phone while at the hotel and was frantically searching for six hours. I want to give special thanks to our butler Sanjay (16th floor) who with the skill of Sherlock Holmes asked a few questions and made a few observations and in five minutes located the phone!","5","2023-02"
"Afternoon Tea experience ","I had afternoon tea at Sahn Eddar, which was great, but the highlight of my trip was the doormen! Achol and Samuel were great about trying to get me a taxi when it was time to leave, and we chatted a bit while waiting. Achol is one of the nicest guys, and he gave me some great information for my trip in Dubai. I really appreciated their friendliness! ","5","2023-01"
"Was appalling","Service was pretty standard. The ""standard"" room are all ""Presidential Suite"" but things I don't think has been updated or upgraded at all since. 
Food was bad had a salmon egg Benedict it was taste and disgusting. A local cafe call Brunch & Cake do way better then them. Didn't even bother trying their other restaurants.

"Heaven on Earth","We celebrated our wedding anniversary at The Burj Al Arab - that was indeed the best and memorable experience.. we felt like 'we landed on heaven'... Highly recommending. Starting from call from hotel to take note of our requirements prior to arrival, personalized greetings at reception, tour, service staff smiling everywhere, artwork more than our eyes and camera can capture, mouth watering food selection - served with utmost care for cleanliness and presentation, best trained hospitability staff, Jacuzzi for ultimate bubble bath, inifite pool merged with beach for nirvana state, indoor pool - that can take you centuries back royal treatment, kids play areas.. Well.. we enjoyed throughly.. looking forward for the next anniversary celebrations at Burj al arab - well kids demand now for their birthdays too... :)","5","2023-01"
"We were completely blown away!!","I have stayed in some amazing properties, including the Reagan Suite at Ashford Castle in Ireland, and I stay at Ritz-Carltons all over the world.   This was by far the best hotel experience I have ever had.

Every room in the hotel is on two levels, and our room (we were in a Panoramic Suite) made us feel like royalty, but what really made our stay the most incredible every way was our floor Butler Aimie.   

She went above and beyond in every way to make us feel so special.   My wife was pregnant, and there were surprises in the room on two different nights to celebrate the pregnancy.   The thing that blew me away the most however was that we had commented how we'd love to see Hans Zimmer in concert (He was performing that night in Dubai), and she surprised us with 2 VIP tickets on the floor of the Coca Cola Arena.   My wife was in tears of gratitude.   I am still blown away by that.  Also, my wife is Peruvian, and the most famous Chef from Peru was having the opening night to the restaurant at the Royal Atlantas hotel which wasn't open to the public until another few weeks.   I had called the restaurant, but they told me I couldn't book until that time.  But Aimie got us a reservation somehow.   It was a magical night for my wife to be there on the opening.   It was all part of an incredible experience that wouldn't have happened without our butler and the hotel.   

I could go on and on about how her and the rest of the staff treated us.  The valet knew our names, Other individuals from the floor butlers such as Gladys, Emmanuel and others were super nice.   I will come back to this hotel in a heartbeat!","5","2023-01"
"Best stay EVER !","We stayed with my husband and my 18 months old baby for 1 week. The staff were amazing, they always did their best to respond to our requests as quickly and as well as possible,  installed a protective barrier on the stairs, they were giving a small gift everyday on the bed, and were also coming everyday with a small car full of gifts for the kids. A special thanks to Ibrahim the butler on our floor who was exceptional and very professional towards us, he made sure that we lacked nothing, and always took the time to greet us and play with our kid even when he wasn’t working on our floor.
Also, the food was excellent, especially the breakfast. A large choice of food.

We’ll come back for sure !","5","2023-01"
"Stay @ burj","Nice guys and try to do there best. For experience as they claim te be its not that exclusive. Staff take you as a visitor/ explorer then a guest of the hotel. Also not totaly baby friendly. Sky lounge can not be accessed with a baby. ","2","2023-01"

After picking our sunbed we were looked after by Flevin Antony & for the full day he was first class. He seemed to just always there when we where ready toorder. We were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. Not just ad day trippers.   Thankyou for a great experience. & thankyou afain. To Flevin.  ( he is a first class member of your staff. )","5","2023-01"
"Enjoyed our stay but perhaps a little disappointed!"," We Stayed at the Burj for 5 nights in November following an amazing and absolutely faultless 9 night stay at Dar Al Masyaf. 

We have visited Dubai annually for over 20 years and stayed at many lovely properties but this was our first stay at the Burj Al Arab despite  having visited the hotel to eat in the restaurants many times. 

My expectations were obviously high as this hotel sells itself on its 7 star reputation. 

Overall we enjoyed our stay but we did feel some of the staff were a little impersonal compared to our previous experiences in Dubai. 

We did experience great service from the staff in the SkyView bar and also Gilt bar.
 Sardor made feel very welcome in the breakfast restaurant and also Sachin looked after us well by the pool. 

I swam in the ladies indoor pool at the spa. The views were amazing and I had the place to myself. 

We stayed in  Suite 1203. The suite was amazing and lived up to my expectations. 
We did experience some technical issues in our suite which went on for the first 2 - 3 days. These were attended to but took some time to sort out which meant several visits and disturbances from the technicians. 
We were compensated for the inconvenience with a bottle of champagne from Omar our Butler on the first evening of our stay and then later a gift of a candle from the general manager. 
We had a lovely and friendly daytime  Butler  called Lilian and  also on our first evening , Omar our evening Butler was also very helpful. Unfortunately the butler we had for our  last 4 evenings ( we didn’t catch his name) we found very difficult to connect with for  some reason. Often unfriendly and dismissive. I have never experienced a personality issue like this with a Butler before within high end hotels in Dubai . We found this disappointing. 

My general feeling was that this hotel does have many visitors who are not staying at the hotel, within the both general areas and also by the pool. The hotel is obviously a tourist attraction and hence it obviously does attracts tourists. 

We stayed 5 nights,  I may be wrong  , but I did have a feeling that generally most people stay for fewer. If this is the case , perhaps  this and the many outside visitors could explain the air of impersonalism  that I observed from some of the staff? 

Overall a good time was had but unfortunately my expectations were not quite reached hence leaving me feeling a little disappointed as opposed to the excellent, personal and friendly service we experienced at Dar Al Masyaf on the first part of the trip.

"Burj Al Arab - 💎🙌","5 out of 5 spa experience. The facilities at the spa are impeccable and the treatments are best in class.

In the men’s locker room they have a cold plunge, steam room and sauna (nice rotation pre-treatment). The steam room and sauna have basically floor to ceiling windows in them so you can look out over the gulf. Same thing for the pool rooms. My massage experience was fantastic with very kind employees. Ginger tea and dates in a relaxation room post-treatment was a nice touch as well.","5","2023-01"
"Interesting insight of a very expensive stay","This was a tour which was to take you inside the hotel and show you how it was built and how it is run today - you arrive at the JEMERIA BEACH HOTEL and you go to the ticket centre from their y are taken in an electric cart to the hotel on arrival you are presented with a soft drink and a cold towel and then taken up to the top of the hotel  - great views interesting decor but all about 30 years old and what y see now is really a museum - pity y don’t see the actual rooms that are in use the tour ended with a cocktail in the outside bar - you can take photos but it is a well oiled tour and well thought out","4","2023-01"
"Best hotel in the world","My experience staying at the Burj Al Arab Hotel was the best stay in my entire life and international travels.
I have never had such an impeccable reception, personalized and full of memories that will forever be kept in my heart. Without a doubt, the Burj Al Arab is for me the best hotel in the world.
I have nothing but praise for the entire Burj Al Arab family and I want to highlight some of your team members who made all the difference to make everything very special.
I took this trip with my sister, who was also impressed with all the exclusivity and care we were treated.
I want to say a huge thank you to the guest relations manager, Mr. Vincenzo de Liso, who received us at the hotel door, explained everything to us and even made several kindnesses so that we could have a late check out.
I also need to thank our driver Mujiba, who picked us up at Porto Marina Dubai and was very friendly on the way. We had a lot of laughs with him.
Then we met our concierge Saida, who was always available, concerned about assisting us and helping with whatever was needed. She made us feel at home and was always very friendly and polite.
I loved meeting the breakfast waitress, Miss Masha, and at our two breakfasts, she was extremely attentive and very polite, noticing things she liked to eat and bringing them to us without asking. She was very smiley and graceful.
I would also like to thank Mr. Sachin, from the pool, who always served us with great joy and smiles.
Anyway, I only have praise, gratitude and that I can return at a next opportunity, as it was the most unforgettable hotel experience I've had to date.
Thank you soo much!! I love everything!!
Yours sincerely!!

"Top Luxurious Stay in Dubai, Burj Al Arab!","We stayed at this beautiful property for my 40th birthday with my family. 
It was one of the best experience, starting from my Rolls Royce Phantom Hotel pickup, warm meet and greet,  easy check-in, two story room, Christmas gifts for the kids arriving in in-house RollsRoyce Jumeriah cart, I was welcomed with multiple cakes and bakery items for my birthday. We had the best view onlooking the city on one side and Atlantis on the other, all toiletries from Hermes, excellent room service and food choices for in room dining. The SAL restaurant was so refreshing, At the Ristorante L' Olivo at Al Mahara we had the best food and drink experience with beautiful and super clean aquarium. The lobby had the biggest Christmas tree decoration, it was so grand. The Burj tour for the guests is free and worth it. The whole experience cannot be written in words. We fell in in love with Jumeriah. Keep it up! We will see you guys again in the near future.  <3","5","2022-12"
"My Experience at Burj Al Arab Hotel","I recently stayed at the Burj Al Arab hotel and was unfortunately slightly disappointed with my experience. The hotel appears to be aging and the rooms, while spacious, were not worth the seven star ranking they boast. The decor was outdated and not nearly as luxurious as other top hotels I have stayed in. The staff were friendly and the views were great, but overall I felt the hotel did not live up to its seven star reputation.","4","2022-08"

"THE MOST LUXURIOUS HUMILIATION","Honestly! Have you ever wondered why a double room in Four seasons is more expensive than a two storey luxurious, richly furnished app in Burj al Arab? The answer is simple- management! On the 7 Dec, after our fantastic stay in Emirates palace we wanted to show our kids the BA as we stayed here once in 2007. Great expectation we had but no! Our kids are aged 13 and 8 on the day of check-in. We had a prepaid voucher, saying our daughter was 12. What a huge problem! So it started! You cannot even imagine what is humiliating, fake empathy and rudeness. According to their own rules from the site kids are concidered kids 0-11,99. This definitely means kids 12+ are adults. So, being 12,13, 14 doesn’t change anything. There started the pushing to pay 1500 EUR additionally. Not to mention the amount we had already paid. What are their contracts with agencies and how much they get is non of my business too. They also told if it was a booking from the site then no problem at all!?! We refused to pay since it was quite unfair. They kept us 3 hours in the lobby and didn’t let us in the room! Until they pushed us to pay! We told them that we will have to change clothes for dinner in the lobby if they don’t accommodate us. Of course joking!! A guy with glasses came to tell us that we can only do this in the toilet. Even with glasses he couldn’t see that he has nothing to do in the hospitality business.  All the reception staff working in the afternoon was really unwelcoming, led by the front office Joleen. Almost most of the stuff didn’t wear their name badges, probably in the “Most luxurious hotel” the staff is even more luxurious…Not to mention that the day before we leave I cut my leg in the outside jacuzzi and I had a glass which the pool staff helped me take out and put a bandage. Should I go and cry for compensations? I wouldn’t act so low as they did. Even though nobody asked me anything later, so careless!

The good staff - the breakfast is fantastic, staff there are the most kind people in this hotel.Every day we had lunch in SAL, also very good.
All in all the reception ruined the otherwise good feeling from the place, for nothing! I have to join some of the other reviews and say that there are really fantastic hotels and service in Dubai, but not here. Also, the only person who acted normally and felt really sorry for this stupid situation was Mr Varaul Bhatia. Thank you.","1","2023-01"

"Bad service and bad information...","Before I made the reservation, I was in contact BAA Guest relations to get a confirmation regarding the Helipad photo session. You were not able to confirm even if it was 2 days before if it was possible until I have made the reservation. That is quite bad service. However I made the reservation and when it’s made you inform me that kids under 12 are not allowed.. The ONLY reason why I booked it to make the Helipad photo. I ask if I can change the reservation but to Madinat which is the same Company but with recline. Have in mind that this is just a couple of hours before I made the reservation. It's really bad, that you didn't inform me before me before I made the reservation and that I was not able to cancel. I do understand that If I had canceled the whole booking for another hotel that could had been a reason but not now. Furthermore, I have seen picture when younger kids are on the Helipad.

As Jumeirah One Platinum member you are entitled to late check out if availability and transfer. If I book with my Amex Centurion you are guaranteed late check out. I asked for late check out and didn't receive that until 9 am the departure day, and I had to change room. If I had booked by Amex I had got late check out in the same room. I was also rejected transfer to the airport, because it says in the 20 pages of terms that I have to book 4 nights. This has NEVER happened to my when I stayed at Dar Al Masyaf. I think its rude to send over the Terms and for your information. I stayed at DAM 2 nights after this stay and the offered me without asking transfer. That Amazing service.
I can not recommend to anyone to stay at the Burj al Arab after this.

The experience was amazing: comfort of the bed, space of the room, complimentary Bvlgari lotion and cream, the restaurants, the infinity pool next to the ocean, but the Butler just makes this hotel out of this world. Thank you Yoon! 
Every space, service and experience though to the detail, exceeded expectations. Although it is expensive, worth every dollar. 
All the staff was exceptional, but my deepest thanks to Nagur at the pool (Sal); his kindness and service has been the best experience in my wife’s and my life. Never felt more cared for.

"Amazing experience! You haven’t been to dubai  until you have stayed at the burj","Amazing experience! You haven’t been to dubai until you have stayed at the burj.
New Year’s Eve was a great unforgettable experience. When we arrived to our room the size and layout of the room was amazing unlike any other hotel I have stayed.
When I arrived the buttler unpacked
And folded my clothes placing them in the cubboard, really made our stay comfortable and special. Worth every $ ","5","2022-12"
"Expected more from a so called 7star property","I stayed with my wife and kid at this property, checked in on 29th Dec, room number #1411
 I had booked hotel pickup by rolls royce from Armani to burj al arab . The condition of car was in not in very good condition, was disappointed.  Check in was average not very welcoming.  We were escorted to our room. The view from the room was excellent.  Thanks to EGA for attending us nicely.
We had booked half board. The restaurant manager of AL iwan was not aware of our booked meal . We were told to wait ,while they enquired. The food options were very limited as we are vegetarians,the chef also could help much. This was disappointing, but I didn't expect the same at breakfast next day but here also apart from paratha and idli nothing much was available.  
The check out was very dry,where printer in a 7 star hotel was not working.  I felt ignored while leaving from the hotel although I had booked a hotel drop to the airport. ","4","2022-12"
"❤️❤️","Thank you Mr Ali Khan for arranging for me a small tour to the 7-star Burj Al Arab hotel, the golden resort icon of Dubai.  The tour was very interesting, the staff was very enthusiastic, the hotel was luxurious and beautiful and we had a time to experience the space and enjoy cocktails at the hotel bar.  Thanks for Mr Ali Khan's enthusiasm to help me enjoy my trip, I really like Burj Al Arab and Dubai","5","2023-01"
"Sachin made our day!","Spent the day here and loved it. Great views and food, not too expensive when compared to other beach clubs. Sachin made our day, he was so welcoming, personalised and attentive to us and everyone around us.","5","2023-01"
"Excellent","I have a wonderful stay. All services are excellent. Food are nice. The ground staff response are quick and well respond. The staffs are friendly, sincere and helpful. The security are doing well performed. Thanks. ","5","2022-12"
"Once in a lifetime","Stunning property. Everything I thought I would find in a hotel of this caliber. However, service was a little under par. Supposedly 24 hour Butler service but never saw anybody at the desk. Breakfast was very good. The spa area is incredible. I’m glad I was able to see this property in person. The accommodations themselves top notch. The bath products are Hermes.","4","2022-05"
"The Worlds 7 star hotel lives up to its name","A truly wonderful experience had by my clients and I provided the perfect location to combine business and pleasure

The hotel was ideally located so that I was able to provide my clients with a Dubai Property Tour

I would highly recommend to others to experience this amazing hotel ","5","2022-10"
"Sadly, Never again !","This review is being written 4 weeks after we returned from our trip to Dubai and our stay at the Bur Al Arab.
We have stayed at this once amazing hotel many times, and this would have been our 3rd visit in 12 months.
A year ago, we witnessed some of the worst behaviour we have ever seen from a senior member of the hotel staff and experienced some shocking services levels from a hotel which should be the best of the best. 
After that shocking episode we vowed never to return, however, I received a personal call from Mr Zanini who at the time was Regional VP & General Manager who wanted to hear about our experience. He reassured me that he would take onboard my comments and put in corrective measures, he also invited us back so the Burk Al Arab can could demonstrate the positive changes that Mr Zanini had driven. 
Against my original decision not to return, we decided to give the Burj a 2nd chance. And our visit in March was perfect in terms of the changes that had been delivered, thank you Mr Zanini. 
In Nov 2022 we decided to stay at the Burj again this time for a week. On arrival we discovered that Mr Giovanni Beretta had replaced Mr. Zanini who now is in another role. 
The suite we were allocated was extremely run done and felt old. And on arrival the shower head needed changing, and the hotel staff had to try and eliminate a drainage smell. So, we headed out and on our return that evening, the smell had gone, and the shower head had been replaced. 
The remainder of the week was very pleasant, and the butler service we received from Lillian was world class and deserves recognizing, she is a super star in the making, we also were looked after by the wonder kid Omar who, as always went out of his way to make our stay wonderful. The butler standards have been set by the likes of Omar and Sanjay, and if you are looking for a benchmark for the best of the best in terms of butlers, then Omar & Sanjay should be the levels you should aim for, Lillian as mentioned was and will be a standard bearer. 
The guys on the North Deck, Nitesh, TJ and rest of the team are a pleasure to be around and will always go and above. Dinner at Shimmers was an experience that we will never forget a top draw restaurant run by a wonderful General Manager. And as always Tiago was so helpful and welcomed us warmly to his new bar. 
After what had been a relatively decent stay, the hidden faces of the Burj Al Arab decided to ruin our whole trip for a 2nd time in 12 months. There was some confusion regarding an email sent to me by a member of the front desk, a matter which should have been resolved in a matter of minutes. Instead for over 2 hours I was harassed and being treated like someone who had lied. It was shocking and has totally ruined another holiday. A stay at the Burj should be relaxing and enjoyable, instead you upset us, and stressed us out. I want to though heap praise on to Nabi, she was thrown under the bus by the Duty Manager Varoul, and the Front Desk Manager Daniel. Nabi is a very classy and intelligent young lady who is a credit to the Burj and brings huge value add to the business and is someone who should be rewarded and recognized. A truly wonderful person. However, she was ill advised and miss managed, she knew what the right thing was to do, but was sent up by the faceless cowards to try and fob me off.  

Let me tell you Mr. Beretta Varoul and Daniel came to my suite ill informed and not prepared, they failed to apply common sense to the issue, instead were keen on following policy and made me feel as I had lied. Not good enough. 
Daniel since the incident has reach out, I think he gets my point in term of how you should manage people and issues, I also informed him that people like Nabi should have a voice, and not be puppets who have there strings pulled by faceless people. 
I have been told Mr. Beretta that you are always keen on hearing about customer experiences, and if that is the case, I invite you to call me, as I do have some very constructive feedback for you. 
Sadly, we will never return to the Burj again, a hotel that claims to be the best should never ruin 2 visits on 12 months. You might expect that in a budget hotel but not at the Burj.","1","2022-11"
"Amazing experience !","The staff was amazing and always smiling and efficient. The suite with the best view ever. 
Food was delicious, everything clean and luxurious, we had an amazing 4 days we felt pampered and special all in a very confortable and exclusive environment. ","5","2022-12"
"PERFECTION: 7 Star Hotel !","A Dream come true!
The hotel entrance and lobby is just out of this world. The colors, the lightning, the dancing fountains and the aquariums on the bots sides of the escalators are incredible! 
Every small detail is beyond luxury. The staff is very attentive and comprehensive.
Suites are very clean and comfortable
Try the 24 gold carat coffee. It is a must!
I recommend Al Muntaha restaurant at sunset and Sal beach club. 
Both are inside Burj Al Arab.

It is a must on your life bucket list!
AMAZING!

","5","2022-12"
"The best hotel to stay","Great service and environment. Nice pool for family. Nice breakfast. Cannot forget this experience! Room is really big with nice sea view and Khalifa is in your picture. Worth the money you pay. Will back next time","5","2022-12"
"beyond 7 stars","I am told this is the only 7 star hotel in the world. I now can see why. This hotel is absolutely incredible. To the very smallest detail it is beyond luxury. It should be on everyone's bucket list. YES, it's that good.
Even the hotel employees were a cut above. There was a valet named Achol that was so amazing I had to make mention of him.
he took the time to engage with us everytime he saw us. He remembered our names and always went the extra mile to make our stay superior. You just don't find people like Achol everyday. BRAVO to the Burj!!! I can't stop talking about our stay.","5","2022-11"
"DON´T WASTE MONEY IN THIS HOTEL SCAM! THIEFS!","in hell i'm sure they got better deal than this hotel. We wanted to go to Al Iwan restaurant for dinner and we tried to make the payment in advance. 5 times the card was rejected. They contacted us by email after several days and told us to pay directly in cash upon arrival. To our surprise, the 5 payments had made an impact and they were unaware of the payment. We had to show them the card statements to get them to accept it. After several hours of fighting, they recognized the mistake and apologized. Mrs. Patsy Travis was going to receive us, but for an unknown reason she did not want to or could not receive us. Another manager called ANUSHIKA or something like that attended us. She promised to give us an immediate solution and that she would manage the refund on the first business day. 10 days have passed and we are still waiting.
A total shame. We thought that the supposedly best hotel in the world was going to have good customer service. Unfortunately not! don't waste your time going to the place of these thieves, there are MUCH better things to do in DUBAI!!!","1","2022-12"
"Best hotel in Dubai","Absolutely amazing hotel. Nothing to complain! Best and #1 in Dubai. Rooms are so clean and everything is in the best condition. I do really recommend this hotel for the stay or even as an experience. You get brilliant service and too specious rooms. Just one thing I didn’t like, please check the stairs in the suite, the second or third step has a sound. It looks like it’s damaged and you need to fix it. It was a bit annoying when I used the stairs because I of the sound.","5","2022-12"
"Only 1 Night Stay But Unforgettable","Amazingly beautiful hotel and service in all respects outstandingly fabulous, I would love to return with my husband - stayed with my 2 teenage boys and although quite fabulous the opulence of the hotel was lost on them - typical boys just wanted to be outside swimming and participating in water-sports, a very special hotel and will return in the future","5","2022-04"
"Highly recommended!","Spent a week at the Burj. From our arrival to our departure, we had a great experience & service. In particular, Anthony at the pool was a star. We ate breakfast at Bab Al Yam, had drinks at the Skyview Bar & dinner at various locations. Great team - thanks to all. ","5","2022-12"
"Burj Al Arab","Absolutely a must to see, such a beautifully stunning structure inside and out. No trip can be complete without the Burj Al Arab. The staff are so welcoming, helpful, efficient and professional especially the amazing team at the Welcome Centre, special thanks to Umar and his colleagues. Umar was very helpful, polite and such a gentleman. Thank you for making my visit memorable.","5","2022-12"
"Heaven","We stayed there for a night during our 15th anniversary. Overall the property is excellent, good interiors and exteriors and good hospitality. The suite we stayed in was marvellous. I forgot the name but we had a very good butler assigned to us.","5","2022-11"
"Bad experience","My husband and I went for a couples massage and it was a nightmare from start to end. From making a reservation to the actual massage ( which was stop start for the entire 90 minutes massage).  And it wasn’t cheap either! I will not go there again !","1","2022-12"
"Over the Top!","The Burj al Arab, I must say, is the most iconic hotel l've ever stayed at, providing service and amenities that's just beyond comparison. I've stayed at other great hotels in the past, i.e., Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, St Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Aman Resort, and others. In fact, I was at the Armani hotel near Dubai Mall before moving to the Burj.
While these hotels are also great in their own way, the Burj is just over the top and a notch above the rest!

I would also recommend taking the tour of the Burj, especially the tour of the Royal Suite!

Just a shout... thank you, Eddie! I really enjoyed the personalized tour! You are an awesome tour guide!

A truly memorable stay!

PS I liked the buggy rides that take guests all around the Jumeirah complex!","5","2022-12"
"World's best hotel","We recently spend 4 nights at the Burj Al Arab hotel and absolutely loved it. I have stayed at the best hotels across the world and in my view, the Burj was the best. Service was out of this world, room phenomenal, the restaurants (we tried 4 different restaurants in the hotel) outstanding, everything was absolutely first class and justifies the 7-star ranking the hotel has.","5","2022-11"
"Beautiful and awesome hotel but we do not felt welcome","Booked a 2 bedroom suite for our last night to close out our amazing middle Eastern trip - Joran (Petra, Dead Sea), Qatar (2 world cup games), and Dubai.

The hotel is amazing but we never felt welcome.  We are constantly been asked by the hotel staff to confirm if we were staying in the hotel when we want to use the facilities.  

Apparently, we do not fit into the profiles.  Perhaps a little sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion will make all the difference.","2","2022-11"
"Visit to Burj Al Arab spa","Bhairav welcomed my wife and myself. He was very helpful and provided exceptional service with a smile. I felt very much at ease and because of him, I can say we had a great time using the Spa facilities. 
Bhairav is a real asset to the Burj Al Arab.","5","2022-11"
"A Landmark","Wow, Burj Al Arab: expectations are very high when you book this place...
You will be disappointed if you're expecting the best hotel in the world.
However, it is a truly fine place, and highly recommend for your bucket list! The palatial design and the fine decor are extraordinary, the rooms super specious and absolutely stunning and the cuisine exquisite.
But it is a museum. It showcases a new area of hospitality, first introduced by this very hotel more than 20 years ago. So, some things may seem very outdated, and there will be quite some touristy activities.
Still, the beach club is chic, the spa is good and has great views, the breakfast is fresh and nice, but not excessive.
The amenities are superb (Hermès), and you will find an abundance of extras during your visit.
So: Book Burj Al Arab and enjoy your stay in this beautiful and truly unique landmark!","5","2022-02"
"AMAZING SERVICE AT TALISE SPA POOL","Bhairav and Rochelle service was spot on! Right when you enter they will come and greet you and be on your service whenever you need anything. Bhairav was very kind he was there to wave good bye when we left. Amazing Staff amazing service! Well done Bhairav! Till we meet again!","5","2022-11"
"WE LOVE YOU SAL","Nitesh is an absolute star. He made me and my friend's birthday so special! He is so attentive and had amazing energy. He arranged flowers and a dessert platter for my friends birthday & it really made our day. The beach club is chilled, sophisticated & calming. SAL is by far the best beach club i have been to in Dubai and i have been to many. Love love love! Thank you SAL! ","5","2022-11"
"SAL Beach Club - WOW","SAL Beach club was wonderful.  Flavin Anthony looked after us all day.  Amazing value for money and a fabulous resort.  The best of everything and then some.  Beautiful facilities so clean and so convenient.  Stunning view of an amazing hotel and the out to the sea.  Great food and drinks wonderful coffee.  Will be back for sure!","5","2022-11"
"Inside Burj Al Arab- Not to be missed","Finally those who can’t find a booking for a 7000AED night stay at Burj Al Arab can enjoy their visit at this beautiful hotel by booking “Inside Burj Al Arab” experience from their website for 250AED. Entry to this visit is not from Original Burj Al Arab hotel gate but from Jumeirah Beach Hotel where they have own building for this experience .

On the way to hotel you stop on bridge to take photo of iconic monument. Once enter they give you brief background of hotel and take you on tour. They give you enough opportunities to take photographs and make your visit memorable. As a part of visit they take you to 25th floor where they have converted suits to museum. Each suits are of two floors so technically you are on 50th floor.
Enjoy your coffee with dates while you sit and enjoy breathtaking view.
Price for this experience is set at 250AED, make sure that you check their website for any promotional offer, I got 25% discount for booking through VISA card. you may find people saying if that’s worth ? but based on my experience it’s worth every penny.","5","2022-11"
"Daniel Smitsdorp","I was on a Diwali Vacation to Explore Abu Dhabi & Dubai. On 30th Oct 2022, We had a scheduled Day Trip Inside Burj Al Arab. We all were very excited to see the Ultimate Luxury, Ambience, Architect. Unfortunately, when you don't expect Life throws upon you some surprises. We went on the 25th Floor (Technically 50th Floor) just then my shoes broke and i was unable to walk. I requested rest of my family to carry on and do not spoil the mood. Worst happened when i was walking back the lobby my foot sole got separated. 

There was nobody, but when i said ""Anyone There""???  A young dynamic, smiling face approached me, he was Mr. Daniel Smitsdorp, Yes Miss?? and he saw my broken shoe he immediately picked up my shoe sole, i will throw in the dustbin, don't worry. He immediately understood my situation & gave me an option if i would like to purchase from the store a room slippers... quite costly...

Mr. Daniel Smitsdorp as a finest gentleman, he took me to a staff elevator tried to talk with me to ease my mood dropped me to the location where the golf cars would take us back to the starting point.

I owe a big ""Thank You"" -  to Mr. Daniel Smitsdorp. When i reached the starting point two people asked hey Miss are you alone or with the group and i explained what happened and told about how Mr. Daniel Smitsdorp helped me, from them i came to know that he is from South Africa!!! Sometimes Destiny works the way we can't understand... I said my mother was born in South Africa - Pretoria. So, an Angel from SA - Mr. Daniel Smitsdorp.","5","2022-10"
"Mixed Feelings....","We travelled here last minute whilst on holiday in Ras Al Khaimah from the UK.
Our booking was done via American Express for one night on 25th October with our two children age one and five. The benefits of booking via AMEX are competitive rates with best available room upgrade and late 4pm check out guarantee.
We booked a Duplex Suite with Palm view and also the Rolls Royce chauffeur service which was approx. £600 from our hotel in Ras Al Khaimah.
We were promptly collected by our driver Samir, a wonderful man who made our journey comfortable to the Burj. 
On arrival, again we were promptly greeted outside and taken in to the check in area where our children were made comfortable with soft toys and we were given cold coffee and dates.
 We were shown to our room and the wonderful butler Anthony had personally done a personalised display of photographs, chocolate cake, canapés, flowers, fruits and personalised named Burj Al Arab soft toys for our two children. Naturally, I was taken back as such level of thought and it brought a tear to my eye. Anthony is the most amazing butler you will experience and is always on top of our list of wonderful travel memories. In fairness, we booked this hotel knowing Anthony would provide a flawless service.
We were introduced to our butler Fateh who was equally lovely and was able to give us a detailed insight into the hotel and arranged a tour before we headed out to Wild Wadi.
During our check in process, we did question our host to ensure we had the best available room as per AMEX benefits and she assured us it was. We were disappointed to see we had interrupted views from our room – it was the building structure.
The hotel tour was lovely and was hosted by some great people. There was a horrendous sewage smell outside the Royal Suite (people should be warned about). The Royal Suite is now a museum and you wonder why???
As we headed out, we receive a call from a member of staff advising they would not honour a 4pm check out and if we wanted this it would be an additional amount of approx £6000!!!! Its a lot of money to demand last minute.
There was also a lot of confusion around the booking as the hotel thought we booked it directly however despite provide the paperwork from AMEX highlighting the additional benefits, this member of staff consistently insisted it was incorrect. We were at this hotel for approx. 24 hours and 80% of our time was used in trying to clear this confusion and it felt stressful. 
This female member of staff caused our stay to be quite stressful instead of taking ownership to help resolve the matter, this is supposed to be the ‘most’ luxurious hotel in the world but sadly for our stay it was the most stressful.
As a result of the stress, we had to cancel our restaurant booking for Ristorante L’Olivio which was we were looking forward to but we did make it to the Sky Lounge which was nice. We had the opportunity to hire inhouse sitter (forgotten her name) and she was absolutely amazing.
As we checked out, we were approached by the Assistant Front Office Manager Nicole who apologised for the confusion but sadly it was  late given we were checking out.  Nicole has since reached out extending her apology and they look forward to welcoming us back.
On the plus, the rooms were lovely (abit dated) and comfortable and breakfast and poolside service was good too.","3","2022-10"
"An amazing experience","I stayed at burj al Arab the stay was amazing and wonderful, our butler Fathy he was amazing he provide an amazing service with his fantastic smile he don’t give you chance to desire anything he always prepared it in advance. Great service Fathy will miss you 😘","5","2022-11"
"The hotel is unfortunately dated and needs some renovation","The service, staff and food was excellent.  But the rooms and furniture were dated.. and the spa facilities left much to be desired.  For the price per night, not worth staying here unfortunately.  There are much better quality hotels in Dubai for a more reasonable price.  ","3","2022-11"
"Most stunning hotel","Fantastic hotel. Attention to detail was exceptional. The children were extremely well looked after with the sweetie car coming round in the evening to give them some treats! Fabulous relaxing holiday. Would highly recommend this hotel to families and couples.","5","2022-06"
"Visit of the Royal Suite for $100 - tourist trap and not worth the money - avoid at all costs and save your money !","For that price, they make such a big deal about it and you get to see a 25 years old suite that is  totally out of touch with today’s design trends … if this is their way of marketing their high priced suite at lower levels,  it’s a total failure ! 
Gold in every corner to represent their wealth with poor taste. Again save your $100 for something else in town ! My opinion anyway !","1","2022-11"
"Luxury at its best!","Was invited for lunch in a ballroom on the skybar level. The hotel ofcource is amazing well justifying its 6 stars, but so is the service offered by the very attentive staff!
However, regarding the food despite the presentation being excellent, the quality could be improved!","5","2022-11"
"Disappointed","We went on the Sal luxury cabana day pass. We had a nice day and was looked after very well at the cabana. Can’t fault the butler service and the spotless pools and scenery. 
We have been here before and I have to say this time when we left we was made to not feel wanted by the man at the entrance. 
We asked for a taxi and was told sit over there at the back. My mum had bad mobility so we said no it’s okay we will wait here, he clearly didn’t want this and kept saying sit over there at the back as taxi will be long time. Again I refused and he then made us go and wait inside reception. As soon as we got there the taxi arrived and we was scurried into the taxi. 
It clearly showed even though we paid the correct amount for the cabana we were not wealthy enough to be at the hotel. If you only want rich people then don’t offer excursions to the hotel. 
We were staying at the Address Downtown and this was so much nicer and more friendly than the Burj al Arab. Wouldn’t go there again.","3","2022-10"
"very impressive","Up early again, so started the day with a beach walk, before the heat of the day arrived. Headed towards the Burj Al Arab hotel, only stopped by their security check point. A very impressive building - it was pretty cool. ","4","2022-08"
"Soft pillows, soft bed, clean rooms, good washroom and toilets,                                                         ","Ive been to many hotels, but this was the best hotel ive ever been to, the rooms werent dirty at all and had very cool things ive never witnessed before, therefor its very cheap for such high rated resturang and such beautiful place. There are plenty of people in the rooms and they were so friendly so was the waiters in the resturangs that were in the hotel, it also has a very beautiful view that u can look outside from, so has the beach thats at the hotel, it was very beautiful and there were tons of amazing people there at the beach. This is the best experience ever and i will defiently be back here.","5","2022-07"
"Mixed feelings","We have mixed feelings about our stay at the Burj.

The inside is amazing - brilliant room, great service, amazing common areas, wonderful breakfast, squash court, indoor pool etc. All very exclusive and what you would expect - we were treated like royalty.

The pool area was very disappointing. They allow day trippers in there which totally ruins the scene. There is a swim up bar that is closed, you aren't allowed drinks in the pool (apparently it's a covid risk!!!) and you aren't even allowed to drink your drink at the swim up bar!!!

There are 2 pools outside - the nice infinity one and the boring family one that looks at a concrete wall. No one wants screaming kids ruining their time but we were told to leave the infinity pool because our kids were too young (aged 11 and 9) - even though they were with my wife and myself and we were literally at the edge just looking out. No swimming, no splashing, no balls and a hell of a lot quieter than the drunk day trippers. 

I have no idea why a resort of this quality would allow day trippers like some cheap resort. For this reason, and all their ridiculous rules, we won't be returning.","3","2022-09"
"PURE BLISS","Royal treatment is what you get from the moment you arrive at the main entrance all the way to checking out .You already feel luxury at this point .
Our stay at Burj Al Arab was superb from start to finish.  Having stayed in many hotels in Dubai , this is now our favourite and will definitely be returning .
Our room was stunning with great views and all the restaurants were excellent as we made sure we tried all of them .
What makes this hotel the only 7 rated hotel in the world are the staffs. Exceptional service and care received from three members of staffs in particular Rhoda , Josh and Ulukbek  who went  above and beyond to help us .
All in all , a fantastic stay in a beautiful hotel  .","5","2022-10"
"Tour of Burj Al Arab","We booked a tour of the Burj Al Arab, to include the Royal suites. Wow! Is an understatement of this tour, which I’d thoroughly recommend. We were looked after with such hospitality and consideration, and it’s easy to see that the Burj Al Arab lives up to its 7 star rating in every way.  
Vignesh patiently explained the history of the hotel and the area, via interactive 18 carat gold plated iPads, and it was wonderful to see the immense development over the years. We were given Arabian coffee and dates, before moving on to the Royal suites. Here, it was Andrew’s turn to bring them alive with his enthusiasm. Stunningly decorated and sumptuously luxurious in every way. 
I would visit again in a heartbeat. Thank you.","5","2022-10"
"A splendid hotel","A splendid hotel, breathtaking from a far with the same level of awe being kept throughout. Excellent service and great quality of food. We enjoyed a lot and looking forward to coming back!  Thank you to the great staff","5","2022-10"
"Burj Al Arab - not worth the hype","The hotel is beautiful but its the staff that mar the splendour. 
 All staff have plastic smiles and you can literally see that - no genuiness or warmth in welcoming you and YOU are the one actually paying for their salaries.
Rooms are smelly, the couches and carpets need shampooing.
Butler - just a fancy title, who disappers and doesnt inform you of charges. Goofs up your reservations and no apologies.
Staff clear your drinks and food plates whilst you are eating.
All staff are new and not trained in customer service. 
The cherry on the cake is the Reception who gives you bills with unknown charges (PLS CHECK YOUR BILLS BEFORE PAYING THEM)  
When you express displeasure they send you a person, apparently their manager (who doesnt wear a name tag nor gives his card- so you dont know if you are talking to an intern or to causal staff who has no clue what action to take) to address your concerns and all this guy does is hear you out.
Its like going to a psychiatrist. He doesnt offer to compensate or waive of the wrong charges.
The only commendable staff are the doormen, bellboys and housekeeping.

The lobby lounge : The entire lounge was empty but the girl refused to seat us (we were with a wheelchair person too) saying the lounge is fully booked, then she proceeded to ask us if we were staying there - we just walked out. Of course we are inhouse guests, ask us that before presuming that we are on some day tour with a wheelchair person. No empathy or genuine caring from the staff.
Worst service ever that I have encountered from all my travels and stays.
Bvlgari hotel - you have my vote as best service.","1","2022-10"
"Best Hotel ""7 Stars""","There is a reason they call it a ""7 Star"" Hotel. The size of the standard room is huge, literally a duplex apartment with all the best amenaties possible. With a complimentary happy hour from 5.30pm to 8pm every night, you can really sit down and enjoy the sunset views of Dubai. The restaurant options are also very good, and provide high quality food from award winning chefs. Special thanks to Ozzy from Al Mahara who was very helpful in selecting the best dishes for us to try. Also to Joleen from checkin who was very helpful and friendly during our checkin experience. Thanks to our butler Christopher who attended to all our needs. Also thanks to the very friendly Kristina the life guard from the Spa pool. These staff memebers made our stay extra special and memorable.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, as it is definitly worth is value, especially during the off season.","5","2022-10"

"Exceptional stay","I stayed at the amazing Burj Al Arab for three nights in September 2022. 
I resided in a Deluxe Palm Suite. The Suite was immense, large, luxurious and extremely clean.
I was most delighted with The Terrace and the team at SAL Restaurant who are super friendly and attentive. They are a credit to the hotel. The pool and restaurant facilities are outstanding. Super clean, comfortable and luxurious. A big thank you to Leila and her team at SAL!
I also wish to pay tribute to many of the reservations and front office team who were extremely helpful both before and during my stay. In particular, to Nikhail  Barretto, Joselito Cruz, and Mohammed Elsheshtawy who are amazing team members at the hotel. They dealt efficiently and swiftly with my reservation. Their patience in dealing with many of my requests and demands were tremendous. I also thank Natalia Haddad who dealt with me and with my final invoice in the most gentle and gracious manner. Outstanding! 
It is with this ultimate, and luxurious experience in mind, that I have already booked a further stay at the hotel in July 2023.
Very much looking forward to being back at the hotel and seeing the team members again.","5","2022-09"
"Fabulous","

"Good however dropped standards","Great Hotel but not quite 7*, I would say 6* on the hotel but 4* on bar/restaurant service. Great hotel and very unique and worth a visit. since covid standards have lowered but costs increased.A little disappointed on this visit compared to other visits.","4","2022-10"
"Go! Worth the splurge","A very cool place! Go! We stayed for two nights it was perfect to lap up the luxury. The service was maybe not as great as it should have been for the price. But, the architecture was amazing, loved the Arabian restaurant. Breakfast was lovely! Great food and views. Gym was good too, incredible views of the Arabian gulf. Loved our two story room and comfortable bed","5","2022-09"

 Every inch of this suite was immaculate with our own butler . Nothing too much trouble . Food amazing . Rolls Royce transfer brilliant .","5","2022-09"
"Cocktails at sky view bar, Burj Al Arab","Visited sky view bar for a friends 50th. Burj Al Arab doesn’t allow “walk up” visits so you’ll need to book if you want to get past security. The whole place is lavish. Cocktails weren’t cheap at 150 AED each. Minimum speed 200 AED per guest. 

Service and drinks excellent. The views and experience were outstanding .","5","2022-09"
"Luxury","Visited this place with my customers in September. It seems that Dubai is all about luxury… well here luxury takes totally new level. Views, service, food and drinks worth the price and time!!! Views over Dubai are stunning! Food is made from best ingredients!! Service in all languages!!","5","2022-10"
"Arabian Nights","The hotel is absolutely charming and not comparable to any hotel in the world. The suites are exquisite.
THe breakfast included is amazing with so many choices. The infinity pool is cool compared to the sea water at the beach. The beach is within walking distance but there are buggy's on stand bby that can take you to the beach too. There is also a small shopping center near buy with restaurants and bars. 
You can use what's app instead of calling reception or concierge and they are all very responsive from booking restaurants to anything you want even bringing extra coffee pods. 
It was 3 days in heaven. ","5","2022-09"
"Inside Burj Al Arab ","Visited here to do the tour of the king's suite. We really enjoyed our tour of the suite plus seeing other parts of the Burj Al Arab. There was no rush to go around and we were left to look around by ourselves when the guide had given us a briefing on the different rooms. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful.
Well worth the visit.","5","2022-10"
"Burj al Arab stay","All staff were excellent especially Ita at reception, they made us feel really special, the room and facilities were excellent, the breakfast was very nice with plenty of options.
Excellent swimming pools both indoor and outdoor.","5","2022-09"
"Perfection","We were lucky enough to return for the second time this year, this time with our daughters. The experience was again, faultless. Our girls had the best time. They loved everything but especially the infinity pool. The service at the pool was exceptional, we must mention Nikkal, Nagur and the pool manager TJ, they really did look after us. TJ came over to acknowledge that I am Coeliac and would need gluten free food. The food I ordered was delicious, the best GF club sandwich I’ve ever eaten. The service and attention to detail is what really makes this hotel. The rooms are fabulous, super clean, the amenities are outstanding. 
We must also mention the excellent service we received from Joleen on reception. 
We really did have the best summer holiday with our daughters. We were worried it wouldn’t live up to our first experience but it definitely did. So much so we are returning with one of our daughters in October and we can’t wait.","5","2022-07"
"Best hotel I have ever been to","I came to this hotel very skeptical and thought that there are too many talks about it and didn't understand why it considers a 7-star hotel.
I have been in many luxury hotels including approx 10 luxury hotels in Dubai and this is at least one level above all the best luxury hotels I have been to.

I must say WOW!
It is really so good!

All the rooms in the hotel are 2 floors and they look much better than you can see in the photos. You also get lots of gifts.  On each floor, 2 workers are there to help you with anything you need.

To summarize:
* The rooms are very beautiful and the hotel is very luxurious.
* The service is perfect.
* The pools are astonishing.
* Everything was amazing and above all my expectations.","5","2022-09"
"Luxury experience","An incredible experience! I use to go to luxury hotels, but stay at Burj has been exepcional, they make you feel special! First of all, all the rooms are suite, but We had an upgrade to a huge suite, because of my son birthday. The amenities from the room are hermes and includes perfums …The staff was amazing with us. Natalia, the brazilian girl, was the best. We had also a late check out..","5","2022-09"
"Honeymoon treat","We got engaged here 4 years ago and came back as part of our honeymoon.  This hotel is amazing and the attention from staff is second to none. However, this can also be a bit overpowering.  Having cleared security, we headed to the hotel building and were greeted warmly. It really is a stunning building brightly coloured and lots of ( too much ) gold everywhere. Our suite was amazing, over 2 floors which I didn't expect.  Spotlessly clean and tidy. Our butlers introduced themselves and were around for any request. On the way to the pool you get intercepted by a young lady who takes you to a sunbed, logs your location, and the personal treatment starts. The staff know who you are and are only a button press away. A cool bag of water soon arrives.  The hotel is constantly buzzed by jet ski's and small boats but they are kept a distance away although your hear them all day. The restaurants are excellent but obviously expensive.  In fact, nothing is cheap. Perhaps a nice touch would be to make the room mini bar free , given the cost of the room. The spa area is stunning and a great place to relax if you can shake off the staff who hover around you. On that note, as a couple who can think and do things for themselves, we sometimes found the attention a little overwhelming and unnecessary.  Though clearly, some will love it. Butlers at the door, housekeeping, housekeeping manager, butlers again, turndown service, butlers again, our doorbell didn't stop all evening every evening. People pressing the lift call button for you, greeting you when you get out of a lift, unfolding a towel for you. Sometimes it was just a bit much. However, this is a personal view and there were those who demanded and probably needed everything done for them. It really is a stunning hotel, over opulent and extravagant. A true once in a lifetime experience,  but you will pay highly for all that privilege.  If you don't get to stay there, book a tea or drink in the Skybar or their cocktail bar Gilt just for the experience.  Loved our stay here.","5","2022-09"
"Honeymoon Experience","A great hotel, where our stay was lovely. From the arrangement of our collection at the airport, to the personal excellent service at Sal. Food & drink excellent and reassuringly expensive… we will be back to one again enjoy this experience ","5","2022-09"
"Almost died by negligence at Burj Al Arab","Exactly one month ago, I have almost lost my life in front of my child and siblings. When I ordered Veggie omelet, I told the waiter I am severely allergic to mushroom. After a few bites of the omelet, I felt ill, my body getting warm and itchy all over my skin and I asked the waitress if my omelet has a mushroom. I still remember his face how panicked he was. He said I am sorry! At that time the symptoms were mild, and I told him I am okay. When we left the restaurant, they gave me flowers and went to my activities for the day.

Around 8pm I got a severe headache and couldn’t breathe, so I went to the reception desk and asked if they have any allergies medication or a nurse on duty. I told the manager Kristina Ignatova; I am having a hard time breathing because of allergy reaction from the omelet with mushroom I have consumed for breakfast. She said I will send the nurse over to your room, but if the nurse couldn’t do anything for you, you will have to pay the doctor’s fee for the treatment. I told her that it happened in your restaurant because your cook decided to put mushroom in my omelet after I clearly informed the waitress that I am allergic to mushroom. When someone is telling her I am dying all she was concerned about was the doctor’s fee; she shouldn’t discuss about the doctor fee at all while I am fighting for my life. It seems like my skin color blinded her to think that I can’t afford to my medical treatment. 

I was doing a breathing exercise until a nurse came to my room to save my life. My BP was 179/73….I could have stroke and my throat swollen and the nurse said “YOU COULD HAVE DIED IN 15 MIMUTES” in front of my child and siblings. Can you imagine the anxiety of my families???? Can you imagine losing my life 7500 miles away from home? ?? To save my life without reading the side effects the nurse administered injection and gave me 2 tablets to take it every 4 hours.

Few minutes after the nurse left the shortness of breathing got worse and the nurse came back with two doctors. After they examined me one of the doctors administered steroid injection and the other two were discussing how to take care of the 17-month-old sick kid throughout the night while I was fighting for my life. After they left, no one call or came back to check on me. I was ignored and neglected by the management and the medical team.
The next day, my siblings went to the pharmacy and bought blood pressure machine after they saw me suffering from sever headaches and a new cough. My blood pressure was high again. so I went to the reception desk and told the manager…..” how we were scared when the nurse told me I could have died…...I told her no one returned or call for follow up/ check back on me  ( normal medical procedures) after they administered two unknown medication-injection….I told her I feel like I wasn’t valued as a guest and ignored at her 7 star hotel.” She said I am sorry it has been a misunderstanding. 

Few minutes later I received a “get well soon” and apologies card, flower and perfume from the manager Kristina and her teams. I thought the perfume was unnecessary so I sent it back. I am guessing she gave me all that attention after finding out my identity…where I came from and my citizenship.

Two days later when the headaches got worse, my brother Googled the closest hospital and took me there. The doctor told me what you are having is normal after severe food allergic reaction especially mushroom. She said it will take a couples of weeks/months to feel normal. My lab results showed acid all over my body. She prescribed type of medication for 7 days and told me to rest at least for 7 days and spent over $10K USD to extend my return trip for another week. I went back to the doctor and she gave me another two types of medications to stop rectum bleeding.  

The F&B director came to my room and apologized for my bad experience and asked me what I want him to do for me. He was very nice person and easy to talk with. I asked him to provide me an incident report about the incident, and he said He will provide the incident report after the health and safety team finalized their investigation. I sent him a text to remind him but he said I cannot provide you any incident report. But the nurse emailed me the name and dosages of the injections and pills I took. 

One month since the incident and my body is not back to normal. My life is ruined because of that event. Nightmares …anxiety…What would have happened to my child and siblings if I lose my life far from home in front of their eyes…my child tells everyone I have almost lost my mom…my siblings are saying God is good you are still with us. I know the manager would have given me a better treatment, if I am not the person of color. 

I don't think the owners of the hotel will like their guests to be treated differently while we all pay the same amounts. I don't think the owners will take this life and death experience lightly.","1","2022-08"
"Best trip","We are staying in this hotel for many years now - starting from the opening

"Still Excellent!","Nice friendly staff, nothing too much trouble, food excellent, nice choice of properties to visit for a change of scenery. First visited in 2005 and there have been many changes, least of all the large pool area at the rear. A beach resort on top of the water??? Take a helecopter trip off the helipad, a great experience.","5","2022-09"

I cannot speak highly enough about the wonderful people who work here.  Special people in a special place!   ","5","2022-09"
"Treat yourself to a small bit of luxury!","Gorgeous property! It’s been believed that this is a 7-Star hotel and it surely reflected that. We also enjoyed breakfast and dinner in the hotel. The food was tasty and the service was exceptional! In addition, there are quite a few other dining options and activities on sight. The tour inside was amazing! As one could visualize, this is not a budget-friendly hotel, however, you will get what you pay for here!","5","2022-08"
"5 star (7 star) luxury hotel in 3 or 4 star style.","Is the title a bit too provocative? Judge for yourself...

You stand in front of the Burj Al Arab, you are greeted, you are welcomed in the Séparée room, it goes very quickly to the reception on the floor where the room is, checked in and accompanied to the room.....but stop, we are in the year 2022 no longer in 2018. The reception seems very cool and distant. In the hotel lobby, we were escorted to the darkest seating area, which was anything but comfortable. Checked in was also at a distance, first the passports fetched in the second step the credit card. One already noticed at this point that things were not as they had been.

Room:
as always, very clean and spotless, so you imagine a luxury suite on about 170m2. Simply a dream. But even in the room the red pencil was applied, no more computer and printer. Of course you can ask yourself if this is still needed in today's age 😉. Happy hour in the room, well, savings are also made there. Where previously a good champagne was served, there is only ""cheaper"" whiskey, gin, red or white wine.

Pool:
Adults Only! Is like any other hotel. Children and babies in diapers splash with their parents in/around the pool and the supervision allows it.

The pool itself has had better days. Several rust spots in the pool on the bottom and the little plates that decorate the poll are coming off. Since the pool is very clean, the missing stones and large rust spots are noticeable. You do not have to look for them 😉. Unfortunately, there are cost-cutting measures there as well. The pool bar in the freshwater pool was closed (perhaps only at our time).

Restaurants:
The Sal is highly recommended, service, advice, quality and quantity of food just top.

The Al Iwan is so-so. Service, we have had better. The dishes are cleared even when other people are still eating at the same table. There were also moments when you could hardly finish eating and the table was already cleared. Just for fun, we thought that maybe there was not enough crockery for the other guests, so they cleared up so quickly. The dishes themselves and also the quantity simply on a top level as in the Sal.

Maybe they should leave out the note on the website regarding dress code if no attention is paid to that.

In summary:
Hotel is still top and a feast for the eyes and worth a visit. Due to the management change, one notices that one or the other savings measures were made, but these are only noticeable if you compare it with the past. It is probably always like that.

Maybe we are a little old-fashioned, food and beverage card there is almost no more...only QR code. We know this only from fast food restaurants and cheaper hotels. But in an exclusive hotel like the Burj Al Arab? Even there you can ask yourself the following questions, are they cost saving measures, do they want to keep up with the times or just save resources? If you do this at the pool then it is one thing, but in the evening in a nice restaurant with an aperitif to study the menu, without cell phone, this has in my opinion something to do with elegance and style.","3","2022-09"
"The most Iconic 7 star hotel in Dubai","Burj al Arab broken an impressive number of records
In addition to being the tallest all-suite hotel in the world, in 2008 Burj Al Arab also broke the Guinness World Record for the most expensive cocktail, valued at 27,321 AED. It also created the world’s largest tin of caviar in 2016, which contained 17kg of Empress caviar – the world’s only fully-certified organic caviar from native-raised sturgeon.","5","2022-09"

"Try something else","Don’t worth the time, the tour took you to look the royal suites and some exhebition rooms. The guide is too week, always in a rush. In my opinion you can expend your time and money wisely.

"Sky View Bar - Out of this world","What can I say - words and pictures don't give it justice, how truely amazing the Burj Al Arab is. We had drinks and bites to eat at the Sky View Bar to celebrate our delayed 10 year wedding anniversary and it was amazing. The views from this bar are out of this world as are the views inside the lobby and all parts of the hotel. 

Special mention to Nithin, he is a credit to the Burj Al Arab and exemplifies what the Burj is about - luxury at its finest. We enjoyed our chats with him about the wines we enjoy from around the world. 

If you are coming to Dubai, visiting the Burj Al Arab is a must do.

One day we will be back to stay at the Burj","5","2022-09"

"Unforgettable stay!","I've stayed at Burj Al Arab twice in the last 12 months, 1st time with a colleague in Sep 21 and with my Husband in Feb 22. I've enjoyed the stay so much the both times.
Both suites we had were fantastic and had a beautiful city view along with Hermes toiletries!. We had tasty snacks (including caviar) waiting for us! The staff were wonderful and attentive. We were given a small guided tour of the room when checking and we were able to get in contact with the concierge through WhatsApp, which they replied straightaway. We had half board the first time and the concierge helped with dinner booking at one of the Madinat Jumeirah restaurants. We had breakfast at Al Ewan the first time and I spent more time admiring the beautiful interior and taking photos rather than eating! However, the dinner at SAL didn't go well for me as the only vegetarian option they had was pasta (the oven was out of order that night, so pizza) which wasn't great as they advertised. They did give us a beautiful cake with both of our names to end the dinner. When I went with my husband for Valentines day, they let us have the suite early free of charge, and had a bottle of their own wine and snacks in the room. On Valentines day, we were given a heart shape cake in the afternoon. This time, we thoroughly enjoyed having breakfast out on the terrace, overlooking the sea. The food was fantastic, lots of variety and tasty. Again, we were looked after by the staff very well. I also managed to go to GILT Dubai, to try one of their fantastic cocktails. Getting a table here is really hard and I had to thank out concierge for finding a slot for us. I can't write a review and not talk about the fabulous infinity pool with the palm view. I spent all my afternoons there, enjoying the breeze and beautiful sunsets. I can't wait to go back there soon and enjoy the luxury and service.","5","2022-02"
"Most amazing experience!!!","We celebrated our special wedding anniversary at Burj Al Arab and had the most amazing experience. Everyone went above and beyond to make our stay most comfortable and memorable. We are already looking forward to our next trip there. ","5","2022-08"
"Awesome Stay!","I stayed here in July of 2022 and had a great time. The only challenge I experienced was trying to get a wheelchair-accessible room. Apparently there is 1 accessible room in the hotel. I tried to get photos of the accessible room months prior but to no avail. When I arrived the only wheelchair room in the hotel wasn't ready so they did upgrade me to a beautiful room which I am grateful for. A part of me thinks that there isn't even an accessible room in the hotel. I have yet to see 1 photo of it anywhere on the internet. I guess there are not a lot of wealthy people in wheelchairs.  Anyway, this was a tiny challenge for me and in the end, the service and beauty of the place make up for this. 

Overall, awesome! I will certainly visit the Burj Al Arab in the near future even if there is no accessible room :)","5","2022-07"
"The best of the best","This hotel far exceeds your expectations, the staff are another level carefully chosen to make your stay very special. The rooms are outstanding with amazing views.

"Amazing afternoon experience at Sahn Eddar!","Had an amazing afternoon experience dining at Sahn Eddar inside Burj Al Arab. We booked in advance and the entire afternoon experience took about 2 hours.

We went in thinking that this was going to be one of those high end places where you pay a premium for small portions and mediocre food, but to our surprise, every single dish was amazing! From the savoury beef rolls to the delicious tarts. Every dish was well plated and thought out, and tasted absolutely incredible.

Our server, Wanwan, gave us exceptional service and helped us take a few photos as well with the Burj Al Arab backdrop. We also got a rose and cake to celebrate our honeymoon!

One thing to note though, is that the afternoon tea experience does NOT include their signature gold cappuccino. You will have to order this separately if you want to try it. Since we were there already, we decided to order it anyway despite knowing it was going to be a little gimmicky. Other than the gold flakes on top, it just tasted like a regular cappuccino, for about USD 32. At least you can say you tried it.

Otherwise, this was a great experience to try the afternoon tea and to also visit inside Burj Al Arab to take pictures of its beautiful architectures (you can't get into Burj Al Arab otherwise unless you have a booking for the night).  

It is a little pricey, but I would say you're basically paying for an afternoon tea + entrance fee to go inside.","5","2022-08"
"Extremely helpful workers","My experience was brilliant. Bhairav in particular assisted me in using the mens facilities and ensured I had everything I needed to get ready before my return flight home. He also dried my swimwear for me which was a very helpful touch.

Thank you so much for a wonderful experience.","5","2022-08"
"Shocking customer service at check in","We arrived here this afternoon having stayed a few days at the Atlantis with our two boys. 

We booked both the hotels via booking.com .
We had no issue with our older son being over 12 when we checked in at the Atlantis but here at the Burj Al Arab they refused to check us in without paying an additional dhs 1250 ( £500 ) per night .
They would just not budge even though we explained that we had booked the same way for both the hotels and how we had put the ages for both the boys when we booked .
Apparently our older son was above 12 so he is classed as an adult hence the £500 per day extra .
Ahmed was the one who made it difficult for us and kept on saying “ I understand but it’s nothing to do with me . 
We showed them how we booked and put the age of our older son on the booking.com website and the price was still the same but he would just not budge .
We asked for a refund and said we will go elsewhere but that was not possible he put his hands up and said nothing to do with them if we want a refund you booked with booking.com so you should contact them . He was the one that was causing an issue about the age of our son which we had showed him how we had booked .
It was an issue they should have sorted with booking.com , they just left us waiting around for an hour , basically no refund and no check in .
Having just experienced Atlantis we were shocked with this unprofessional behaviour.

Anyway they would not help us and eventually booking.com was contacted and they said they would try to sort the issue out  which they did .

Booking .com spoke to Burj al Arab and all was fine .
It’s a shame booking .com had to sort out an issue that Burj al Arab could have done . 

Ahmed after all that  had the cheek to say we will charge for one breakfast even though booking.com told us all was included .

We didn’t have breakfast on the last morning as we left early all 4 of us but that’s ok we wouldn’t ask for a refund for that .

A 7 star hotel and this was worst behaviour than a 3 star hotel . 
Customer service upon check in this poor was very shocking .
Imagine if we had arrived at the Burj al Arab straight after a 7 hour flight . 

The reason I removed only the 1 star and not 3 ( considering what we payed for ) is because the remainder staff were very welcoming and the care they provided was truly worth mentioning here .
The staff at the breakfast service , the butler service , the buggy service the cleaning staff all were very friendly and caring .","4","2022-08"
"Royal experience at Burj Al Arab","An experience that must be experienced to be believed. Amazing property, Super technology, Fabulous customer engagement and service, Brilliant facilities.

"""Truly a luxurious stay""","My son wanted to see Burj Al Arab and we decided for a staycation. We received fantastic service from checkin to check-out. We requested for an early check-in and our room was ready when we arrived the hotel. The room was luxurious and it gives you a feeling of staying in a Palace.  My son really enjoyed every moment spent in Burj Al Arab. We loved the hospitality and gesture received from all the staff during our stay from inroom services, house keeping and restaurant staff. 
My son Neil really enjoyed every moment spent in Burj Al Arab. 

Exceptional service received at Sahn Eddar cafe, my son wanted to eat something which was not in menu and the restaurant staff made sure and got it ready for my son. Also we loved the fabulous service received from Imtiaaz and Arjun from Al Iwan restaurant during our morning breakfast. My wife is a vegetarian and they both made sure she gets some good vegetarian dish during breakfast.

MR.ADHAM & MR.ISMAIL were cooperative.","5","2022-08"
"1st Class","Every member of the team at the Burj Al Arab have been 1st class, the food is out of this world, especially in Al Muntaha! The hotel has been kept very well and is as clean as you would expect the best hotel in the world to be.

"From NYC to Burj Al Arab","We stayed here for a night. The service was top-notch and one of the best serviced hotel I have stayed at. The interior design was breathtaking as were the suites! It was a daughter and mom trip and we were stunned by the two story suite. So much space for two people! We felt like queens LOL I felt like I was treated with royalty and EVERYONE was helpful and always greeted us. Definitely a MUST stay. ","5","2022-08"
"Amazing","Wow! We have always been curious about the hotel - whether it is “all that”: and it is. My sister and I were there for 1 night, and had the time of our lives! The hotel is simply stunning. The rooms are completely wow! The service is faultless. Amazing breakfast. Have absolutely nothing to complain about. Once in a life experience, and absolutely worthy!
 Ps: we were in the 20th floor - and the butler was simply the best! Super nice!","5","2022-08"
"Best hotel ever!!!!","I treated like a Queen! The suite was so beautiful and the food was amazing. Everybody was polite and ready to help. Thanks to the staff of Burj Al Arab, I will definitely visit again with my family the next time around.","5","2022-08"
"Amazing hotel","Everything was great - the welcoming, the service, the staff, the suite, the food, the view, the pools, the restaurants - everything! Best hotel I’ve even been too. Thank you for everything, hope to visit again…","5","2022-08"
"LUXURY","My friends and I had an amazing experience from the arrival time till departure and we really understand why its the only 7 Star Hotel in the world .
Evenings were outstanding,  restaurants and suites were to perfection .The best part was the staffs working here . They are very helpful and friendly,  highly recommended to all the travellers .
Thank you to Rhoda especially for all the assistance  throughout our stay , see you next time .","5","2022-08"
"MUST VISIT AND NEEDS TO BE ON BUCKET LIST ❤️","This is a special place that everyone has to experience for at least one night if you are able to.
The rooms are out of this world and exceeded all expectation. The service of the excellent staff, architecture, food and history cannot be beaten. We will be back but would recommend 2 nights as there is so much to experience.","5","2022-08"
"Burj Al Arab","This hotel is luxurious and absolutely superb. Every member of staff, from the security guard at the front, the friendly door men, the professional concierge, a special mention to Jeremy on the desk with the best smile and greeting. The butlers on the floor 13, Adrianna and Adrian, look after your every need without being imposing. The room is spotless, the facilities are beautiful. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious. We could not have asked for more from anyone. Treat yourself and visit this hotel. You will not be disappointed.","5","2022-08"
"Seven stars","A memorable stay at Burj al Arab.

I can now understand why it is called the only 7 stars hotel in the World. From the staff to the facilities, everything was perfect and you feel really pampered throughout the whole stay.
","5","2022-08"
"COULD DO BETTER","this was our second Stay at the Burj and unfortunate their have been changers Not positive ones.
the standard burj welcome not present being checked in within the lobby !! why? then being shown to the suite and left with No interaction from any Butler introduction or perviously a welcome drink which was the standard welcome This was a bad start to the week (this is a small item but a standard you would expect at the Burj)
the introduction of E Butler this should be a add on not a replacement to the normal great service 
The suite felt it had been STRIPPED of all Amenities such as Hotel information /reading material/Apple computer.
The lack off personal service was disappointing to say the least 
Pool area 
I'm not sure if this as been sold off to Sal 
and entry is Run by ex military gate keepers but just to walk around the pool area was like going through a full interigation 
meal reservations great however the were treated like a day visitor we had beer experiences at other Restaurants such as Rockfish so when you are spending over 5,000 and on a meal i would expect the service to be seven starts to match the hotels reputation 

on leaving I tried contacting the butler for our invoice Which never arrived so back to the lobby to check out REALLY !!

Come on Burj this was so disappointing and Not good enough 
one last note
instead off looking after internet Influences you need to look after Paying guest","3","2022-07"
"Thank you for  the lovely dine","Every time we visit Dubai we stay at Burj al Arab in this amazing hotel.Always on the last night of our stay we dine at the Al Muntaha restaurant. This time, however, was special, we had a better time than ever, thanks to George and Eleftherios, with their kindness, professionalism and of course the excellent dishes they recommended!!! 
Thank you guys so much for this great evening!!
See you soon","5","2022-08"
"A Sublime Experience at the Burj al-Arab!","I just stayed at the Burj al-Arab for Friday & Saturday with family (my 7 year old godson and his father),
And we had the most amazing time.
The ‘standard’ suite, over 170 sq.m. (1900 sq.ft.) on 2 floors, was amazing.
We were on the 9th floor (I prefer lower floors, for security reasons), and still had the
most wonderful view, thanks to the wonderful location of ‘The Burj’, as someone 
referred to it.
All the food was sublime (Afternoon Tea on the first floor; Friday night dinner on the 27th floor;
Room Service in our cabana at poolside {Even the chicken fingers (nuggets on the kids’ menu)!}; Saturday night dinner at the Arab restaurant on the first floor; Restaurants were listed in the order we ate in them {Sorry - I have Aspergers}).
The Spa was wonderful as well.
Truthfully, everything was wonderful.
But the best was the service.
People were so genuinely eager to help and enrich our stay.
My 7 year old godson wants to move in permanently!
Sorry, Eitanuli. We are staying in Israel.
We waited too long to return to our Ancestral Homeland…","5","2022-08"
"Vacay at Burj!","We stayed at Burj Al Arab for 8 days. The first day we had a bad experience and were very unhappy. I want to give a shout out to Razmik from food and beverage for taking care of us. He was very professional, friendly, accommodating and made our stay exceptional. He pays attention to detail and personally came to our table multiple times. He always put a smile on our face. He made sure every day was better than the day before. He really took great care of us.","5","2022-06"
"Service non-existent","This is not a 7star service, not even 5. You find 5 star resorts even 4 star with better service. Book four season or Shangri-la instead. If you want to stay 1 night for the experience to tick the box then ok, why not the building is beautiful. But if you want to have a nice holiday like us and stay more nights then avoid. My stepson was coming to stay last night with us so we asked for extra bed. I had booked like this months ahead. First they called that the extra bed is possible with extra charge. I said no problem. I am not staying several nights at this type of hotel and not be able to pay for extra bed for 1 night. Anyway the point is that during our stay I had to reconfirm that extra bed several times and each time I was reminded the extra charge like I was not going to pay. 7 star hotel should not make you feel like a criminal.
Our floor smelled of sewage and buttler service is non-existent. Waitting 2hrs for extra hangers, had to call 3x times. Again if you want to experience this architectual delight, by all means do it. If you are looking for 7 star service promissed don't waste your money.","1","2021-12"
"Special Birthday Surprise","This was our second time in Dubai and this week was a surprise for my wife. We changed hotels (something my wife hates doing) but had the last 3 nights at this hotel in a suite! 

It was amazing and the room and service were fabulous. The butlers were also so helpful and friendly.  The flowers they placed in the room were stunningly perfect and the staff came by to sing Happy Birthday which brought tears to both our eyes.

We will definitely go there again.","5","2022-06"
"Excellent  staff service","Priya,  Sudhir, Josh, Imtiayz, Vidhi, Sunita. Orsho, Adriene, Vikram provided excellent and personal touch throughout our stay. They made us feel home and took extra care of all our needs. The facilities excelllent. Most of all the staff at all departments from housekeeping, front office, restaurants, butlers all were professional and made our stay more memorable. We look forward to return","5","2022-08"
"Wonderful staying","I would like to thank everyone works in the hotel. They were friendly and well services. It was an amazing staying and i enjoyed every single minute in the hotel. All the services and response from housekeeping, butler, reception, valet, security, resturant, cleaner, …etc were wonderful. Foods were delicious and the best. 
Thank you very much for everything","5","2022-08"
"Lifetime experience","Excellent service from check in to check out. Attention from staff was second to none and made us feel special at all times.
In room dining was excellent quality and prompt service as well as good value.","5","2022-08"
"Outstanding property and remains just as exclusive","Had the pleasure of the BAA in July - and wow what a property it still is. I had wondered if some of the exclusivity and special-factor may have worn off but it certainly hadn't.

Passing through the throngs of people taking pics from the gatehouse, and then being permitted to drive over the bridge to access the property remains something to behold.

From the gatehouse, valet, concierge, etc. everyone was super polite and friendly not to mention welcoming and accommodating. 

Some say its starting to looks a little worn, I would disagree and everything was exactly as you would expect at the price point - and the Hermes additions are just perfect.

Afternoon Tea in Sahn Eddar is excellent and highly recommended with great views back over towards Jumeriah (even with the beach building works) and upwards within the worlds tallest atrium.

Faultless all around and can't wait to return imminently.","5","2022-07"
"Anniversary stay","We stayed at the hotel to celebrate our anniversary and it was great and memorable experiences , the check in was a bit slow and no one offer a drink or water while they kept us waiting which wasn't expected from 7 stars hotel, otherwise I recommend it.","5","2022-07"
"Biulding site behind at to the north with sea full of unpleasant  white polystyrene like granules till midday at least..","Great location 
Mostly so iconic
Great space
Tried hard
Shame about dirty sea and sea filled with unpleasant stuff as they spry sand from sea bottom to crest new beach and hotel location next door
Front outside pool awesome
Security at the place is great
Greeting staff as you arrive great
Reception girl who checked me in was slow and rude","3","2022-08"
"Superb","Amazing from start to finish... the whole process of arriving and leaving the hotel is special and so well done. We were given a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite which was incredible and had the best views of jumeirah beach hotel.  The pool area is special and is set up for perfectly watching sunset with a great backdrop of the gulf and the palm island..
Breakfast was also amazing.. nothing like we have ever seen before.
One thing I especially loved was that there were no ""influencers"" or the like about. There was no exhibition of fashion labels or people there just to show off, just guests doing their own thing in peace..
Staff were incredible, from the doormen who knew our names to the floor butlers who couldn't do enough for us..
Wouldn't hesitate to book again.","5","2022-08"
"Family visit","It was really a great stay with my family in suite 502 and 503. And special thanks to all the staff for being helpful with all our requests. Special thanks to Sophia our butler and Abubaker for always taking care of our requests when going to the beach and taxi requests. We will surely be back next year.","5","2022-07"
"What a day !!","A day that will never forgotten. An incredible place with a very kind stuff. All the facilities and pools and gym are WOW ! Well done Jumeira Group ! Well done Burj Al Arab. We really enjoyed our anniversary in a huge luxury place. Must come again .","5","2022-07"

"Burj Al Arab disappointment","Extremely disappointed,
Living now + 15!years in UAE.
Calling the billing center of Burj Al
Arab, booking a Carbana
Mentioning our membership number on their own App, asking for the discount we get on F@B 
And at the time our asking for your invoice ….. surprise surprise
No discount !!!!!!
I was under the impression that such marketing behavior are only use our side of UAE?? But guess I’m wrong ……

Anyhow ….. last time I spend my free time at such a place who is trying to bait there clients wich such Technics","1","2022-07"

"Simply amazing","Not the first and certainly not the last time we will be staying in this iconic hotel. Yes it is now getting a little tired but the feeling of being on top of the world from start to finish never leaves you","5","2022-07"
"Excellent experience","If you are looking for top service, luxury, privacy, best food, exclusivity.......this is the place to be.
I do travel around the world for business, but, this hotel is unbeatable. From the time that you check in to the check out , you do feel to be in a different world.","5","2022-07"
"Best experience ever at burj Al Arab","Our stay from start to end is amazing thanks to great team. We felt they manage the jobs like orchestra.
Thanks to Ms Simona who always consider us and our guests like royals.

"Luxury at its best","Had a great 4 days in this iconic hotel with best service and outstanding luxury and details to every single aspect of the customers expectations to exceed in the overall experience, our stay would not have been better and will definitely come back. Special thanks to the Hotel Management for the great hospitality and room upgrade as well as welcoming amenities. ","5","2022-07"
"The hotel rooms old and the service was bad 👎","I have to state of  my total disappointment with regards to my last stay at Burj Al Arab ; due to the following facts :
 
    1. Many of the suite furniture are old , worn out or with faded colours , including the  old IMac!
    2. There was a lot of dust on our first suit which can be seen clearly on the attached clip as my family suffering from asthma ; they have noticed the accumulation of Dust on many places !!!
    3. The breakfast took more than an hour to reach our suit and after many follow up calls with missing items.
    4. The suit windows were dirty and hence  the view was obstructed !!
    5. The suit view was a construction site which was totally unpleasant to see.
  
  6.Whenever  we call the butler by pressing on the telephone button an operators were answering, so it doesn’t make sense having a dedicated butler ?

7. At 12:00 PM a gentleman from front office knocked our door asking what time we will check-out despite being advised by the duty manager for a late check out ? and he could of called us instead of knocking the door.
غرف الفندق قديمة و الخدمة سيئة للغاية","1","2022-07"
"Lives up to everything you would expect and more","This place has earned the right to be called a 7-star hotel.  We had incredible service from Timothee and our butlers Carol and Koko.  I was celebrating my 51st birthday and they had many surprises planned to make it extra special.  I have stayed at many hotels, but nothing is quite like the Buji Al Arab.  Stay here and you will never want to leave.","5","2022-07"
"Expensive but kinda worth it","Not really in my plan due to the very expensive ticket (259 AED by at the site). However I felt really happy to visit it due to the content of the tour, which giving you not only the best view of the Coach and Palm Island but also the truly witness of the Middle East Royal Living lifestyle.","4","2022-07"
"Memorable","Everything about the Burj Al Arab is magnificent. A perfect combination of practicality, modernity and luxury. The staff also impresses by the elegance and respect in the service. It is a hotel that deserves to be known, as it is a little piece of paradise on earth.","5","2022-07"
"Great service","We treated ourselves to a weekend here on 24/6/22

Our plane arrived very early in the morning and we had emailed the hotel to let them know
Our flight landed at 2 am but we were able to use the Jumeirah lounge at terminal three Dubai airport which was lovely and had showers on site. 

On arrival to the Burj,  Josh at the reception desk was fantastic and checked us into our room straight away at 6 am. 

We were really grateful as we were very tired from the flight. 

Thanks Josh ","5","2022-07"
"Amazing birthday celebration","We enjoyed an unforgettable experience for mine and my daughter’s bday celebration with all the family. The hotel is amazing, the staff super helpful and they made us feel very special for our bday with flowers included. We will definitely go again. ","5","2022-07"
"Awesome hotel, terrible service","It would be a 5 stars review if their restaurant reservation team are doing their job. 

Today me and my family had a chance to stay at this amazing hotel. Everything was perfect except the bad experience we had with their Restaurant Reservation Team. 

I booked the chinese restaurant Zheng He’s for lunch a few weeks ago. However when we arrive at the restaurant, the staff told us that the restaurant is not opened for Lunch, that they don’t have my contact details to inform me about it. I don’t think this is acceptable for a so-called 7 stars hotel. This has absolutely ruined our afternoon, in which we need to bear the summer heat to move from Jumeirah Al Salam to Al Naseem. Luckily the food and the staff at Kayto restaurant were amazing, that I quickly forgot about what happened. 

It would be awesome if they can informed us about the closure at least few days in advance. The fact that the restaurant didn’t even get my contact number, shows how bad the service is.","2","2022-07"
"Tired old lady.","The hyper by far over sells what one gets at this hotel. 

The list of dissatisfaction and over all experience is endless. 

From the buggy's driving past is in the heat and not picking us up to the staff with a clear communication barrier. 

The rooms need a serious renovation with the  fabrics faded and the carpets dirty and fluffing as well as the phones that are ancient and stuck in the 90's. 

Only 2 of the five restaurants on the property open as well as the kids club being closed and no disclosure of the fact upon booking. 

I ordered eggs for breakfast at the buffet and never received my order.

The plug in the room was not plugged in and when we asked for assistance not knowing what was wrong, no-one came to assist us. 

There were no face towels available despite the fact that we were taken on a tour of the hotel to so called give the staff time to prepare our room. 

I could carry on forever. 

We informed management of our concerns and NOTHING was done about it. 

We will never recommended this hotel to anyone and never return. ","1","2022-07"
"Burj Al Arab experience","One of the best hotels I’ve ever visited in the world. Excellent staff service as well as the complete 7-star experience. Words do not do the beauty of the Burj Al Arab justice. Every aspect of our stay was perfectly curated.","5","2022-07"
"Stayed with family.","It is a nice 5 start hotel with high end interior. But don't keep your hops too high. Based on the marketing they have done always people expect lots more from this hotel. Food and service is just average. ","4","2022-07"
"Exceptional","The stunning building is only the start. The room, the food and the amenities are only surpassed by the exceptional service. Whether at check-in, having breakfast or lounging at the pool, the level of service is unsurpassed.","5","2022-06"
"Amazing Service from Amazing People","We visited on July 2nd, 2022 as a family. The suites are amazing. Note to mention the people. From the greetings we are treated as a real king. Nick greeted and showed us the room very well. Ronnie assisted us with the luggages. And the best part when we were in a buggy. Firoj not only driving us around the hotel but entertained us , esp my son. Appreciate for these 3 people. Will definetely coming back. The price is uncomparable with the services we received. Well done team","5","2022-07"
"7-stars indeed","Everything 7 stars at Burj Al Arab. Special thank you to Simona the concierge for setting up my trip and everyone all staff and Ibrahim the RR driver. Stayed 5 days and it wasn’t enough. Incredible hotel, feels like home. ","5","2022-07"
"There’s a reason(s) it’s rated 7 star hotel!","From the check in and check out it was a smooth process. We were upgraded to a master suite and checked in early. The decorations are so beautiful. The hotel is clean and spotless. The design is one of a kind - from the lobby, lounges, restaurants and pool (especially the main pool facing the ocean).  Breakfast is very good. Made dinner reservation at the Al Muntaha; the view, food and the service is perfect. I will emphasize the attentiveness and service of the staff is superb. This is why its rated 7 star hotel. Thank you for making our stay so memorable. We will be back and next time will stay a little bit longer.","5","2022-06"
"Outstanding and unique hotel and service experience","Our stay was completely outstanding, from the hotel overall (rooms, restaurants, pool area, lobby, etc.), to the excellent, very professional and courteous service received from every single employee at the Burj Al Arab. Impeccable attention to details, and everyone going well being our expectations. This also applies to employees and services at the beach.
What we experienced at the Burj Al Arab has changed our understanding of “superb and unique” in terms of service and outstanding top quality in everything.","5","2022-07"
"Service on another level","We stayed for 3 nights having stayed in the Al Naseem for a week, celebrating a retirement. The Al Naseem was excellent, but this place cannot be compared to other hotels in Dubai, it’s like Christmas morning or Disneyland for grown ups, absolute luxury and incredible service levels.

Public areas, restaurants, pool terrace, spa and suites etc etc are all in your face indulgence and luxury.

Each and every member of staff were professional, polite and incredibly friendly and efficient. The whole experience was wonderful. We ate poolside, at Sals and Al Muntaha twice, along with breakfast the food is of the highest standard. Our server Peter in Al Muntaha was excellent.

We were looked after by our butlers Carol and Hitesh, they were so attentive and charming and met our every need it was a delight to meet them and I would appreciate it if you passed on my thanks, they typified all the Burj stands for: Quality and exceptional service. We never got to say goodbye to Carol as we left early, but I also thank her for her thoughtfulness and superb caricature of my partner and I, she is a credit to the hotel.

The only downside is this was a once in a lifetime experience, now my partner has said we have to go again so it’s back to saving !!!!

Fantastic Hotel, wonderful service and staff.","5","2022-06"

"Outstanding & Amazing!","Beautiful hotel with amazing rooms and views!  We were on the 13th floor, Palm view.  The Butler service is top notch.  They are attentive and cater to whatever needs you have from dinner reservations to storing our personal champagne.  The Lexus driver service at the hotel is top notch, we used them the entire stay for tours and all transportation needs.  They don't just drop you off like an Uber service, they stay wherever you are (restaurant, etc.) until you're done- LOVED that!  The food was amazing, the breakfast was outstanding and the Italian restaurant was awesome!  The service overall was the best ever and we've stayed at Ritz Carlton's, etc. all over the world.  The housekeeping staff was also great, every time we left, our room was refreshed!  BEST EVER was the air conditioned pool cabanas.  When it's 100+ degrees, this is a life saver! This hotel is worth the money!! Will come back.","5","2022-06"

"The old shabby lady","Burj - top of the hotel world… No, very sorry, but not! You get a suite, which is the same like was at the opening 23 years ago… they trade to keep it clean, but time is time - you feeled like in clean, old hostel in Mumbai. Yes, clean…BUT abraded covers, trouble with water drain in bathroom… AND sevice… a lot of people around, but slow and not extremely helpfull. AND - they push you to spend… internal policy is, that every guest “must” spend 1 500,- dirham per night…RESULT: visit in Burj today is wasting time and wasting money.
One exeptions! Al Mahara restaurant and GILT bar - both in new interiors, great food and service in restaurant and inovative, nice drinks in the bar ( and my favorite rosé, Chateau Minuty…)

"Excellent Service","I am speechless with the amount of perfectionism and care I received from all the staff at The Burj Al Arab; however, I would like to take this time to praise Achol Mordicai, the doorman. This is my second time visiting this prestigious hotel and both times I was given exemplary customer service and kindness by Achol. Not only did he always greet me with a warm smile, but he also made sure to ask if I was enjoying my time. I can honestly say that you all have a great asset to your team and hope to see him be promoted, for all the hard work he does. Any question or issue I had he handled it fast and made sure I was taken care of - thank you! I will be returning again, thanks to Achol and all the staff that I interacted with.","5","2022-05"

I will definitely comeback with such kindness you have shown and for the wonderful fond memories.","5","2022-05"
"Surprise family stay at Burj Al Arab","We surprised our girls (6 & 11) with a stay at the beautiful & opulent Burj Al Arab before we bid Dubai farewell after nearly 7yrs.
Our suite was incredible & blew us away from the size, to our own staircase, to the most comfortable beds, to the incredible bathroom.
Our girls were treated like princesses & spoilt rotten by the staff.
All the staff from front of house, to our butler, to even the pool staff were incredibly helpful & friendly.
We loved every minute of our stay & highly recommend the Burj Al Arab.","5","2022-06"
"Amazing, fantabulous","Absolutely amazing, except for family rooms apart.
The overall experience was superb

When we entered room it was awe.. never seen that luxury ever before.
The lobby, gold coffee, recreational activity all are above 5 star luxury","5","2022-06"
"If you can, this hotel should experienced at least once in your life","For anyone reading this and sitting on the fence about whether or not a hotel can really be worth such a price point, let me detail a few things below that really sets the Burj Al Arab apart, from any other hotel in the world.

Every single room is a suite that's spread over 2 floors. The rooms are luxurious to the point it seems almost impossible to believe, the furniture is pristine and the views are unparalleled.

We had originally booked the Panoramic Suite to celebrate our anniversary and Josh at reception took great delight in informing us that we'd been upgraded to the Club Suite. Now the upgrade was incredible but the happiness was clear to see on Josh's face, he really wanted this for us because like every other member of staff at the Burj Al Arab, he just wanted us to have the most memorable stay possible.
I honestly could not do this room justice, it was bigger than our apartment. It had 3 living areas, a kitchen, a games room (including ping pong table!) and the most spectacular view of Dubai. It was spotlessly clean and the winding staircase just looked and felt so special.

Regardless of which room you stay in, every single detail about this hotel is beyond belief. It's difficult to describe just how happy and incredibly fortunate you feel to be walking around it. 

Breakfast was delicious and again the views of the marina have to be seen to believed. The waiting staff are confident, personable and so genuine in their commitment to excellence.","5","2022-06"
"After Wedding Gala at Burj","Indian Styled after Gala event at Bab Al Yam made my event outstanding. The operations team headed by Shahid and team ( Swapnil and Farhan) helped me in setting and organizing my event at their best. The food menu headed by Mr. Giovanni and Team gave the guest another level food experience at the Burj.","5","2022-06"
"A Royal Hotel for the elite on the beach of Dubai","I took a tour to see this hotel and it was better than seeing on the movies that's for sure.

The tour guides were professional and we got to see this best suite for royally and omg!

24 kt televisions as well as showers.  Really? Haha! I could see lots of hold jewelry I could make.

Beautiful rooms with ornate decor. Luxurious tubs, dining tables for for a wedding party.  Oh, and king sized bed that rotates.

And panoramic views from every window from this unique hotel on the ocean.","5","2022-06"
"The burj","The burj is a magnificent hotel, our stay was perfect from start to finish. The level of service is second to none, the staff are so helpful, the rooms are fabulous and the food is fantastic. Cannot recommend enough","5","2022-06"
"Bucket list stay and it was unbelievable!!","To finally cross the bridge to stay at this iconic hotel was a long held dream and boy did the experience not disappoint. The opulence, the facilities and especially the level of service are off the scale. Big thanks to Carmen who made us feel like kings on arrival, to our butlers who were so attentive (but not intrusive) and especially to Bhairav in the spa who treat us like old friends and took care of everything before our departure. The breakfast is the best we've ever had and the pool areas are simply perfect. Huge thankyou to all of the staff who made 3 lads from Sunderland feel so special.","5","2022-06"
"Probably the best staycation hotel in my live except...","1. e-butler didnt really help. I couldn't access my room and I have to down to lobby from 7th floor and reactivate it
2. I heard from other friends their floor butler entertained much better than 7th floor butler did.
3. Buggy service took quite long to arrive (more than 15 minutes) at the beach station to get back to the hotel","4","2022-06"
"best hotel by far","service and hotel was breathtaking made our stay one to remember.  the buffet breakfast was amazing and the surprise harp player made our day

like to recognize the night duty manager (bezza) for all his help and assistance to make our stay the best experience and Aneesh who welcomed us every time we was in the entrance area","5","2022-06"
"Sal restaurant","We dined lunch in Sal restaurant inside of Burj Al Arab, the service was very on standard, very strictly following LQA standards. The waitress Sofia was very friendly,  patient and  experienced. The waiters all have smile on their faces! Great experience! Love it! 😍","5","2022-06"
"You have to see it to believe it!","We stayed here for three nights for our long awaited Honeymoon and first year anniversary. 

At first, I was slightly scpetical especially due to the price tag and plethora of hotels in Dubai, but the Burj Al Arab really does not compare. Photos online do not do this place justice, you really have to see it to believe it and understand the history to appreciate why this is the only 7 star hotel in the world.  
 
It is also really the staff that make up the experience and there was no need to ever leave the hotel with all the beautiful facilities (spa, infinity pool and summersault beach club) and restaurants. A special mention to Peter at breakfast, the delicious Arabic food at Al Iwan, Marine at Al Muntaha, WanWan at Sahn Eddar, Federico and partner at Al Mahara (A must! The food was absolutely mid blowing!) Luis at Gilt bar, Knowledgeable staff at the inside Burj Al Arab tour, Butlers, Housekeeping, buggy drivers and Samuel at the door all working tirelessly to make sure you are making memories to cherish forever. 

We had an absolutely unreal time and hope to return again someday. 

Your happy honeymooners! :)","5","2022-05"
"Full Body Massage","Mr Bhairav was super hospitable, and just an absolute joy. We was very welcoming and walked me through the ‘spa’ process step-by-step. His service is unparalleled, and I am wishing him all the success!","5","2022-06"
"Worth Every Penny (which it may cost)","Stayed here several times and each time is more memorable that the next. The attention to detail I'd unmatched and it's the best hospitality execution I've experienced.

The restaurants in the hotel are a bit overpriced for what you get but that's easily avoided by dining out.

Overall memories and experiences from staying here will make you work just a bit harder to be able to return here.","5","2022-05"
"Very impressive hotel","Think of the most luxurious hotel you can imagine and just double everything you can think of. As a guest I felt as if i were playing a part in a James Bond movie without the violence. From the grand entrance way and marble staircase to the second story of our suite, from the dining area to the very large living room to our extraordinary bedroom and bath, the experience was over the top. Any surface you could decorate with gold was so decorated. Very grand but it together suggested the last days of the Roman Empire.","5","2022-05"
"The best hotel in dubai with 7 star service","I would highly recommend staying at the Burj Al Arab to anyone visiting Dubai.  It’s without doubt the best hotel in Dubai, not just for its look and feel but for its service too.  From Anna at hospitality service to Asif in the gym the staff can’t do enough for you.  I was recovering from an injury and the personal training from Asif in the gym helped me get back on track with his bespoke program.   Check it out you won’t be disappointed 

Leon","5","2022-06"
"Amazing and spoiling","Great service, excellent food (I'm italian), best pastry in UAE, spoiled at any step. 
I celebrated my wedding anniversary and it was absolutely like living in a movie. 
1 night stay is equal to 1 week everywere.","5","2022-05"
"Spa/Sauna facilities","Working team is great. Especially Bhairav who was very helpful in facilitating the spa/sauna services. I would definitely love to come back.  

They dried my clothes, provided towels and after shower amenities such as hair brush, dryer etc. Amazing service.","5","2022-06"
"Not 7 star after all","Our view was of their future resort under construction, did not receive 9 pillow selection as stated on website, AC not cold in room so we sweated all night long, night light next to bed was broken so it stayed on all night and I had to shove it behind curtain to stop light from shining in my eyes as I tried to sleep, requested fan but did not receive until 12:30 am when I requested again, requested electrical adapters so that I can utilize my American iPhone charger in their outlet but did not receive that until I Requested it again the next morning, in room dining orders were made incorrectly even though the orders are sent as a written text message directly to the E-Butler, they promote that you can have a bath drawn if you advise in 15 minutes prior, but on both occasions it took over an hour and the first time we requested it, they put it in the wrong bathroom. 
They charge for 7 star resort but provide typical 4 star service. ","2","2022-05"
"Exceptional Gift","A truly amazing and magical hotel on planet earth. Each and every detail, service, person, here is exceptional. You have to experience it once while in Dubai. Could be a restaurant, could be just a tea at its rooftop lounge. It will leave you in awe of life","5","2022-02"
"The Best Hotel Experience Ever","Worth spending as everything are incomparable.  From food, staff, place, cleanliness, ease of access, amenities.... all are exemplary.  The supplies/ consumables are of highest standard especially the toiletries.","5","2022-05"
"Luxury to another level","Magnificent views and very courteous staff. Everyone is willing to go that extra mile to make the experience special for  the guests. The gold cappuccino was the highlight :) don’t forget to enjoy the lobby and picturesque views from the spa and indoor swimming pool.","5","2022-01"
"Wonderful lunch","Fantastic food, great service  in wonderful surroundings! I have particular dietary needs and they ensure my needs were catered for. I have to say I was surprised at the generous portions. My husband and I was so full, we could barely walk! I would not hesitate to recommend this place.","5","2022-05"
"An awesome experience from the get go😍🥳","Right from being greeted by the very well mannered doorman, Sammy, to checking in with so much ease with the help of Carmen at the reception , my stay in the deluxe suite with Kevin my day butler(my favorite) and Hitesh the night butler was an absolute delight.

Kevin was super helpful with organization and very much proactive. An excellent service provider by all standards.

The facilities here are endless. It’s like new surprises popping up on you each time. Most definitely worth every penny spent.

To crown it all, Ms. Cora at the Talise spa gave me the most relaxing massage I’ve ever had.

This review will not be complete without another mention of how great of help Sammy the doorman, was to us, every time we had to leave, while leaving and on returning to the hotel; every single day.

There’s so much to say but all in all, just like it’s “7 star accreditation” I give Burj Al Arab a 15/10! 😅😅😅","5","2022-05"
"The iconic and only 7 star hotel in the world","Burj Al Arab is an iconic landmark of Dubai.  The interior inside is gilded in 24 carat gold leaf. A redefined luxury, You can discover the untold stories of the worlds 7 star hotel to an exclusive 90 minute tour to which they recently open to the public late December 2021.","5","2022-01"
"Woahhhh 👍👍👍👍👍","How do you review extraordinary? How do you speak about 5***** staff (Carmen Barbera our welcoming Head Committee/ Hannah our ‘private butler’ / Achol Mordichi and Sami Mogamed our door concierge/ Morning Breakfast Staff -too many to name: but you were ALL unbelievable)

How do you review extraordinary food ?

How do talk about hospitality as a whole?

If I were the CEO of this hotel, I’d open a school for less trained staff and show them what 5******** hospitality is all about.  

Thank you for making our 35th wedding anniversary a grand celebration. Thank you for the cake, chocolates, fresh fruit etc. we found at our arrival. 

We met wonderful staff from all over the world and to ALL OF THEM: 

Merci. Thank you. Grazie. Gracias. Salamat. Asante.  شكرا

"Amazing experience","I rate my experience 5 out of 5. It was a unforgettable experience ever! The service, the food, the view and so on, everything here are amazing. I also meet some really nice staff in the swimming pool who are Jayson and Cristina, they are very enthusiastic and kind to communicate and offer nice service to me.","5","2022-05"
"Back To It’s Best","12 fantastic days and nights. The Burj surpasses all expectations, nothing too much trouble. Service, room, food,  front of house exceptional. So much choice in Dubai but this hotel still for us gives the privacy and respect that has yet to be matched by any other. We have in recent years been at the Four Seasons , The Mandarin, The One and Only The Palm, and Bulgari but The Burj still pips them all. The deck at The Burj adds that extra touch we love. Special mention to Simona Batista front of house Manager and our butler Sanjay ( floor 16) both amazing advocates for the Jumeirah group","5","2022-05"
"It was very beautiful","I had a wonderful time staying there and it was so beautiful that I never wanted to leave. Enjoy the service the pool was amazing the rooms are so beautiful that will take your breath away I will come there over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again lol ","5","2022-05"
"Visiting Burj al Arab and the Art Maze Exhibition","We would like to thank you very much for the wonderful time we had during the Art Maze exhibition at Burj al Aarb. Rarely have we felt so comfortable and so welcome as in this unique hotel and its attentive staff. Our very special thanks go to Mr. Farhan and his team who provided us with such delicious food and made this event even more unforgettable. 
The Art Maze exhibition was an experience of a unique kind and the Burj al Arab was a perfect host and a more than impressive venue for it. Thank you Mr. Farhan, thank you team, thank you Markus Schäfer and thank you Sacha Jafri. The pictures are unbelievably great. 

We will be happy to come again.","5","2022-03"
"I recommend it 100% to go with children","It is a well-known hotel throughout the world, due to its curious shape that reminds one of a sailboat. The entrance is super spectacular. 

It is designed with an Arabic style, but it still has its modern side. It has a lot of things made only with gold, and there are a lot of floors. You have from rooms with butler included, and normal rooms like any other hotel. 

It has several restaurants, but the most impressive is the one where you eat dinner with an aquarium full of marine animals next to it. It is super nice and impressive to see the fish swimming while you enjoy a good meal. 

In addition, it has several swimming pools, some only for adults and others for the families with kids. It has stores inside the hotel like Gucci, in case you have left your swimsuit at home. Not only that, the Burj Al Arab belongs to the Jumeirah hotel chain, so guests have the right to all the facilities of the four other Jumeirah resorts of the complex. Even if it costs a little more, I recommend this hotel because for a little more you get a lot! 

So in case you still doubt it, I recommend it 100% to go with children.","5","2022-02"
"Amazing","Wow amazing hotel!! Staff were exemplary. House keeping spot on, our suite was immaculate. Our butler was fantastic, helping me with something I’d left at home as well as general information and restaurant reservations. 
Sal restaurant was superb, food was the best we’ve ever had in Dubai and the setting, just beautiful. The Sal beach club vibe is fab, just perfect with a sophisticated feel, for those of us not into the whole Ibiza type scene! 
The Burj infinity pool is just something else, absolutely stunning. Can’t wait to return to this beautiful hotel!","5","2022-05"
"Perfect hotel","It was the best hotel I have ever been to I would 100% recommend it. The staff was amazing the food was great and views were spectacular. We achieved so many things during the trip because it was easy to get around. With all this it was the best hotel I have ever been to.","5","2021-06"
"Amazing hotel with very professional and kind staff","The hotel offers an excellent service, stunning swimming pool views and delicious food in Sal restaurant.
i would like to highlight our butler Omar for the moroccan hospitality we got from him and the amazing service that made us truly not feel but be home away from home. 
we spend 3 nights and turns out it was not enough after we moved to another hotel  so we had a plan of spending a day at Burj al Arab pool was a bit of a challenge with the booking and my husband had the idea of contacting our butler Omar and was a brilliant one. 
he had it all set for us within minutes we were 10 people so he offered us to take luxury cabanas and even came down to check on us and introduced us to Rashid from Sal who helped a lot with nice food recommendations.
Thank you to everyone at burj al arab hotel for this experience and specially Omar we already miss you and we look forward to see you in the next holidays

Meriem Lebbar and family.","5","2022-03"

"Wow wow wow","Opulence is an understatement.this place is nsnufucent in its rooms, the view, friendly staff.  Yes it’s expensive but we’ll worth it. Gold cappuccino is a must and yes it is expensive at $120 Dirham… but no where else will you get it","5","2022-05"
"Cream of the crop!","Had the opportunity to stay at the Burj al Arab this week. A very nice property. The accommodations were beyond first class as well as the staff. A very attentive team who does not let a minute go by without making you feel comfortable and appreciated.
Also while there; Enjoyed The Muntaha French restaurant on its 27th floor. The view was spectacular, the Chef Selection menu was a great gastro experience and the wait staff again very attentive. 

Would not hesitate to stay here again and it has opened my eyes to trying other Jumeirah properties in Dubai and around the world!","5","2022-05"
"Lovely place for vacation","Had a lovely time. The hotel was home away from 
Home . Staff were friendly and courteous . Breakfast was also good. They would need to wash the bath tubs better and cleaner. The pillows were too soft.","5","2022-05"
"Beyond Clouds Experience.","What a experience.  Mind blowing,  extraordinary. Such a warm welcome and services. Truly it's must take journey you have to take. The all process before you start your session is propery manage by them. Specially thanks to Mr. Bhairav.","5","2022-05"
"Highly rated,Great Place and exquisite  service ❤️","2 days ago I booked at sahn eddar lobby lounge to try snacks and desserts. It was a great experience since Mr Sergey assisted our table and offered us a great option of dessert and tea. Staffs are so friendly it was a great experience for us. We were warmly greeted by butler Anthony and showed us around the hotel. Stunning facilities of the hotel and such a luxury experience. Definitely be back soon❤️","5","2022-05"
"Changing but not for the better....","I  will just start by saying we love the BAA and having being staying here for over 15 years and made our first post COVID stay in April.

Hotel standards were up to the usual high standards but the big let down was at the SAL Pool terrace.
As anyone can now purchase a relatively cheap day pass for AED800 with 50% of that being able to be used as credit for food the SAL pool club now produce a clientele more appropriate to the likes of a Nikki Beach, Ocean club etc. which I am not against in the right setting..... but this is supposed to be an exclusive 7 Star hotel in which we pay quite a lot for the privilege??? Now its seems its just for the gram and to pick up girls/guys.

The Bulgari etc. now seem the better option for people wanting great service and exclusivity which is a shame a the BAA was always the best.

","3","2022-04"
"Good massage but not clean place !","Great place for relaxing ( the spa ) but not so clean 
There are million of comments on the cleaning 

The spa pool was not in control people was vaping on the indoor pool 

The toilet was not clean 
Hair was in the shower 
Not clean flooring in the shower and the steam room 
Place was slippery in the Jacuzzi area 

The message experience  was good with no comment on that","2","2022-05"
"A truly exceptional hotel","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab in December for the second year running and again they surpassed all our expectations. 

This hotel really is outstanding - the rooms, the pool area, the service! From the moment you wake up to go to breakfast on the beautiful outside terrace to the days end round the poolside, you are treated like royalty.

All food and drinks are of the highest quality. We took a visit to Gilt one night and it was a really enjoyable night. A DJ, good music and amazing cocktails and food.

Thank you to our superb butler Omar but we have to say a very special thanks to Simone Battista who made our trip really special with her outstanding service, an example of why this hotel is as iconic as it is. Thank you again.","5","2021-12"
"Stay of a lifetime ","We stayed 10 days at the Burj al Arab and it was a dream stay. I can confidently say it was the best stay of our life. We were treated so well from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out. A lot of people made our stay special…but Anthony, our butler, took it to the next level. Nothing was too much for him, he was always there when we needed him and he never missed a beat. Anthony is a huge reason we will absolutely be back! Make sure you get a massage during your stay—it’s well worth it. The Burj Al Arab missed no details—You won’t be disappointed!

Thank you Anthony! Thank you Burj Al Arab staff! Can’t wait to return 
","5","2022-02"
"Impressive...if you have the money","My husband and myself made reservations in advance for Al Iwan. Upon arrival we were told that our table would be delayed as guests find it difficult to keep to timed reservations...something us Brits are not used to. We were shown around the corner to a lounge area and given free champagne and canapés by way of an apology - which was most appreciated.
Something to remember is this is a 7 star exclusive hotel, something we are not used to. We we shown to our table around 30mins later than scheduled, seated and advised of how the Ramadan buffet was laid out. We were asked if we would like any drinks, and when asking for the cocktail menu was simply asked what my favourite cocktail was and they would make it for me...something I am not accustom too as I normally like to price things up, but price was not discussed...something I'm sure regular clientele are more used to than me.
The buffet was incredible, as was the service from every member of staff. Would highly recommend if you have the money to spare.","4","2022-04"

"Exceptional service at the Burj Al Arab my husband who is terminally ill was cared for during our stay like family.","The butler checked in on him whilst we went out for  dinner.
Nothing was too much trouble for anyone at the hotel, which made our stay unique considering our family circumstances.

Overall cannot wait to return. Thanks to the staff.","5","2022-04"
"Al Mahara Seafood Restaurant","I had dinner at Al Mahara Seafood restaurant at Burj Al Arab.. putting aside the mesmerizing Architecture and the delicious Food, I want to emphasize on the memorable experience I had because of Noeimi, Farhan and Frederico who took special care of me out of their kind, thoughtful, appreciative, humble, fun and professional selves!

"A dream time in Burj Al Arab","""A dream from arrival to departure!""
Easy Check-In, personal welcome, Arab-tea.
After ca. 45 minutes of waiting (with a drink on 1st floor) getting the keys and tour of the room - we were blown away ! Room on 2 floors - groundfloor with a bathroom, office, bar, living room and a 2nd living room and a large table for 10 people, incl a kitchen (probably nobody ever used it...) - second floor the bedroom with great view to the sea and the cunstruction of a new hughe Hotel-complex, a bath with everything you can imagine, plus a room for the lady with a large amount of clothes boxes.
Visiting the fantastic Spa-area, then the outside area with infinity pool and shopping-shop - walking around the Hotel to make pictures from the outside, all directions.
Dinner on the 27th floor, stylish, many very friendly waiters, speaking different languages, helpt to select incl. an amazing cheese-buffet for dessert.
Yes, prices in the Restaurant are high, especially for the drinks..., but, once in a life-time - and to make the wife happy, worth every cent.
Great bed, short night, ready for the Breakfast outside with a buffet that was greatly presented, all was always available, people who did help, who served the stuff you do not get from the buffet... as good experience as the Dinner the night before.
All in all an experience we'll never forget, and we talke about it since.
Fantastic people working there with a perfect sense to serve the guests - all was clean and nicely presented - we felt really like their guests !
Many thanks to the entire Burj Al Arab team !","5","2022-01"
"A beyond expectation experience","First time stayed at the hotel and wow it really does it’s job of maintaining the level of service, restaurants and room quality that you still rarely find at this level.
Great beach club and amenities.","5","2022-04"
"An experience to remember!","So, after a Year of COVID and not being able to travel, we decided to treat ourselves to a staycation at the Burj.

We stayed in the Deluxe Marina suite (which is the base room category, with slightly different views). This was to avoid the views of the work being carried out on another hotel.

The rooms are unbelievable. Two floors, with a winding staircase. Superb views and amenities. There was some treats on arrival and our children got cookies throughout the day.

We spent most of our time on the infinity pool that overlooks the sea. This pool is amazing and one of the nicest pools we have been in. However, be warned: children under 12 are not allowed int his pool and it definitely has a more adult feel to it (no splashing or shouting etc.). We spent almost our whole first day in the pool and watched the amazing sunset. The staff around the pool were superb and extremely attentive.

We made use of the Wild Wadi access and used the golf cart to take us there. the kids have been numerous times before and love it here. It also helps to break up the day.

Our room service was superb with the room being cleaned multiple times.

Some points: we visited in Summer '21. It was extremely quiet so we pretty much had the place to ourselves: which was great. However, I could imagine the front pool being very crowded.

The breakfast was superb. The best breakfast I have had at any hotel and was a highlight of our stay!","5","2021-08"
"The Best","This hotel has lived to its name , Luxurious, Elegant and Prestige. As soon as you step into the doors of Burj Al Arab , you are instantly made to feel part of Royal family.

Whilst they do not hide around on magic entrance  , you instantly feel the magic happening around you than any other hotel we have ever visited .

Warm welcome from receptionist Daniel who ensured we had a smooth check in , something that we have never experienced before .

The two storey room was extremely huge with out of the world views especially at night and not forgetting how  beautiful our  anniversary surprise was .  The bed , pillows , everything around just feels so comfortable. 

Food from Al Mahara and Al Muntaha were somehow overpriced but didn't bother us. Breakfast was amazing and can't have enough of it .

Even though we only stayed for 2 nights , we already have plans of coming back .

Thank you to the professional yet friendly team who took extreme care of us . Special thanks to Daniel,  Willy and our butlers Rhoda and Sanjay who we couldn't have done it without them .

Looking forward to our return.","5","2022-02"
"Perfection","Our time and visit here has been amazing we are only two days into our stay here and we cannot wait to see what the next five days brings. The service and the atmosphere second mum and the welcome that we have received has been beyond anything we might have expected.","5","2022-04"
"Superb location, average food","The place is magnificent so as the suites, they are simply beautiful. The staff is warm and willing to provide amazing service. 
For lunch, “Sal” has a beautiful atmosphere, you’ll feel like you’re in Ibiza, have the salted sea bass, it’s really good, but skip the pasta with pesto and crab. 
If you plan to dine in, their restaurants have a beautiful atmosphere and really good service, however the culinary offer lacks originality, quality and taste, after dining at the Italian/french restaurant at the top and at the seafood Italian which has the aquarium next to the lobby, I can say that at least those two options does not match the quality of the overall experience. 
May be I just had bad luck, but is true that when I checked out they did not even took note on my comments, which seemed a bit arrogant, but who knows, it’s only my perception.","4","2022-03"
"Best Hotel in the world","You can find many other 5-star hotels around the world, but none have exceptional customer service like the Burj Al Arab.
We celebrated my daughter's birthday and this was the best experience we have ever had. From our butler Aldrin and Eve who were amazing, Belair who served us the Arabic coffee every day, to Simona Batista the customer service manager, I have no words to express how we felt, it was like we were at home, the experience . welcome and departure was amazing we left with tears in our eyes  missing how they  pampering  us and how much fun we had.","5","2022-03"
"The Epitome Of Luxury","This is by far the first hotel that consistently made you feel welcome, valued and respected from the time you walked all the way up-to the time you left! 

There was no waiting around at any point. Service was extremely prompt! The staff impeccably dressed and carried them selves with so much poise and knowledge. The location, fantastic and private. The suites were spacious, comfortable and full of light! 

Every single restaurant we patronized was a delight! The Food and drinks gastronomic and fresh. The variety was just amazing! 

The gold cappuccino is a MUST try!!!! Don’t forget to enjoy the lobby music and picturesque views from the spa and indoor swimming pool.","5","2021-11"
"Most of them were good.","Everything was fine. Except for two things. Butler wasn’t where I was. As soon as I entered the room, I saw moldy grapes. I plan to visit with my friend next time.I wish I had fresh fruit instead of moldy grapes.","4","2022-03"
"Blissful honeymoon","Our stay here was exceptional. Beyond the exquisite decor, the service was worth every dirham spent!  The gentleman that greeted us multiple times daily were a special treat. Especially Willis, Alchol and the entire crew were delightful, helpful and they made us feel warmly welcome with every exit and return. Our initial butler, Koko, was also charming and highly responsive We confidently recommend this hotel for a once in a lifetime 7-star experience.","5","2022-03"
"Stunning & Amazing","Recently returned from a 3 night stay, to celebrate my husbands 60 th.
It was amazing, firstly from the spectacular sight of the Burj & the whole experience we
enjoyed.
The room was stunning, a really friendly, courteous & helpful butler.
Daslat  ( apologies if not spelt correct ) , on the 2 nd floor.
Breakfast, luxurious with ample choices. The evening restaurants, were superb.
We had a few hours on the private beach, so relaxing, 
Also, snatched a few hours at the Expo. 
I really appreciated the staff, on the whole of the Burj , experience.
Allways polite & extremely helpful without being overbearing.
My only regret is not staying a few more nights, to experience more of this 
Wonderful hotel. 
Many thanks to you all, you were all ******* to us both.
Hopefully we will manage a return visit, one day.","5","2022-03"
"Superb","The best and most luxurious hotel. The service was impeccable. The two story suites were absolutely beautiful and spacious. 
The infinity pool amazing, however it only opened until 6pm. I wish they open a bit longer. 
We had the best seabass at the SAL restaurant! 
We will definitely go back!!! ","5","2022-03"
"Excellent","What can I say? Everything was perfect… the place… the outdoor… the view…. The service.
I was there with my family and we all enjoyed the stay. Recommend to persons who are looking for a relaxing break","5","2021-10"
"Moving Back In The Right Direction","Last October (2021) we experienced a shocking 7 days stay which was heart-breaking considering we had been visiting the Burj for 16 years. 
We planned and vowed to never return, however, Mr Zanini the Regional Vice President who called me to discuss our experience and the tireless work of Melanie the Front Desk Manager encouraged us to return to give the hotel one more chance.
So, we have just returned from another 7-day visit, and we have to give credit where credit is due, Mr Zanini and his team have addressed some of the service standard issues we had previously experienced, and there was a marked improvement in our overall experience. 
The standard of the personal butler service was truly outstanding, Sanjay who was our butler last time went out of his way to check on us, and made sure we were ok, and our butler this time round Omar was truly world class, his attention to detail, and his genuine care and consideration was outstanding, he is a credit to your operation. We also want to praise Houdha who was very charming. 
Our breakfast experience was always enjoyable thanks to Sanjib who always was willing to help, and his manner and approach was a lovely way to start every morning. 
On the north deck we were always looked after by Moses who is outstanding at his job, and the truly brilliant Tiago who went out of his way to not only look after us but made us feel very special whilst on the North Deck. 
We popped over to the Summersalt Beach Club to use the pool, and to have dinner. As last time Hubert and Mark are the standard bearers in terms of service standards and 2 of the nicest people you would ever wish to meet. They are both truly talented individuals, and are a huge value add to the Jumeirah group. 
The Burj still has a little way to go to reach the heights they previously had, a prime example is the e-butler service, a service which is totally not fit for purpose and is damaging the service reputation of this hotel, you need to find a balance between cost cutting, and the dropping of service standards. The personal butler service made you stand out, the e-butler is a robot. 
When making requests we had to chase for a response, and sometime requests were just ignored, however, the most damaging element and the best example of its failings was when I fell over and damaged my back whilst in the Madinat. I needed urgent assistance so reached out to the e-butler to request someone from the hotel come and get me as I could not walk, what I received was a number of robotic responses, and miss information, and one message asking me if I was in a buggy on my way back to the hotel. A waiter in the restaurant we were in (Anar) called the Burj 4 times to explain the urgency only to be told firstly someone was there, and then to be told 30 mins later someone was on their way! in total it took almost 60 mins before I was attended to and returned to our suite. Once I was back Omar and the paramedic looked after me very well. 
On our last evening we requested the final bill to be sent to us as we had an early start so wanted to settle the bill. It turned out that there was a £300 meal in SAL associated to our suite which we never consumed, so we raised it and requested a new bill, only to be told we had to wait for the manager at SAL to confirm it was an error and they were busy, well that was good enough considering it was 2230 in the evening. It was only when Omar took control of the situation and got things sorted that we were able to go to sleep, we later discovered that the reason the bill could not be changed was because there were no managers around to authorise the change. 
We also noticed the rooms were not as clean as they should be after cleaning, we found stains on the bathroom floor and small elements of dirt on the carpet. However, we also had a day when the room was not cleaned at all. 
I hope the Burj can address these concerns as it will help smooth out some of the weaknesses that still seem to be there. 
Melanie, the Front Desk Manager is someone who will go all the way to the top in this industry, a true talent, a lovely person, and brilliant at her job.  
I am sure in the hands of Mr Zanini, the property will slowly get to the top again, and want to thank him for inviting us back, our overall experience was good. 
I hope an operational review of the e-butler happens soon. As what happened to me when I fell over left me frustrated, in pain and disappointed. The foundation of great service is the small touches, and simple gestures, from there you can re-build the castle. 
Congratulations to everyone who has made efforts to improve from last year, there was a marked improvement.","4","2022-03"
"The best place in the world, not only Dubai","This is the second year when me and my boyfriend go to Burj Al Arab, i just arrive home and planning the next vacation. I can’t find even one small thing that i did not like, everything was perfect. My favorite thing was the E-Butler service that allows you to get assisted via whatssap with anything you need, from reservations to pharmacy things. I meet the most amazing staff there who made me fell special and put a smile on my face everyday. I higly recomend this hotel, from my visits around the world i never enjoyed a place like that. Before i left, 2 amazing girls brought me flowers and a hand written letter with cut out emoji’s from our conversations on whatsapp 
Tell me who can do better that that?
Thank you Burj Al Arab and see you soon","5","2022-03"
"Most Luxurious Stay !","If 7 Star category exist this hotel should be rated as 7 Star hotel. Whatever you can dream off. It’s available at this hotel from helipad to fleet of Rolls Royce. World class restaurants with incredible wine & champagne offerings to high security. Butler service is amazing. Spa is among the best in the world. In room amenities are superb . Toiletries are super luxurious. No wonder this hotel is ranked among world’s most expensive hotel. Must experience once in lifetime .","5","2021-10"
"NIKHIL BAJAJ ~ BURJ AL ARAB","BURJ AL ARAB  provides us the  great hospitality. Mr. NIKHIL BAJAJ  is very helpful and guided us throughout our stay.  His determination towards his work is outstanding and even he take care of us during our stay. Most passionate and hardworking person Burj Al Arab has !!","5","2022-02"
"Great spa staff","Had an amazing experience at the talise spa
Special mention for bhairav for his kind attentions and professionalism, been coming here for many years never been disappointed.
Loved the iced cold bath right after the hammam.","5","2022-03"
"Bucket list item","Stayed here 4 nights for a visit to Dubai from California with my significant other. Top hotel experience in the world bar none. 
They overstaff the hotel to ensure guests are taken care of to the brim - they will be all over you and if you enjoy that like we do, the experience is top notch
Suites are spacious and opulent with full size Hermes kits definitely a highlight 
Extremely clean hotel in every aspect
We ate at SAL poolside multiple times, great pool butler service and delicious food, room service was top notch - especially caviar service, and GILT is a must for pre dinner or post dinner drinks 
The staff from the bellmen to the waiters and butlers are all committed to ensuring you have a great stay 
Highlight of the trip was Omar our butler who stopped at nothing to make our experience memorable 
Rishav at breakfast was wonderful 
I paid $1400 a night and found this to be tremendous cost to value/experience ratio. They shower you with a world class breakfast in the morning and offer you hors doeuvees and drinks throughout the day. You also have privileged access  across the jumeirah hotel complex
Bucket list hotel stay","5","2022-03"
"Abeer and team, thank u for an amazing spa experience","This was the best spa experience I ever had, Abeer the spa manager planned this amazing spa for us. We were amazing welcomed by the team and had our lovely tour of the facility and was taken to the treatment where I personally had a well experienced Masseuse called Dada. I loved the attention to details in every step from selecting my Oil to scrubbing my feet before the treatment and finally indulging the best ginger and lemon tea with dates. Everyone one at the Burj was more than hospitable staring from the entrance staff to the pool guard Elizabeth. I promise all visitors to get the return of their investment in this spa and assure you the quality and experience u will get her. Can’t wait for my next trip. Thank u Abeer, Dada and Lani","5","2022-03"
"Fancy Schmancy.... But a Little Bit...","We stayed here a couple nights just before New Years. It's an iconic hotel and one of the first hotels to put Dubai on the map. I stayed here about 13 years ago and it looks nearly the same. It is a very well maintained hotel.

THE PROS: Iconic hotel with excellent security measures and privacy. Huge double storey suites. Complimentary Hermes toiletries in full sizes including perfumes. Luxurious towels. Complimentary desserts and water. A luxury suite with the most comfortable beds. Breakfast views are lovely outside. Received an early check-in with Hassan at front desk which I appreciated, and despite being new, he was very efficient and quick with the check-in as we were tired from our long flight.

The Cons: No windows. I am just not a fan of hotels with no windows, but luckily the rooms are enormous that it doesn't feel claustrophobic. Too big a hotel to give customised service. In fact, the first time I visited the service was much better. I recall that for check-in they used to sit you down and offer you water and dates, with no need to stand at the counter like at a Hilton hotel. I think they changed the hotel policy over the years and I think they should change it back to reflect the level of the hotel and the culture. It's out of the area with nothing to do there, which means you have to drive in and out and the hotel is quite boring unless you just want to chill at the pool and wonder about the connecting resort.

It's an elitist hotel, very showy, a bit fancy schmancy. It is 5-stars, but I prefer more boutique-style luxury hotels.","5","2021-12"
"Has lost its shine","After the first experience of some years ago we decided to come for a second time because this place was perfect in all respects.

Unfortunately we noticed that the hotel, except the look, is not the same as our memories.

Food quality, in different restaurants, is still very high.

The service in general, from our “butler” to restaurants or pool area, is a total disater: full of mistakes, delays and disorganization.
The concierge at our floor was always absent.

The poolside area is full of daybeds completely squeezed between them, like a medium/low level Ibiza-style hotel. Unacceptable for a 7star.

Also the rooms, after some years, need a refresh on furniture and accessories.

The hotel allows people (not guests) to enter for tours, drink at the bars, eat at the restaurants and chill at the pool, I understand the business side but this shouldn’t affects the quality of the stay of the guests which are paying so much money looking for something exclusive.

For sure not suggested anymore; world is going forward, Burj Al Arab backward.","3","2022-03"
"Not as good as other 5 star hotels","Disappointing. This hotel’s service is very inconsistent. The reception person who escorted us to our room was so slick that it left a bad impression. We had an upgrade included in our Deluxe room but they placed us in the lowest (2nd floor) floor with an obstructed view while paying nearly $2000 per night. He made it sound as if this was a great room because of absurd reasons that insulted our intelligence. 
The butlers were fine but they didn’t communicate to one had no record of me scheduling Covid testing with the other butler previously. It would have been a problem if we didn’t double check. 
The concierge was helpful but told me we didn’t need reservations for visiting Burg Khalifa at the 124th floor. When we got there at 4 pm they were booked until 9 pm and we were unable to visit the site. 
We asked for the room to be cleaned prior to leaving the hotel for the day. When we returned 5 hours later, they were in the midst of cleaning the room as they just got there. 
All these do not amount to much but certainly do not meet the standards that I have experienced from other 5 star hotels around the world. Their claim of 7 stars is ridiculous. The service did not compare to our stay earlier on this trip at the Waldorf Astoria Maldives. 
We will not return.","3","2022-03"
"A wonderful evening","Amazing service and attention from Farhan and his staff. Very good bites and a wonderful view over Dubai. We where attending the vernissage at Galleria Continua, the italian artist Loris Cecchini and the following outdoor party","5","2022-03"
"It was PERFECT, I would rate them 7 Starts if possible","I must say that I have had the fortune of staying in many fine properties across the world, but the Burj really exceeded my expectations and I would give them 7 Stars if possible, the best of the best, always going beyond, caring for the details and offering the best service possible while keeping a warm and welcoming environment.  We went to Dubai to celebrate our Daughter's birthday... The Suites have a personal Butler service, in our case it was Jaffar, who was always attentive to the ultimate details,  they brought a fabulous cake and a serenade for our daughter, just amazing.  The pool area is relaxing, and beautiful, the private beach and the spa are amazing.    We had excellent food everywhere including in the Beach (Peruvian Ceviche!) and in the Pool (Even Spanish Croquetas!).   Do not miss the sunset in the UMA bar, with a wonderful drink prepared by George and his team.   The Hotel GM, Mr. Zannini, invited us for Cocktails and Canapes... At the Beach club, everybody was attentive to provide us the best experience ever.  I have NO complains at all, really outstanding.  They have free valet parking, so you can rent your car and be free or you can use the fantastic limos they have...    I will definitely come back.   Congratulations Mr. Zannini and team,  you got a new Jumeriah fan...","5","2022-02"
"A beautiful experience","I was so happily impressed by the excellent service from my head waiter Peter Chan. He was warm, attentive and 100% professional. He made the evening special. The food and wine he recommended pared up nicely. The fish was super fresh. The sorbet he brought to me was a wonder. If you ever get to dine at Burj Al Arab, ask for Peter. He would complete your day.","4","2022-03"

We will come back for sure.","5","2022-03"
"Everything perfect","It’s two years that I’m a regular customer of this hotel, and i noted that every time they are able to add something more to what was almost perfect. The way the staff took  care of me it’s really unbelievable and made me feel u special. The new restaurant Olivo is one of the best at the moment in town and the service absolutely the best found during the week.
I think the management of the hotel in the last two years, turn really the Burje Al Arab in what a seven stars hotel should be.","5","2022-02"
"Amazing Place","Stayed here for a couple of nights with my wife and son. Was upgraded to Seaview on the 24th floor. The room was outstanding and huge over 2 floors. It was my wife's birthday so there was a bottle of champagne,chocolates and flowers in the room. All staff were very nice. Butler was great. Breakfast was superb. We loved our stay. The finish in the hotel is superb and you have to see it in person to believe it. Pool area is lovely. Wild wadi water park is free. All in all,we'll never forget our stay and it was a privilege to stay here. A big thankyou to Burj Al Arab.","5","2022-02"
"excellent service","We have 12 people stayed in this hotel. The service was excellent. We have been traveled a lot of places. This hotel so far is the best one. We wanted to  put our luggage in the hotel in morning and visited somewhere. Since we arrived earlier, our rooms were not ready yet. The hotel offered us free breakfast as a apology.  It was not their problem at all. 
The staff is well trained. We cannot get help when we wanted. Some staff was not supposed to take things that we wanted, but they offered help anyway. 
We will come back for sure.","5","2022-02"
"One of it's kind!!!","Brilliant architecture, a very open atrium that gives you a touch of freedom from the moment you leave your suite.

A luxury service, with a butler serving you delicacies and drinks in the evening and doing all your bookings and plannings a special thank to Mr. Omar our butler. It is just amazing how the staff are so well trained and current about every small detail of the city and the hotel itself.

An absolute icon, a 7 star service always exeeding expectations no matter how high it is.

"The best hotel I have ever been to!!!","Absolutely first class, lived up to the hype and delivered even more.  The building itself is an amazing  site.  One can see it from a couple of miles away driving in from the airport.  Security is very tight so the resort is completely safe.  First class and seamless check-in right to our suite.  The suite was absolutely magical.  My wife and kids were amazed as was I.  We did it all there, beach, pool, in room dining, fine dining.  The staff could not do enough.  Every little detail was important.  I will be back as soon as possible.  My compliments to the staff and the UAE for a first class experience.","5","2022-02"

Burj Al Arab when I visit him it was not hotel that it It was a masterpiece. It was an icon on the seashore.
It is not enough from the outside only, but when you go inside, it is a second world, a world of luxury from civilization. It talks about everything, about the icon of engineering, about the decoration, about the royal suite, about the royal costumes","5","2022-02"

"The perfect place to stay and relax in the 7 🌟of world","After having toured the UAE for over a month, we decided to finish our trip with a week at the Burj Al Arab.

After having passed security, you will be driving on a bridge up to the hotel, where you will be directly taken in charge by the valet and the front desk team. The outside and inside architecture is just amazing. 

The front desk team directly recognized that we were French and took the initiative to speak French with us. This was highly appreciated. We arrived early and our high floor panoramic suite was not ready. We were therefore invited to have some refreshment at the lobby’s restaurant.

After some times, our Buttler arrived and invited us to follow him to our suite. The room is amazing: tremendous views, high ceilings, nice dining/living area, comfortable bathroom with jetted bathtub and a lot of Hermes amenities (full size parfum bottle for me and my husband, along with some other beauty amenities). The slippers available in the room were too small. We asked for bigger sizes. This was not a problem for our Buttler, who brought us new ones.

We tried the hotel’s room service. The menu offered a large choice for everyone, even for me - vegetarian. The food was good and fresh. We loved the truffle pasta and truffle pizza. The arabic selection was amazing too.

Each afternoon, our Buttler brought us small appetizers. These were the perfect start before enjoying one of the hotel’s restaurant.

The beach/pool area is really nice. We enjoyed seeing the sunset while having a shisha and drinking a cocktail. Simple luxury with some music. So romantic…

Breakfast is offered on the terrace. The buffet choice is not huge but it had some highlights for my husband: chocolate fountain, candy bar, aso. You can order a large variety of made to order dishes. The staff is at your service.

As a guest of the Burj Al Arab, you have complimentary access to the wadi water parc, a few steps away from the hotel. Golf cart drivers drive you to the entrance, where you can directly enjoy water slides and more. A nice way to spend a day and have fun.

Our Buttler organized us a hotel tour. We could visit the royal suite along with a small museum about the hotel and all the special events that happened there. A nice way to explore what the Burj Al Arab has to offer!

We really had a nice stay. Friendly and dedicated staff, good food, relaxing getaways, aso. The only point that was a bit under our expectations was the mattress and the pillows (even though there are plenty of pillow choices). I have some neck/back problems and I am kind of problematic with that.

Burj Al Arab exceeds in providing luxury without the boring things that might come along luxury: no stuffy behaviors. Guests feel simplicity while everything is well managed behind the scene. You really feel like home while being in one of the world’s most exclusive and amazing hotel. After having travelled in palaces around the world, we can definitely say that Burj Al Arab’s way of treating their guests is the height of luxury. We found our new home in Dubai and can’t wait to come back next time! Maybe after the planed works in 2023?","5","2022-02"
"Best hotel in the world.","We travel a lot and always choose to stay and really nice/highly rated hotels. We feel the success of vacation depends as much on the accommodations as it does the destination. So we decided to stay at Burj Al Arab. Simply stated, the best hotel/staff/concierge service we have ever experienced. Aside from that, we would come visit again just for that amazing breakfast. Truly great experience and I highly recommend it.  ","5","2022-02"
"Superb stay","Amazing stay with professional and super helpful staff , fast response , clean rooms , you felt recognized , people care you come again , food quality was top , may be one small thing the SAL by the pool was so crowded but this is out of the staffs hand ","5","2022-02"
"You HAVE to visit burj el arab, at least ONCE in your lifetime","All the (well known) superlatives on ""burj el arab"" are... true, and well-deserved. The architecture, the ""class"", the serviceability, the quality of the restaurant, the beauty of the location... 
You HAVE to visit burj el arab, at least ONCE in your lifetime","5","2022-02"
"Absolute best. Nothing compares. Nothing comes close to this.","Our second stay in a year and we cannot get enough of Burj Al Arab. No matter how many times you see it when you enter the bridge taking you to the private island your jaw will drop. Go to the pool and you can spend hours admiring this gorgeous hotel. And that view from the infinity pool. 

I am surprised reading some of the recent reviews. What are people expecting? Perfection from robots? Yes things can go wrong but there is enough talent in their team to make things right. Our knightess in shining armor was Melanie the front desk manager. We were in a tough spot through no fault of the hotel but she took it upon herself to turnaround our holiday. And everything changed within minutes. We got a fantastic room with a stunning view. 

I must also mention that lady who came to the room with that car with candies. My kids were beyond thrilled. 

The food and the service at the pool is also flawless. We missed Pavlos this time but Tiago made his presence felt and took good care. Love the tiramisu at Sal. And the lamp chops. Also the shisha is the best I ever had.

Perhaps the only thing that can be improved Is the coffee at breakfast. It’s different from the one served at the atrium lounge. 

We rarely ever return to the same hotel but the Burj is the only exception. I am a fan.","5","2022-02"
"Room with a sound","So this is the third time I'm staying at this hotel first 2 times were great but this time every morning at 6 am a noise starts to come as if someone is banging the windows I would be attaching the video as well. I called security called management everything nothing was done no one comes in a hotel to wake up at 6 am with some wierd noise. Honestly no one should be spending this amount of money at burj it has become more of a visiting place for people who want to click pictures rather than a peaceful stay. In addition to this the butlers are all now very inefficient I think they have kept trainees highly incapable and inefficient. Spoilt my entire stay and sleep with this wierd noise.","1","2022-02"
"Worst anniversary","15 years ago, I spend an awesome night at Burj al Arab with amazing service and very friendly staff at every time for a very good value for my money. The butler on my floor was reachable every time and I really enjoy my stay.
Now I would like to share this amazing experience with my wife for our anniversary on Valentine Day but nothing is like before.
After arrival we had to wait more than one hour for checkin close to 4pm. Nobody find us in the waiting area where they placed us. The staff changes every 30 minutes and no one knows what they colleagues done before.
The butler, who should stay in every floor, was rarely seen and difficult to reach. Completely different to my experiences 15 years ago. I even have to told, that I have to pay the triple price meanwhile, but the service are not the same like before.
15 years ago Dates and spicy pickles everywhere in the suite and fresh bruit tea offer an athmosphere like Storys of 1001 night. Later the day the butler comes with fresh and warm complimentary plum cake to our suite.
Nothing of them you can find now. By the way, meanwhile they served tea with teabags in a self called 7-star-Hotel.
Even shocking about guests in bathrobe coming to breakfast. 
I‘m not rich and have to work two weeks to spend one special anniversary night in this hotel. So I‘m even sad to Checkin late and checkout early. On my request they allowed to leave at noon, but most of the time I spend with arrangements for checkout. It was not clear when and where. On Jumeirah website they advertise with Checkin and Checkout on your own floor, but it was not possible. So they force us to do it at the reception in the main Lobby. Later, during changing my clothes I get one of many calls for payment of city tax and due to stress it comes to a misunderstanding.
To clear this I have to wait 20 minutes more at the reception of our butler who can’t help and so we wait for the staff which was gone for lunch.
15 years ago all this arranged our butler and  I had nothing to ask before. On the top he arranged a complimentary transfer to the next hotel in a Rolls Royce. Meanwhile they want 800 AED (200 Euro) for the 15 minutes trip.
Later for checkout we have to wait in front of the Burj 20 minutes to get our luggage after they already keep it before we leave.
I visit many luxury Hotels all over the world, but Burj al Arab is not the same like before.
Maybe you get a better service as a rich people with a longer stay. But this can’t be the right way.","3","2022-02"
"Honest review about treatment of guests","I don't set out to write scathing reviews, but here is a recap of our second stay at BAA. I will list pros that will be seen in nearly all reviews - great rooms, amazing location, attentive staff*, nice amenities. You feel like you're walking in to a world-class hotel. 

Upon our first sub-par stay, BAA generously offered us a discounted rate to return and give them another try. We came back in Feb 2022 after a stay in January. 

On Day 2 of our stay, our daughter's predeparture Covid test came back positive, which would be a nightmare in any scenario. By informing the hotel of this result, I expected most housekeeping services, etc to terminate. I did not expect the lack of care or disregard for our wellness that followed. 

>> For a time, hotel employees continued to come to try to enter the room, meaning there was a lack of internal communication among staffers.
>> Aside from one employee who called, there was no effort on behalf of the hotel to check on our wellbeing, or to see if there was anything we needed. This would have been something most two-star hotels would have at least done. 
>> While we were scrambling to make our arrangements, our request for late-check out was declined by the butler service, citing high occupancy (why they would attempt to put a covid+ room back into service same day is beyond me....). We eventually checked out late anyway, since we needed to make arrangements to safeguard everyone, and they probably did not want covid positive people running around their lobby.  
>> When we asked to have the breakfast (included in the rate) delivered to our room, we were told to just order private dining instead. As we enjoyed virtually none of the amenities at the hotel, I don't think it was too much of an ask to do deliver it to people who are isolating for others' protection. (they eventually did acquiesce to deliver it, but this should not have been something we needed to insist on)
>> When we inquired about how to protect others during our exit process, there was no real protocol.
>> Masking is not enforced. Ironically we were some of the few guests who were adhering to wearing masks everywhere, and were fully vaccinated and boosted. The disregard from some of the snobby guests you come to expect at hotels like BAA was disconcerting. 
>> The ventilation system in the bathrooms does not prevent cigarette smoke from coming through, so it is certainly not preventing any communicable or transmissible airborne viruses from spreading, either. 

The Burj al Arab is an icon. The hotel has great services and amenities. But their true colors were revealed when our moment of vulnerability came, and there was little care or concern for us, aside from getting us checked out of the hotel and on our way. I hope that anybody who has a Covid-19 positive test result does not learn of the test while staying at Burj al Arab.","1","2022-02"
"Just the best","This is one amazing place made all the better by our fantastic host. We spent several hours in the Sky View Bar to celebrate the end of a fantastic holiday. It was made all the better by Ciro. What a friendly and accommodating host. Professional and courteous. He truly made a memorable evening very special. Thank you so much 🙏","5","2022-02"

"Amazing..! The only 7 Stars Hotel in the world.","Luxury hotel, worth visiting. There are a few restaurants where you can try food from all over the world. Everything was absolutely perfect and professional. Staff couldn't do more to help us. Everything about the hotel was so good. The hotel is expensive but you must be prepared to this if you want to visit the only branded 7 stars hotel in the world. I highly recommend this place :)","5","2021-03"
"Wonderful stay in Dubai","We had a wonderful stay at Burj Al Arab. The rooms are beautiful and the service is wonderful. 

The restaurants are all exceptional. If you have time, enjoy a Cabana by the pool and afternoon tea in the atrium. Make sure to enjoy a Golden Cappuccino!","5","2022-02"
"Rinu Abraham","This is the best ever hotel I have stayed in. Got a free upgrade to higher floor and all the staffs including the personal butler's was very friendly and kept us very comfortable and gave us the best attention to every details and kept us relaxed in our stay. Will not forget my Anniversary experience with Burj Al Arab team","5","2022-02"
"Not really worth the hype","I requested special arrangements as it was my husband birthday was surprised that they didn't put my request down, also checking it and checking out was so unprofessional ans the staff was unfriendly. Moreover they took the amount twice from my account and when I contacted them they requested proof and hustled me till they fixed the issue!!! 7 stars not really","1","2022-01"
"Taking care of us","The people of the Burj al Arab has taken really good care of us. We had nothing to worrie about. The vibe at the pool is very nice, good music and good service. All the staff is so kind and nice. We loved our stay and hope to come back really soon.","5","2022-01"
"Great Scape with 7 star experiance","Great location, room size and layout, amenities and staff. We had a very good experience for our Anniversary celebration. The arrangements were very good. 
The food in SAL would be better compared to the value. 
Minibar could be included in the room package considering the room value and 7 star hotel level.

"Best Hotel In The World!","The nexus of the attentive staff, high level architecture, opulence, and cleanliness, made us feel like we were in a different world. If you can, stay at Burj Al Arab, it has more value for its money than any other hotel in the world.

"Arabic splendor","The decoration is magnificent at this hotel. Curves that are reminiscent of Arabic alphabets, space worthy of majesty and service that royalty would expect all add to a fine experience. The rooms may have multiple floors with ocean and sea views galore, comfortable bedding and life-sized mirrors in enchanting places. More exciting than I imagined","5","2022-01"
"3 days at The Burj","I took some friend to the Burg and we had 2 rooms for 3 days.  This was at the end of our 2 week trip to the UAE and just basically stayed on the property and relaxed.  The rooms are amazing and are very clean and well decorated.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly,  as was the service everywhere we went in the UAE.  The breakfast buffet and dinner at Sal was very good. We had dinner one night at Muntaha and it was very disappointing, not what we would expect from the restaurant on the 27th floor of The Burj. We complained about the dinner and all they said was sorry.
     I have traveled all over the world, 60 plus countries, and have elite status with Marriott Bonvoy.  This was my first time staying at a Jumeirah property and The Burj Al Arab is the crown jewel of all the Jumeirah Group properties. After I booked the rooms I was able to find the exact rooms and dates on another website and applied for a refund of the difference under the Best Price Guarantee.  To this day they have still not done anything.  They basically ignore you and hope you will just go away.  I even addressed this with the Assistant Front Office Manager when we got to the hotel.  He was very nice and said he would help me  but again my issue was not addressed and I was ignored. This is NOT 7 star service.  
     Overall we had a very nice time except for the bad meal at Muntaha and ignoring my issue kind of put a damper on the stay.","4","2021-07"
"Great to see","This is so great to see even from outside. Around the Burj Al Arab, the beach beauty is so good to see and enjoyable. One can have spend good amount of time by watching the beauty. You will remember the visit time lat long. We were with my friends and we enjoyed a lots.","5","2021-12"
"Must visit","This hotel is amazing, from the minute you check in which is not as a regular hotel, you get to sit down and wait for them to register all your information while some brings you water, our room wasn’t ready but they offered us to have some coffee on them on the second floor. They brought us to our room and showed the entire duplex, very clean, you find a nice tray of fruit at the table, selection of coffee and tea, and in the bathroom you’ll find Hermes soup, cream, perfume and cologne. We also visited the indoor and outdoor pool. The breakfast service and selection of food was great. 
We had dinner in Al Mahara and enjoyed it pretty much.","5","2022-01"
"Arrogant and poor treatment","This review is not about the hotel. 
This is about the treatment in the bar. 
Burj Al Arab is an amazing hotel with everything on offer.
On the terrace, there is an elegant bar that offers first class views of the Arabian Gulf. 
We drank champagne watching the sun set: amazing!

However, treatment was poor by the staff. 
Our entry was not noticed by the crew.
Subsequently, we were not given menus and had to wait a long time to be served. 
Prices were ridiculously high, but this was somewhat expected: we had planned to enjoy our time there. 

The serving staff was not attentive at all, they did not check the guests needs regularly and they were mostly clustered at the bar. Service was in general slow, too. 
Except for when we asked for the bill...
2 glasses of champagne and 2 glasses of wine costs 600 AED. 
For this price, the experience should be impeccable. 
It was not. We were charged products we did not order. 

The waiter brought a more expensive wine, without telling us and expected us to pay the difference. The lead waiter explained that it had to be a mistake in the system, that our wine (by the glass) only was available as magnum (even though it was by the glass in the menu), and that wine we ordered (that they didn't inform us they didn't have and didn't serve us), meant being charged more. After a conversation with the waiter, we asked for the manager, to explain this bizarre situation. There was no manager available, since he was occupied in a ""meeting"", at Sunday evening. We were not treated good in our stay, except by the lovely cleaning lady Zoe, that made up for every one else there!

If you wish to have a drink at the Burj Al Arab: it will be expensive, the staff is not the best and you may leave disappointed.","2","2022-01"

Big thanks to our butler Hajar. She made our life so easy and comfy amd welcoming my family in a very professional and friendly manner. She was very helpful by arranging our bookings and with recommendations for activities.
We will definitelly come back. The hotel is fantastic.","5","2021-07"
"25th Wedding Anniversary","My wife and I traveled to Dubai with our daughter to celebrate our Silver Jubilee Wedding anniversary and stayed at the Burj Al Arab hotel. 
It was a trip of a lifetime and went beyond our wildest imagination. 
We were treated like royals and will never forget this experience. We heard so many good things about the hotel prior to our visit but the experience was better than anything we thought.
Starting with our booking arrangement,

**Nayak Gautam(Asst Mgr) made everything possible, kept in touch with us for months prior to our arrival, stayed in touch with us throughout our stay to make sure we were truly satisfied and happy. 
He welcomed us with a beautiful anniversary cake , flower bouquet and champagne and assigned us to what we regarded as the best hotel room with excellent view of the Arabian Sea. 
We highly appreciate and recommend him and his team.

He personally welcomed and introduced us into our room on arrival and assigned to us the best butler in 

**Sanjay Umrigar who is a delight to watch and the dream butler who followed in the footsteps of Nayak in making our stay a memorable one. He spent as much time as we wanted and attended to all our needs. We felt like we had known him for years. We surely appreciate him.

We highly recommend this one of a kind hotel with unimaginable description to anyone and cannot exactly describe it appropriately except to recommend experiencing it.

We appreciate the door bell people especially Sam Ikechukwu and his team, the excellent concierge group including Carmen who welcomed us on our arrival and a special thanks to our 15th floor private concierge who helped with all of our personal needs including reservations to the expo 2020 which we highly recommend. 
We also pay tribute to the concierge department for their excellent service and hotel tour which we can never forget.

We had wonderful dining experiences at the Al Iwan and other restaurants with great service and wonderful food experience. 
The hotel breakfast brunch in our opinion is a must for all visitors because words are not enough describe it and we say keep it Bur Al Arab.

This hotel and everything it offers provide a dream of a life time for anyone.

We look forward to visiting again.","5","2022-01"
"Stunning","Another exceptional day at Burj al arab. Unforgettable experience at Sahn Eddar, never short of amazing service by mister Asim.
Special mention to the most incredible valet team in the World with great Hamada in charge. You guys make every visit special, keep up with this great work. Thank you all.","5","2022-01"
"Wonderful experience","We spent two nights at the Burj Al Arab in the Panoramic suite. What an experience for our first time in Dubai. After spending a month touring multiple countries throughout Africa, ending our journey with two relaxing days at Burj Al Arab was a perfect ending to an already amazing journey. Our butler and all of the staff were stellar. The level of service provided cannot be beat! Excellent food choices, plus all of the special presents left in our room each day to help us celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary were nice bonuses. We highly recommend Burj Al Arab for your visit to Dubai. You won't want to leave!","5","2022-01"
"The hotel where anything is possible - Paradise","I could have uploaded 50 photos, Burj Al Arab is in a class of its own. I stayed in a panoramic suite and everything was perfect. 

Guest relations and the butler will do anything you require, even making me personalised stencils for my 24ct gold cappuccinos (I mean, when in Dubai hey).

There are really private areas of the hotel for guests, where you can simply relax and unwind. Of course the pool area is great .. it would be great for the hotel to start offering a wider selection of frozen alcoholic drinks (this would help with the scorching Dubai heat) although the bar staff were very accommodating making me frozen espresso martinis.

I am coming back to Dubai in May and June and will come back to the hotel.. I just hope their new tourist attraction isn’t going to make the hotel feel less intimate.

7 stars as always.","5","2022-01"
"7 stars hotel iconic","Went to have drink with friend at sky bar and changed for gilt bar. Had an amazing evening with great music, drinks, excellent service.

"Stay in the most iconic building in Dubai","Coming to Burj Al Arab is the holiday itself! It´s the Arabic hospitality and luxury at its best. 
The hotel is so beautiful and magnificent. The access to the building already makes you feel you are going to spend a good time. So unique and relaxing. Every staff provides an excellent service, they are always smiling and being attentive. The international staff can assist customers in a wide variety of languages. 
The hotel lobby is like a kaleidoscope that makes you feel in the Aladdin film.
Every detail is taken care of. 
The beds are super comfortable and the entire building is extra clean and smells so nice.
The location is perfect to hang out in the beach, dine out and enjoy the attractions in the area. It´s also few minutes away from JBR and Blue Waters. 
The food and service in the restaurants are superb. If you are not planning to stay overnight at least try the culinary experiences this great hotel has to offer.","5","2021-10"
"UNiQUE","If you can afford, obligatory you have to stay in this amazing property. From different aspects it’s outstanding experience. The inside architecture is unrealistic, like you are dreaming. Everywhere you look you will find yourself amazed. The rooms are like for kings: spacious, luxurious with perfect view. Bathroom with lot of premium amenities.
People (service)very kind and polite.
Then, why four stars: breakfast was nice, but nothing why to be remembered. Floor butler kind, but rarely present, and impossible to reach him via ‘remote control’ device. Also one night it was not possible to close ‘black’ curtain. (Manually you can’t do that). The technician (after few reminders) came, but without success. Second night it was not possible to switch of TV set…. with the same remote control device. Looks like the small issues, but seriously spoil my sleeping- and that’s main reason we are going to hotels.
Any how, will back for sure!","4","2021-12"
"Another amazing stay at the Burj al Arab","We returned to the Burj for Christmas 2021, and once again had an amazing experience. Every aspect of the customer experience is excellent at the Burj, the attention to detail is ‘off the charts’. The staff make this place what it is (the building and opulence speak for themselves), their commitment to ensuring your stay is as enjoyable as possible makes for a memorable experience.","5","2021-12"
"Family with kids Christmas stay","I will start by saying that this review is based on our experience as a family with 2 young children age 5 and 8. It will not apply to everyone. But it may help a lot of families planning to come with children. 
   We stayed here over the Christmas period for 2.5 weeks. Hotel is very opulent but I also think out dated inside and old fashioned. The duplex apartment style living was a  fun novelty at first but if I am honest I find a large suite on one level much, much easier when travelling with children. Everything that my kids wanted and needed at their age was situated at Jumeirah beach hotel, Al Naseem and Al Qasr- the kids clubs, the fun kids pools with the slides and splash play areas, turtle sanctuary and the brilliant football pitches (my son did the Football Escapes camp there)  This meant that everyday we more or less only slept at the Burj or came back to get changed to go back out again! There was no kids club open during our stay or kids pool or activities. Breakfast was very luxurious but also quiet and again they preferred the huge buffet with the better family atmosphere at Al Qasr (we stayed there in August) No joking around with the chefs here like they are used to as everyone was super quiet and serious. SAL was one of my favourite things about the Burj the pool area is so stunning and clean and fresh. My 5 year old daughter did enjoy it but my 8 year old was soon itching to get to the football pitches at Jumeirah beach  to meet his new friends from football camp/ kids club. I enjoyed the pool more when my kids were with nanny/ kids club. All the staff were very sweet and nothing was too much trouble especially Anthony who brought my kids sweets to the room every night. The Gucci shop there is entirely pointless and a waste of the space in my opinion- most people who come to Dubai are happy to shop and buy nice things but here I struggled to pick out even one item I liked. They have the most basic of selections and you are much better off going 10 min up there road to the mall which has a huge beautiful Gucci store with everything you’ll ever want. That space really could be put to better use. It reminds me of the Gucci outlet malls in Florence. I felt throughout that the hotel is not really a kids hotel. And they may as well officially announce it as so. There really is nothing here for kids, in terms of things to do or atmosphere. I found the hotel in general lacking any atmosphere at all. The what’s app concierge service was very mixed- sometimes very slow and tedious other times ok. Sometimes their response would be incorrect, sometimes no reply at all. It was very mixed. Room service menu I felt was quite limited and a pizza £60- the food wasn’t that great. I eventually on the final night had a great meal of a chicken soup and salad but otherwise nothing special at all and mostly very heavy and stodgy food and over priced.  All in all, we only paid slightly more than a large suite at al naseem or al qasr would have been and I think they would have been much better options.","3","2021-12"
"Stay at hotel","The stay at the hotel was fantastic everyone is so helpful especially Achol he’s very nice and friendly and the rest of the team like the butlers and Daniel from front desk also.the hotel is a great location and I recommend this hotel anyone that comes and because I stayed here four months.","5","2021-12"
"Burj Winter Escape","So glad to escape the UK winter to enjoy some sun and heat in Dubai. Has a wonderful experience and service at the Burj with an amazing suite. Would have happily stayed in the suite for the whole visit while our family were looked after by our so friendly butler Lillian who took care of our requirements.

Having your breakfast outdoors in the morning and the outdoor dinning at SAL in the evening was so enjoyable!

Can’t wait to come back!!!","5","2021-12"
"Pre Christmas Break","Recently stayed at the Burj Al Arab for 2 nights after 6 fantastic nights in the Mina A'Salam. 

Check in experience was great and our room as available a few hours prior to the stipulated time which was great. We were then escorted to our Deluxe Palm Suite which was fantastic. The room is truly wow with the stunning feature staircase and enough room for a family of 4 (only 2 of us). 

The butler was helpful at all times during our stay even to the point of when we asked where the pool was he didn't offer directions but got in the lift with us and took us down to the pool area. 

The pool area was nice although not as exclusive as you would expect from this hotel as external guests can visit for the day which personally I didnt agree with when paying such sums of money to stay at the hotel. 

Our negative experience came on our last night with our restaurant booking at Al Muntaha, after only being able to get a relatively late table no doubt due to non guest reservations our table was over 20 minutes late. My wife had a early morning flight so at this point we gave up, I would not expect the table to be late in a bog standard restaurant let alone perceived 7 star experience. The staff dealt with everything very poorly in my view with a clear feeling of arrogance leaving a bitter taste on our last night. 

Would I return probably not but defiantly glad we have had the change to sample what the hotel offers.","4","2021-12"
"Ultimate Level Luxury","Kaye - USA (Florida)

I must say this was by far the most amazing hotel room I've ever stayed! The ultimate level of luxury and the service was also top notch. From the moment we arrived, it was first class service.  Our room was not ready at 3pm when we arrived, however, we were accommodated nicely for our wait. The in-room breakfast was beyond excellent. The food selection at the restaurant was also delightful. The property is very large so expect to walk a bit lol. I did not have the palm view but the view of the city was still nice! The gym was excellent - with excellent amenities. I noticed the property has a water park (huge) but we were not able to get around to it.  I would say if you want to experience the highest level of luxury - from top to bottom - room decor, amenities, toiletries, shower, and everything in between - you MUST stay here!! I am looking forward to returning.","5","2021-12"
"Great to Aldrin again","We had actually decided to stay at another Jumeirah hotel but upon arrival to Dubai we quickly swapped back to the Burj Al Arab and it was a wise decision.

It was great to see Aldrin (butler) again and for him to meet on young daughter Sofia. He really is an asset to the hotel. Sofia loved meeting him every evening when coming back from the pool. He is now called Uncle Aldrin!

The breakfast seems to have improved with larger outdoor seating, plenty of staff and a really good harpist.

We enjoyed the new Sal beach area, maybe not for all but it was certainly entertaining watching the instagramers!!!!

Didn’t eat dinner in the hotel this time as not the best selection with a 11 month old.

Pool staff and porters where excellent too. 

So another amazing stay and I guess we’ll be back to see Aldrin again next year.

Many thanks to all.","5","2021-12"
"Burj Al Arab my best experience ever","Ultimate leisure experience wouldn't like to miss out. I strongly recommend Burj Al Arab to everyone. Hospitality, food and comfort at its best in Burj. Hotel has everything you may have thought or beyond to make you feel royal. 
Wild wadi water park makes your experience most memorable.","5","2021-12"

"My third and final visit!","Having visited the Burj Al Arab on two previous occasions when visiting Dubai , such an amazing experience, I wanted to take two friends to share the experience with me. I was able to book for the three of us for 9pm on the 2nd December. We arrived early and were able to enjoy and admire the swimming pool area and the internal features. I particularly enjoy standing outside and viewing the changing colours of the sail. Truly amazing! We arrived for cocktails in the Skybar at 9pm. We are served by a waiter wearing his mask under his chin and not over his mouth and nose. Service was incredibly slow causing us to ask numerous times if our drinks were going to be served. The attitude of our waiter towards us was far from acceptable. For my second drink I ordered  a non-alcoholic cocktail (mocktail). I paid 80 dirhams for a glass of ice! There wer  no moe than three mouthfuls of liquid in the whole glass. There were cranberries in the glass of ice which got caught in the straw! My first drink had been lovely. I so wished I had stopped at that. 
We had asked if it would be possible to move as the window area seats became free (we were in the middle). Everyone around us including those that arrived after us were moved to the window seats.
My third and final visit! I will not return!","1","2021-12"

"What a great experience!","To be a guest at the Burj Al Arab means from the first minute: to feel good. It is like arriving at friends who have not been seen in a long time. We were in the hotel way too early, but instead of the usual possibility to store our luggage, the very friendly lady at the check in offered us to use the hotel facilities or to go to breakfast first. With every contact we always had the feeling that everything we wanted was tried to be made possible. Always at eye level, always very friendly, like a good friend who wants to do something good for you. We got to know many good hotels. This hotel is unique. And so is the service! Thanks a lot for this. Volha & Horst","5","2021-12"
"Surreal Experience","The on-line photos don't do this property justice. The place looked a bit gauche for my taste, especially coming from classic property stays like the Ritz Carlton. How wrong I was. it was so amazingly beautiful in person. The colors, textures, grandness worked at every level. The staff were attentive, approachable, charismatic, and happy - yes happy. It appeared they loved their job. 

Our favorite was the pool, the sunsets and the breakfast - where we were serenaded by a beautiful woman playing the harp, which was piped into the speakers. When we first heard the music, we assumed it was generic background ambiance. The moment we realized that it was real-time, we were impressed. Then, this musical talent placed a piece by Andrea Bochelli at our table, I literally got tears in my eyes from the sheer power of the experience.

Truly magical experience. One night felt like a lifetime of value. Please put this on your radar if you are ever considering a splurge. For those who are not ultra wealthy, prepare yourself for sticker shock when it comes to F&B. My recommendation is to just go for it!","5","2021-12"

"The Oasis of sizzling Dubai!!","With gold interiors, lavish suites and some of Dubai’s best restaurants, it’s no surprise the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah is often considered among the best places to stay in Dubai.  Step into the lobby and be mesmerised by its bespoke spiral chandelier – created by Czech designer Sans Souci, the glittering centrepiece comprises 210 crystal tubes and weighs around 450 kilograms.  

Guests can take their pick from Al Mahara, an underwater restaurant and aquarium, or spectacular views at SAL. Other luxuries include a fleet of Rolls-Royce cars on the forecourt.

For even more relaxation, the Burj Al Arab Terrace provides 10,000sqm of outdoor space for poolside lounging. The sun-soaked deck stretches up to 100m from the base of the hotel, letting guests lounge over the water.This is a destination for the well heeled and those with a taste for the finer things in life!

"7 stars service","*It was my first visit to Dubai and to Burj Al Arab but I was blown away with the great service from the staff starting at the door upto the restaurant where I dined with my wife for afternoon tea and snacks. The care they give and the attention to detail is rearly found in any other hotel. My wife was really happy since it was our honey moon vacation, though we  were not staying at this ""7 star"" hotel but the staff there made our vacation delightful. Thanks to everyone. Special thanks to Abubakar at the entrance who gave us an insight of Burj Al Arab as I was waiting for my Uber inviting me to dine for dinner and evening drinks in one of the restuarants with the best view and for sure I will because every penny spent is worth it.*","5","2021-12"

"Unique experience","My overall experience at Burj Al Arab was pleasant. It was an incredibly unique experience however, there is room for improvement. The reception is a little small and outdated. The service provided by staff at the pool area could also be improved as we waited a long time to be tended to. ","4","2021-11"
"Wonderful Experience","We were there for our honeymoon so we had a wonderful time there, the service, the people, the manager everything was amazing.

"Amazing in all aspects","By far from travelling country to country hotel to hotel this one tops the list and meets it pronoun 7 star rating for this reason of exceptional staff kind quick friendly mannered. Hotel suite was out of this world and beautiful never seen anything like it. This is the only hotel where I had no complaints at all at anything nor did the staff or hotel give a reason to not smile and be happy and enjoy this amazing place. Every staff member u would walk pass would greet u welcome sir or good morning sir. It truly is a unremarkable experience. If u haven’t stayed here highly recommend u do.","5","2021-11"
"a time well spent.","we went to the place because its a dream for most people. wish more sights including underwater restaurant was shown. after all its by ticket on demand so space tourist and get away with it. one Mr Sai from Karnataka working there  was very knowledgeable and helpful. their tea and welcome were tepid warm but talk was as sweet as the dates they gave","4","2021-11"
"Amazing Experience.","There are not many words to describe the Burj Al Arab, apart from an amazing experience, the professionalism of the staff was amazing, nothing was a problem, the quality outstanding, a truly magnificent experience all round.","5","2021-11"
"Short Break","My wife and I had a short 3 night stay at the Burj Al Arab. This is the second visit this year to the hotel and it has really upped its game from our previous stays in 2019 so impressed now and the customer service is second to no hotel I have stayed in across the world. Thank you butler Aldrin and Anna from Guest relations you made us feel valued and so welcome at your hotel it means so much. The breakfast is amazing a beautiful view with first class food and service we just love this hotel so much. ","5","2021-11"
"A special place to stay","If you have stayed here in the past, there are some minor changes which you will note.  Physical Butlers have been replaced with a Whatsapp service (which works well), many of the restaurants were closed reducing options and the pool area seemed busier and more crowded.  However, it is still a very special and exceptional hotel to stay.  The hotel facilities and decor are extremely impressive and  create a 'wow' factor.  The service standards are extremely high and professional.  We had some issues at check in and I brought my concerns to the attention of the duty manager. My concerns were addressed promptly and very professionally and the hotel ensured we were very well looked after for the duration of our stay,  I look forward to staying here again and would continue to highly recommend it.","4","2021-11"
"Perfect for romantic getaway","The Burj Al Arab remains a must visit for any global citizen and world traveler. Having been to 90+ countries for business or personal travel, I can confidently say that this hotel is in top 5% of all stays in large part because of the excellent staff that you will encounter from the moment you arrive. 

The hotel's concierge service and amenity leadership (Tejas) particularly stand out. They helped my fiancé and I make dinner reservations, book desert off roading and ensured a fantastic relaxing weekend in their facilities. ","5","2021-11"
"1970’s sad bar","Been here several times but so sad to see how the service has deteriorated over the years !

Booked the Skyview bar for pre dinner cocktails- no welcome and sat there for 15 mins before anyone came to acknowledge us !

No atmosphere at all   Feels like a dated Studio 54 now !","1","2021-11"
"LUXURY!!","The Burj Al Arab is a life changing hotel experience. Words cannot do justice to the service provided. This is an anniversary trip that exceeded all expectations. We stayed in a 2 story suite that is like no other hotel. Ksenia checked us in and started the above & beyond service experience. Alona & Carol, our floor’s personal concierge/butler team treated us like royalty. Canapés and cocktails in the evening while enjoying our beautiful suite has been a true highlight. Thank you to the Burj Al Arab for making this a dream come true vacation!","5","2021-11"
"Drinks and Dinner at Burj al Arab","From the moment you’re waved through security and over the private road bridge to the hotel (for guests and those with dinner reservations only) you feel you’re somewhere very special. 

Both doors of the taxi were opened for us. We were encouraged to take pictures outside, staff took them for us, and then graciously shown around some of the public areas of the hotel. 

Jaw dropping opulence and colour, grandeur and delight, the exterior and interior defy belief. Oh to have had the money to stay here!!

As it was, we came for cocktails, we stayed for dinner, and we blew the holiday budget. 

Worth every single penny. 

The Skyview Bar was delightful, the martinis perfect and the tasting menu out of this world. Oysters, foie gras, steak tartare, tuna sushi - flavours and textures to savour. A beautiful bouquet of roses from the hotel as a happy retirement present - how lovely was that?!? And a mouthwatering chocolate and salted caramel cake to finish the menu. 

It was a dream come true to visit and experience and memories to treasure forever were made.","5","2021-11"
"DubaiFame : Burj Al Arab","This review is about Burj Al Arab in general short visit for a day and light dinner experience. I might be bit old fashion person, when I pay for expensive service my expectation to see a real person doing it not a tablet, not a robot or any sort of a machine neither Bot, when I call demanding a thing, I don’t want to waste my time pushing all the buttons on the tablet to find out what will happen. Everything inside screening with luxury against hefty amounts of money, yet you could have done it perhaps far much better for a lot more less somewhere else. This is my personal POV since we are dealing with heavy on the pocket brand, so this is not Family or Large group friendly place. Most of the staff are show off, they are forgetting the fact that they are working there, and we are the guests & we are paying. At times I did not feel like I am @ 7* and I for sure deserve better for what I paid.","3","2021-11"
"Spa","We had a very relaxing time ar the Spa. It was truly a luxurious experience, amazing staff. We are specially grateful to Chao, who made our day. He found out that we had a special  occasion and went out his way to create a memorable experience.","5","2021-11"
"Honeymoon","I stayed at the Burj 10 years back and had issues with the Air Con, 10 years on I came back for my Honeymoon and to say I was disappointed is a understatement. No personal touch, butler is now a E-butler nothing special.

I stayed at the One & Only Palace 5 nights before checking into the Burj for 6 nights, I would recommend the One & Only Palace everytime.","1","2021-10"
"Not a 7 star hotel","The concierge were rude, our shower was broken on the first night and our check in experience was non existent

The hotel was very clean and Spa staff were excellent. The building itself was amazing and great location but that is where it ends. 

I was constantly asked if I was staying at the hotel as I noticed alot of tours taking place around the hotel, which is something new. 

My advice, save the money go on the tour if you want to see inside the burj and stay at one of the many 5 star hotels up the road you will save a fortune and enjoy a better guest experience.","2","2021-10"
"Heaven","Best of the best!
We have stayed at all of the Jumeirah hotels and this is the pinnacle.
The suite was beautiful, the food was absolutely delicious and the overall experience was fantastic and a joy to holiday here with our young family.
We checked out of the address within a day as we thought we’d try something different only to return to our beloved Jumeirah brand.
One slight criticism on comparing this experience to several of our past is that they are clearly struggling with staffing levels around various areas but I’m sure they will overcome this challenge shortly as can be forgiven being as we have just come through a pandemic.
Thank you to the team especially Eddie on concierge - a true gentleman!
We will return!
Ps. It would’ve been nice to have met the General Manager at some point during our stay - Ermanno where were you?!","5","2021-11"
"Unforgettable","We visited the bar for drinks one evening. An experience and a hotel I will never forget. The service was obviously first class the views amazing and the hotel itself breathtaking.
Something you should do at least once but remember unless you have booked your visit you will not get past security at the bridge leading to the hotel.","5","2021-10"
"Totally Amazing","We had a 3 nights family stay here at the end of Oct 2021 (2 adults, 2 children). The service is impeccable, the food was amazing, and our room was pure luxury. 

The kids had an afternoon in Wild Wadi water park. But having spent 5 days already at Aquaventure, it was clear that Wild Wadi was a little dated, and I think this was the only area that could do with some attention.

The swimming pools and the beach are just stunning, and the services received in these location is on par with the Hotel.","5","2021-10"
"Very dissappointing","Dont expect a 7 star experience.  Lots of noticeable cut backs. Great shame, visited 8 times before and consistently excellent. Lots of guest complaining across multiple departments.

This is an icon hotel but average 5 star these days, dont expect high levels of service.","2","2021-10"
"Mrs","We were hoping to stay at this hotel next year but after our experience this morning we certainly won’t be. We have stayed in various top 5 star Dubai hotels where service is impeccable and staff can’t do enough to help. However on attempting to book the hotel today whilst we are on holiday in Dubai, to come across and visit this hotel and get a drink, the hotel we unable to accommodate and didn’t seem to even care. Not usual service at all for Dubai and extremely disappointed.","1","2021-10"
"Skybar Cocktails!","A superlative experience from arrival at the Burj Al Arab, to entering the foyer and using the glass lift to the Skybar. Wonderful views of the sun setting across the Palm from our window table.  Thank you so much to the Skybar team for your attentiveness and and for making our evening so enjoyable and memorable! Definitely an unforgettable highlight of our visit to Dubai.","5","2021-10"
"The amazing Burj Al Arab","The Burj Al Arab hotel is not just a 7 Star Hotel but a 10 Star Hotel.
Our stay was sheer bliss and we couldn’t find even one thing that was not perfect.
The staff were amazing; the suites immaculate; the spa and pools were beautiful and well-attended by very professional and kind staff; the restaurants and room service were amazing. 
We enjoyed our stay immensely and would like to thank the Burj for making our trip memorable forever.

"Very Disappointing stay","It was our 6th trip to the Burj and definitely the worst . Premium service has disappeared there is not enough staff . 2 Butlers per floor has been replaced by a WhatsApp group over 2 floors. The pool area and the beach had untrained staff who continuously failed to provide even a basic service.","1","2021-10"
"Luxurious but far from perfect","A stay we were dreaming of. Finally made it earlier this month. The check in was smooth and the reception desk staff were very polite and helpful. No doubt, the suite was ultra luxurious and very spacious with a bed room upstairs and a drawing room downstairs. The view from the large windows was spectacular. The bath room was lavish with complimentary Hermes products to add to the allure.  But then we started having problems. The A/C was way too cold and the resisted our efforts to make it warmer. So we started chatting with the butler through whatsapp. A gentleman dropped by and tried to make it alright but it remained cold. So much so that at night we had to switch off the A/C. But the biggest problem was that very few restaurants were open for drinks and dinner and all were booked solid by guests. We were politely asked to go out to the nearby hotels for dinner. Very weird, indeed! The breakfast next morning, however, was excellent. 

Overall, a truly luxurious stay but something was obviously lacking and we were left wondering whether it was worth the money we paid.","4","2021-10"
"Girls' trip afternoon tea at Burj Al Arab. Definitely a must do experience. ","Summary: afternoon tea Burj Al Arab is an experience for friends with multiple courses, array of teas and beautiful location. 

SECURITY: You cannot enter the gate without a reservation. Once you are confirmed as having a reservation at the gate, you can drive in (impressive views). 
WELCOME: Concierge are incredibly friendly, efficient and have a ""you relax, we take care of of attitude"".  Inside, if you can take your eyes away from from decor (escalators with aquariums), the staff are also welcoming, friendly. The ladies manning the tea station (shout out to Anastacia for friendliness, knowledge and hospitality). 
AFTERNOON TEA: it is a four course menu. When we went, it started with crab meat and caviar (with a gold leaf), followed by finger sandwiches (delicious).  A cleansing yuzu sorbet followed then the scones and a selection of pastries. Everything except the pastries were delicious. The pastries seemed to suffer from unnecessary complication rather than taste and balance which made them rather anti climatic to the simple yet absolutely delicious other courses. 
TEAS: I drank the Arabian nights, elderflower and lemon and chocolate tea.  My favourite being the elderflower, the balance was fantastic. Recommend to add fresh lemon to it. 
AMBIENCE: live music serenade by pianist with sultry voice. Flower arrangement simply stunning. Very wonderful experience. ","4","2021-10"
"Incredible stay!","This hotel firmly lives up to the hype as the World’s Best Hotel and 7-star rating. The end-to-end experience was magical from the rooms, full sized Hermes Paris product, harp player in louboutin’s over breakfast, infinity pool overlooking the Arabian Sea and the best staff to guest ratio for impeccable hospitality 10/10! ","5","2021-10"
"Severely lacking","Would have given this one star but to be fair after voicing our concerns and disappointment the guest relations team/butlers did step up considerably
This is our sixth stay in Burj al Arab ( and 20th in this resort property) so we are aware of how service has declined so much especially if you are not from a certain east European country
Obviously post Covid some factors must be taken into account, but the level of service is so dramatically reduced you wonder exactly what you came here for?
No longer the welcome of a butler as you exit your floor, evening aperitifs had to be asked for, toiletries in bathrooms very reduced etc
The adult pool was like a crèche, despite the family pool opening two days ago

Fifty percent of restaurants were closed. This was a major point and we definitely would have postponed our visit because of this
All very well to complain but what can they do? Step up their staffing level as a beginning step. Make all guests feel welcome as they used to do
I read in the press that the restaurants are receiving make overs or new restaurants being added. No mention of this from any staff member.  All of whom gave vague answers. This so easily could added to interest and rebooking rather than the thought we would never return 
Overall a very disappointing stay","2","2021-10"
"Amazing place amazing Team","Amazing place and amazing experience every time… the pool is refreshing and never too crowded . The food is amazing especially their wagyu burger truffle pizza and fried calamari. What makes the experience special is the staff. I can’t describe enough how professional and friendly Pablo and Nitish are. They never fail to make my visit exceptional. Nitish attends to details and is always there to assist and provide the best customer experience. They surprised me with a small cake and flower for my special occasion and that made my day 😃  T.J is also super helpful and friendly. He is very proactive at offering assistance and is always around . . I like the popsicle guy who comes at 4:00 pm. Always smiling despite the heat .  All in all, a great place to go.","5","2021-10"

The team at the beach were awesome 

Great safety instruction and equipment.

I would highly recommend this company if you are wanting to hire a jetski in the jumeriah resort area.

On my next return to this resort I’ll be sure to use them","5","2021-10"
"Amazing!","Amazing hotel and as a family we stayed 7nights and hope to come back again. We arrived early and we were given complimentary food/drinks whilst we waited for our suite.  Only issue is they have very limited dining options at hotel if you have young kids ","5","2021-10"
"Did not achieve expectations","Rooms were clean, location was good and in general I liked the layout and size of the rooms. However, I did not like the service at all. Not sure if it was because of covid or not, but I had to call two or three times for housekeeping or the butler to provide an amenity I asked. They give you a whatsapp e-butler so you can message them your requests. I asked for few items and in one instance they replied with we will look into it and get back to you and never got back to me. In another instance, they didn't even respond to my request. Overall, expected more from this property","2","2021-09"
"They over asking IDs for guests","Slow in service and very complicated services. They don’t provide what you like on time. They don’t respect guests. Lot of broken furniture. They workers are not happy and not welcoming guests. 
Pool side as well although lot of workers but services is very bad.

"No basis for 7 stars","Overall the stay was very unsatisfying for a 7 star hotel. It ist he 4th and last time we stayed in Burj al Arab.
4 times we tried to book form the mentioned reservation E-Mail but 4 times we didn´t get any reply. 
As we came there we asked for a manager to tell them about our issues. 
Miss Irina was very friendly and told us that the suite is not yet available and informed us that we will get an upgrade fort he two-bedroom suite. 
So far so good. About 3:15h she showed us the suite but the door tot he second bedroom was locked. As a guest i asked myself why they tell us about an upgrade when we are having the same situation than before (only one bedroom). 
Next thing is that we were shocked about the view which showed the construction oft he new Jumeirah hotel.
Anyway we were looking forward to see the new SAL area. When we came there we were more than shocked. It was full of people and the lady can´t even find beds for us. It is so poor that the Burj al Arab is in need of visitors for the weekend. Unworthy of discussion! I think this location supposed to be cool but it was just inappropriate!!! The manager Mr. Vijay came and asked what happened. He kindly supported us and brought us to the Al Nassem Summersalt beach club by buggy. This place was nice and quiet with a good service. 
Can it be true that a 7 star hotel don´t even have a private beach?
Our butler Miss Carol was striving to do everything that we feel comfortable. So we told her that we booked halfboard and would like to eat in any restaurant. She informed us that only 2 (!!!) restaurants are open and after a few calls she had to tell us that both restaurants are booked out. 
It was like a joke. Staying in a luxury hotel with halfboard booked but don´t have the chance to have dinner. No words left. As Miss Carol is very client-friendly and professional she suggested us in-room dining. There were only 4 (!) meals to choose. Imagine you stay in Burj al Arab and every 4th day you have to eat the same. That is ridiculous. Nevertheless the in-room dining was amazing and the quality of food was great. 
During the evening we get to know that there will be only 1(!!!) restaurant (Al Iwan) for breakfast. That means you can´t even have your breakfast outside. Unfathomable! 
Anyway the breakfast was great. The waiter George and Hazem were very kind and attentive. 
I was asking for guava but one of the ladies in Al iwan told me that they don´t have it. Really asking myself where the 7 stars came from… You should never say „no“ to a guest. That was the service we used to know from our stays before. 
Another point is that there was no parfume on the suite like always. This has nothing to do with Corona because it was always new and wrapped. So this should be no excuse. In addition there was not even bath salts or bath bombs. The towels seemed to be low price products as it is standard for 3 star hotels. Sheer and old. Furthermore some coverings oft he screws in the shower were missing which is also not acceptable.
As we went tot he Sal Beach Club the manager reserved a nice place for us but later we went to the Al Nassem again because it was too crowdy and also very noisy because oft he scooters. This has nothing to do with relaxation and privacy.
Miss Carol kindly made a reservation for the Al Muntaha restaurant. It is a nice place but one waitress told us what we will get for dinner. How can it be that a guest can´t decide what to eat for dinner?? This is presumptuous.  
On the check-out day the luggage boy was very kind but when it comes tot he bill we were again surprised that the in-room dining was calculated although we didn´t had any other choice. 

In conclusion the Burj al Arab is a nice 4 star hotel but that´s all. The 7 stars we used to know were seemingly insupportable over the years. Only the butler Miss Carol, the pool manager Mr. Vijay and Mr. George and Hazem from the Al Iwan restaurant made the most of the situation for us and were brilliant in performing damage control. Thanks to them.

"Afternoon Tea at the Burj al Arab","Disappointment was an understatement (it's no wonder they ask for full payment upfront!)  The tables are no longer in the sky bar but now situated in the hotel lobby so you feel like you've been penned into a corner with boring view of their sister hotels opposite.  To start with they have done away with the menu letting you know what they are about to serve you.  The standard of food has also dropped with very mediocre sandwiches and cheap looking desserts.  We had one glass of date sparkling juice and one cup of tea.....hardly worth the £200 price tag.  When we left no one asked whether we had enjoyed our experience perhaps they already knew something we should have known from the start.  My advice to anyone thinking about going is to save your money for something where they have given it a bit more thought other than profit","2","2021-09"
"Total luxury","From start to finish you feel special when you stay at the Burj, everything is total luxury, the rooms are amazing and the staff treat you like royalty, highly recommended, if you can afford it!  The pool area is amazing as well.","5","2021-09"
"Exemplary servive all over the hotel","When we arrived on september 29th, our suite was not ready at 3 p.m..
We were not amused and reached out to reception. 
At once Ms. Maria took care of us in a professionnal and exemplary manner. She told us that there was a problem with our suite an offered us a double upgrade. Until this suite was ready we were petted proper and good.
Thank you Maria, your crises management is perfect. Good job.","5","2021-10"
"Very good but not seven*","We had a pleasant and swift checkinn by maricana and her assistant Malo

We were taken to our room.nice big suites double layered .The hotel is huge and a unique piece of architectery with glowing deco but the hotel is more conventional and business oriented type of hotel.. Not a resort type of feeling.

nevertheless the service was very high

Overall a pleasant stay but not a seven star service. The hype of Burj vs The service and quality that you get overall dont match the price you pay..period","4","2021-09"
"Worst stay...","Hi people I am telling you this place is not at all worth the hype now a days and we have multiple reasons for that....  Late check in provided not only to us but many guests...  Bell boy service and room services are extremely slow never had anything on first call....i don't recommend this place at all for vegans or vegetarians they always miss your allergic / dietary preferences...  They even served us food with egg almost in every meal even after multiple times of intimation that we don't eat egg...there was construction going on one side of hotel making the views worst and not at all worth the price... One more note to the management that we travelled almost 2500kms on my special day to be at burj Al Arab and I received such kind of experience which is not at all worth it.","1","2021-09"
"Disappointing considering its status","First time staying in Burj Al Arab and most probably last time as it has been such a disappointment.
When you think about Burj Al Arab, top of the class comes to your mind. But it is not the case, at least when we stayed there. Hotel and room themselves are luxury for sure. But when you want to be best in class, you need service and I can find at least 3-4 resorts in Dubai offering better service. Staff is under trained: 
-waited 5pm to check-in, they offer drinks and cakes for you to wait but want to charge you for a glass of champagne, some luxury hotels offer glasses of champagne upon arrival, reception could not provide an ETA, therefore had to wait.
-the iron provided had dirty water
-normally on each floor you should have a reception, did not see anyone for 2 days on our floor, the resort is completey understaffed
-while checking out, the woman has no manners and did not have ask how was our stay, did not request our car while we were checking out, another receptionist was sneezing and not wearing properly her mask and did not sanitize her hand before touching other people’s passports, a health hazard in COVID-19 time
-while waiting for our car, no one offered us to stay inside and told us car is coming. We waiting outside for 10 minutes while it was 40+ degrees.

To summarize, hotel itself is great, especially the outdoor pool. But the service is very poor for such a resort, other Jumeirah hotels such as Zabeel Saray provides a way better service, and other hotels not in Jumeirah group offers better service.
The management has completely overlooked quality of service and training of staff which is the most important for a luxury resort.
At the end, it is a tourist trap and would not recommend it to anyone who are used to high end hotels.","2","2021-09"
"Burj Al Arab","Amazing hotel, very friendly staff, best amenities, superb breakfast, really enjoyed the indoor pool. The suite was massive, and very clean I will definetly return to this hotel. The beach club is also great","5","2021-09"

"Definitely not 7 star service","Stayed here with my husband and 3 year old child. The hotel and facilities are great but the service is very poor. Firstly we asked to make dinner reservations. Spoke to concierge to made a reservation for us.. We made our way to the restaurant to find out they don't cater for kids under 7. Then had to wait 30 mins for another buggy with a very hungry child to find somewhere else to eat and had no help from staff.
The room was very nice but again the curtains were broken and jacuzzi was broken too. I emailed the hotel to let them know this and didn't receive any response

Even the lady that stands at the front of the hotel had a very poor attitude. We asked if she could take a photo of us and she told us how photos don't look nice in  certain places and walked off which was very odd behaviour

Definitely not the 7 star service. I would actually say it's far from that and save yourself the money. The hotel is really nice but if only the service was there to match","2","2021-09"
"Burj Al Arab","Hotel is phenomenal but the initial service that we received was not up to par with a hotel that is considered by some as a 7 star hotel. Our room wasn't available at check in but they did somewhat make up for it by allowing us a somewhat late checkout. Staff was friendly but wasn't very helpful with directions and being forthcoming with things to do during our stay. Felt like we had to figure things out ourself or ask multiple people to get good directions. The Gold room and the main restaurant was closed.","4","2021-09"
"Unforgettable one of a kind experience","An unforgettable stay, second to none experience.
From the meet and greet to the farewell an absolutely imminent and exceptional experience. 
Second time visiting the Burj Al Arab, even though the service and hotel exceeded the expectations. Complementary Rolls Royce transfer from Jumeirah beach hotel, complementary upgrade to a panoramic suite and service out of this world made the stay an unforgettable experience and perfect birthday present for our sons 1st birthday. An experience that we will cherish forever. 
We look forward to hopefully returning next year and make it a tradition to stay at Burj Al Arab for many years to come.","5","2021-09"
"Amazing hotel","Stayed for 2 nights and had an amazing experience.  The staff, the rooms and the pool area were all are fantastic.  Ate a couple of times at SAL which was fantastic.  We were a bit disappointed that all restaurants weren’t open for more choice but understandable due to restrictions.  Gum was great - what a view.  Would highly recommend ","5","2021-09"

"AMAZING!","We stayed for 3 nights for honeymoon, rooms were really clean, service was amazingly fast and everything was high quality! Staff is very respectful and helpful. E-Butler service is a really good help 10/10 would stay again.","5","2021-09"
"Beginning to Age","We have visited the Burj many times and we're fortunate enough to visit in the early years when it was probably the best hotel. As the years have gone by its now showing its age and the service is not what it used to be. You can notice the aging in the suites and even in the foyer with the carpets and also the water fountains. The hotel is in need of some TLC but despite that it's still quite an icon. 
We spent 5 days and found it still has that magic but maybe due to covid the service was slower. On the floors where the butlers manned the floors all the times, now the butlers man two floors and at times it was hard to find them. The hotel used to have Hermes aftershaves which were complimentary which is no longer the case.  Breakfast at the moment is no longer being served at Bab Al Yam but instead at Al Iwan which is not the same. They have a gut wheeling a trolley with fruits and yogurt which is odd for a hotel of this stature. Breakfast isn't a buffet but Al la carte which is a shame. This apparently is a short term thing as they renovate Bab Al Yam. Our suite overlooked a building site where they are building a new hotel. Would have preferred a suite the other side given we wanted to celebrate a few occasions. 
The hotel is wonderful if you want to celebrate an occasion as the guest relations will do whatever you ask them discretely. They arranged an 18 party for my son 2 years ago and did his 20th this year. 

All in all a great hotel but does need updating as it is falling behind. The tech used to be leafing edge but now its far behind the likes of other hotels in a similar bracket. ","4","2021-09"
"Amazing views!","Who doesn’t know this famous tower and the lavish hotel it hosts? I’m sure that everybody has seen that skyscraper at least once on TV, on a depliant or on a travel magazine. When you enter this hotel, you feel like you’ve arrived to another world. The landscapes you can admire from the top are simply breathtaking!","5","2021-09"
"7 Star weekend","Fab stay at the iconic burj.  Rooms spacious and amazing service. Decor not to everyone’s taste as a bit garish but good quality. Bed was really comfortable and pillows heavenly.  Pool area is lovely although was very busy when we went.    ","5","2021-09"
"Experience of a Lifetime","From the moment the bellman opened the door to my taxi upon arrival, I was attended to practically every moment of my four-day stay and continued till the bellman closed the door of my taxi for return to the airport.  There is not enough space in this review for me to describe all of the features & events of my experience. I will say the booking details, descriptions and photographs were exactly as expected.   This has never been the case in all of my travels.  I would definitely stay at Burj al Arab again, if the opportunity presents itself.","5","2021-09"
"Memories for a lifetime","Simply amazing. Our stay was beyond belief. The suite was outstanding and so was the pool. However, it is a bit of an attraction. Lots of people stay there just so they can say “I slept at Burj Al Arab” but it doesn’t diminish the hotels quality services","5","2021-09"
"Truly spectacular experience","We were overwhelmed with such beauty and opulence. A day alone at the pool under a umbrella will help you forget all your woes. A treasure on the ocean. Looking forward to returning with our children. ","5","2021-09"
"Out of this world","This hotel rewrites the rule book on quality. The title of the worlds most luxurious hotel is fully lived up to. 

From the impeccable cleanliness to the magnificent staff who could not do more for you, this hotel experience is like nothing I have ever experienced before. 

I cannot rate this hotel highly enough","5","2021-09"
"Amazing stay","It was amazing stay  at Burj Al Arab celebrating me and wife our anniversary, it was one of the best stay at Jumeirah hotels group.
It was the third stay for us at Burj Al Arab and we will rebook again soon.","5","2021-08"
"7 stars?? Not really","7 stars? Webpage delivers different available time slots for the various restaurants every time one opens the page and whenever one tries to book one of the available time slots, all that appears is a permanent hourglass. 
Emails sent to their advertised “restaurant booking” email address are not even ignored. Very disappointing","1","2021-09"
"20 year anniversary","From the security in front of the bridge to the valet parking, to the check in to the opening of the door to our suite 7 stars for sure.
There is nothing that comes close to the burj al arab.
The anniversary card from the manager to the dinner at sals to the breakfast Chelloist.
The wedding anniversary cake on the table in our suite .The roses all over the bed and counters 

The service is 7 star.the suite is 7 star. The staff is 7 star and the price is actually not so bad at all given what we've paid at other places over the years in the UAE.
The reading room with the snooker table and talise spa is of the best in the world.
It is nearly impossible to find fault with this 30 year old iconic establishment .
The management is on top of their game that is evident from you turn into the road at wild wadi.

There is only one 20 year wedding anniversary in ones life  and there is only one burj al arab.......","5","2021-09"
"Amazing stay ","Stayed thire for 1 night and wish I have booked more days the hotel was wanderfull the room view was amazing stuff where super nice over all 10 over 10 will not regret the expiriance the best room service food I have ever had in any hotel the only isuee is the most of there restaurant is closed till farther notice ","5","2021-09"
"Beautiful rooms but the hotel is urgently in need of an upgrade","The hotel is beautiful and certainly has the wow factor. However, for the cost per night, the hotel is certainly in need of an upgrade and it felt as if the hotel hasn't really moved with the times and caught up with the competition of other 5 star hotels in Dubai.

The gym facilities is amongst one of the most basic of the five star hotels I have stayed at in Dubai. 

The breakfast options are also incredibly limited compared to many five stars in Dubai.

 Unfortunately the curtains in our suite wouldn't close which was a slight problem as our baby prefers to sleep in total darkness. We resorted to putting the baby cot in one of the bathrooms which was a shame given the size of the suits.

 Apart from this, the service was very good and the staff do try and go the extra mile. Given the press around this hotel, guests book a stay with very high expectations. In my view it may be wise to lower the expectations so as to not leave  disappointed. I don't believe this is the best five (or seven star) in Dubai. Nevertheless we did enjoy our stay.","3","2021-09"
"Burj Al Arab","This place is out of this world. Me and family loved being there, everything was Royal and amazing. I would highly recommend to be there at least once if you are visiting Dubai. Beautiful Room, amazing services and best technology.","5","2021-09"
"One of the best hotel","Excellent Service/Breakfast/Food thought out our stay. Worth every penny. Amazing Experience. Done a lot hoteling in our life but never had experience like Burj Al Arab Hotel. Provide all necessities. Very Clean, lovely and romantic place to enjoy your trip.","5","2021-08"
"Everything was Perfect","The overall service was amazing. A perfect place for relaxing. Talise spa was execllent . Loved the pool as well as the restaurants. view is definitely breathtaking. Special amenities for birthday celebration was arranged and the team ensured everything was taken care off.","5","2021-08"
"Amazing experience  - SAL at Burj Al Arab","Spent 4 nights at the Burj Al Arab last week.  First time back since they extended the pool area and created the new SAL terrace.  Was blown away by the sheer size of it and its design/views.  The breathtaking setting was only matched by the quality of service we received.  Pavlos (The manager) and his team did a magnificent job in looking after us in the 4 days we were there.  Hats off to them.  If you are looking for the best pool / terrace in Dubai then SAL is a must visit in my book.  See you guys very soon.","5","2021-08"
"The ultimate Dubai hotel","I had always wanted to stay at the Burj and I finally did in August 2021. The overall building architecture and the massive duplex suites are astonishing. But the food and service are also exceptional. We are going back again next week and can’t wait!","5","2021-08"
"SAL and the pool","I went to SAL yesterday for a day with my family. We ate for lunch a salted seabass. They cleaned it in front of us. I recommend going there if you like seafood. The place is also beautiful and the staff is nice.","5","2021-08"
"Top quality service","The guys at the pool terrace made my friends and I have a memorable experience and we will definitely be returning for more visits. Ali and Sumodi most especially made me feel the most welcome I’ve felt in any hotel. They were very helpful and you could see they are genuinely nice guys. Highly recommend!","5","2021-08"
"Dubai family vacation","This has to be the best hotel in the world. We had the best check in from Vincenzo, Ita, Maria. The best and friendly  pool service from Pavlovs, jimby. The best butler service from jaafar, Hajar, William. I love the burj al Arab it’s worth every dollar. ","5","2021-08"
"Our dream come true","It was our honeymoon I booked to surprise my wife . Burj made it a unforgettable experience and we had the time off our life’s . Thank you so much burj and especially josh from the front desk who was so kind and gave us a tour around the hotel.","5","2021-08"
"The Best","We could just only spend one night at the Hotel for a stop-over in Dubai. We booked directly via jumeirah and got a Deluxe Palm Suite offered for a very fair rate. We also booked a transfer from the airport. At arrival at the airport we were directed to the Jumeirah Airport Lounge, which was great. All organized perfectly to the highest level!! After checking in our suite was just amazing! We as a family were treated as royals and had a great experience. The lunch at SAL near the beautifull pool area was great and delicious (try the Seabass in saltcrust!!!!). It was a pitty we had to return to the airport early in the morning next day. Next time we definately spend more days. ","5","2021-08"
"Unforgettable Experience!","We had the best time ever on our visit. Despite this being our 3rd visit to Dubai, it really felt like the first. The staff is amazing, everyone was super friendly. Hats off to our butler Omar! He really paid utmost attention to our needs and took a keen interest in making sure that our stay was amazing. And we absolutely appreciated that. 
We emailed hotel in advance requesting for early check in and microwave in the room as we were travelling with a baby, and we were so pleased that they considered our requests. 
The interior of the hotel is absolutely beautiful and royal and they treat their guests like royalty. 

Service was the highest in all restaurants. We loved the pool restaurant Sal. Food was amazing. The pavlova was to die for and the staff were amazing. They accommodated our little one, and entertained him. 

The only complain is we got so used to first class service that we now expect it from everywhere we go, which has left us terribly disappointed. Lol","5","2021-08"
"Top Notch Rooms","The property and rooms are top notch at the Burj Al Arab, one of the finest hard products that we've had the pleasure of experiencing. For most of the stay, the service was very good at the front desk and at the restaurants.

We e-mailed the hotel before arrival to arrange for a car to bring us to the hotel, as well as to solicit upgrade costs and did not receive a response. Ended up calling the hotel the day before to arrange for a car. There were some issues at checkout because our online travel agent/booking service did not pay the hotel. Apparently this is something that happens quite frequently. We had to pay for the room cost on our personal credit card until the OTA paid the hotel the next day.","4","2021-03"
"A fantastic hotel that can be highly recommended","The duplex room is so relaxing and so big, breakfast was excellent, the staff was very friendly and supportive, the beach and pool was clean and quiet, the architecual building is impressive, royelish interior, the restaurants were simply outstanding, We enjoyed our stay, kids had a great time...It’s truly a world class experience..","5","2021-08"

He was a very nice and friendly guy i met and together we built up a friendship.
Dear Burj Arab Administration, you can be very proud to have employees like Samuel. Again thanks to all how made our stay like it was.

See you again Burj Al Arab ;)","5","2021-08"

"Excellent Choice","Burj Al Arab is an excellent choice for a stay in Dubai, whether short or long. Staff are pleasant, rooms are comfy and the food, especially in room dinning and 24hr service is worth raving about. And if you require a chauffeur to drive you around the city and show you all sites and scenery,best restaurants and hangouts, Ibrahim Akhlail is your go to man. He's the best!","5","2021-07"

"Worst customer service","We have stayed in this hotel several times. Always a great pleasure. We had plans to come back in August. 3 months ago I tried to reach them by email, no answer, I called, they said to contact me again, still waiting for answer. I sent emails because I wanted to plan a surprise stay for my husband’a birthday. Still no answer, no reaction. I was so upset I complained to my husband. So the surprise isnt a surprise anymore. We tried to reach out for
the general manager bij his linkedin. No answer. Worst possible customer relation service in the world!!!! So angry, so upset. I checked and confirmed their email adress by phone. Got a call-center. I do not want a call-center. I want someone from the hotel as a contact. Such a shame!","1","2021-06"

"Dated","Sadly the Burj al Arab is now a bit dated and we didnt have the 7 star luxurious experience we were after...pre-check in was incredibly confusing with someone calling and emailing me to tell me my credit card was invalid and our reservation was not in fact guaranteed - the day before the trip. The room had a very overpowering smell as well and whilst I can't comment on the decor as this is the BAA, some of the amenities werent fully functioning (the shower was impossible to turn on). Whilst we were offered a complimentary drink at the Skyview Bar, the list of drinks was FOUR martinis! What if you don't like martinis....the best part of the hotel was the pool area, where we spent 90 minutes before checking out...","3","2021-07"
"Jetski","Very enjoyable…. The family real enjoyed.
We shall visit again. It’s worth it. A must try when you visit, especially the sunset timing. The trainer are the best and ready to help whenever you need something","5","2021-07"
"POOR SERVICE","We reached the hotel at 1pm for check in, We were told room would be ready by 230pm by the check in staff ( Chinese staff ) . Till 330pm room was not ready.. We had to beg for our own room.
Finally 345 pm we were given our room. 
We requested for late check out but were told to leave by 12pm.

"Exceptional hotel, service and stay","Great hotel - the service and experience were truly exceptional! Nothing is too much of a problem for the staff.

The pool area is fantastic and you do defiantly feel that you’re staying in a 7* star hotel.

I would highly recommend the Burj Al Arab - having stayed in various hotels around the world, this hotel is memorable and truly exceptional. 

I will be back again very soon!","5","2021-04"

"The biggest Dubai disappointment","It was my first visit of Burj for 4 years living in Dubai. First impression: stinky. Smell not like luxury hotel but like rotten clothes. 
My husband and I had an anniversary, celebrating by staying in Jumeirah hotel, visiting different restaurants in this place  and decided to end up in “iconic” hotel. We booked a table in sky view bar. 

At the entrance of sky view-bar hostes (black lady) ( she knows it’s our anniversary)  said that shorts are not allowed. My husband was wearing classic  Bermuda shorts. We both look so elegant and classy. Especially we just came from anniversary dinner from Kayto.

We live in Dubai in 50 degrees hit.  what you guys expected us to wear? We didn’t come wearing beach shorts or  something like this. We are going to different restaurants twice per week and know how we should look like. 

That hostess said she should check with manager, left, went until end of corridor, turned around and said we can come in! What was that ? If she wanted to embarrass my husband and ruined our evening she succeeded. 

Hostess should have common sense and sense of taste but not being just robot.

We didn’t want to stay in this place of course. Such a horrible impression, worst welcome ever. We didn’t expect it from one of the most famous hotel. 

I’m looking forward to hear from you how you are going to solve this problem. 

Kind regards,

"it is not worth what you pay","We had long dreamed of coming to this iconic and well-known hotel, as well as exclusive and fascinating.

It happens that we had a duplex suite, dated, it is not our style of course.  The service is not great.  But I do wish to name the waiter Karan who went out of her way to make our breakfast better.  The beach club is very lively, but I don't understand that hotel guests are not allowed to go swimming before 9:00 when they open.","3","2021-07"
"Burj Al Arab Experience","We had choose. Burj Al Arab for a mini staycation to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary and we can definitely say that we had the most amazing experience of a life time. Right from the arrival till departure, it was fantastic the hotel staff, room service, e-butler service all was great. ","5","2021-07"
"Nice to be back at Burj","Stayed here over the weekend after a long time was nice to be back . The overall service experience was very good in all departments! Went to Sal the nice outdoor infinity pool a bit hot the season for outdoors! Overall was a wonderful experience! Thank you . ","5","2021-07"
"Memorable Experience!","We stayed in September 2019 for 3 nights as a birthday celebration.
The experience starts from the drive up to the front doors; we were greeted by a lovely lady who made us feel welcome and we had welcome drinks.
The interior is breathtaking, very grand and colourful with fish swimming as you go up the escalator. The water fountain is also impressive.
To check in, we were taken into our room which was huge! We had an office area, kitchenette area, a large lounge with a floor to ceiling window looking over the sea. Everything is gold! An impressive curved staircase took us to the closet area, bedroom and large bathroom which had a jacuzzi bath. 
Again the bedroom had a floor to ceiling window, with electric curtains. 
We had slippers and flip flops provided and toiletries in the bathroom. 
The hotel itself has plenty of restaurants and a gold bar, where you can have cocktails and snacks. 
We didn’t stay round the pool (too hot) but we did get a golf cart that took us on a short drive down to Little Venice where you can go on a gondola, and visit lots of shops and restaurants. 
A memorable experience.","5","2021-06"

"Disappointed","I had stayed at this property 10 years ago and have returned to Dubai several times and stayed at different places but this time I decided to return to The Burj  and it was disappointing. The level of service came down  several levels.  It seems that they are hiring people with no experience at all and no common sense. The hotel needs updating, the phones are old, no concierge at each floor,  arriving is messy with too many people running around. Breakfast was  disorganized, the servers had no experience in servicing, cutting you off to ask questions, removing dishes before you finish eating, too many people around your table , no coordination whatsoever. The pool felt  like a club, a place to see and be seen, not a family place and at the end of the day, people wondering around, trying to find the lobby at my floor 12th floor) , I had to show him the exit, where is the security?  For the daily rate they charge, it was disappointing and the people working needs polishing.
They hired People with no personality and hard to deal with. Pleasantries go a long way.","3","2021-06"
"No privacy, many insects many bullies","Unfortunately and sadly this experience happened in what the world consider it 7 stars hotel , as a regular customer to burj alarab and turned to be gold customer with Jumeira in few days and saw many mistakes and faced some issues, but I ignored it as there is nothing perfect 100% . Today 27 Jun my check out , I found insects on my bed scratching my hand but I didn’t give it any attention what was a really terrible I assigned the ( don’t disturb) sign and taking shower, someone was knocking the door in roundness crazy way it was 13:45 I am preparing to check out even they say silver member can check at 14:00 . However the knocking stop for a minute and returned again, suddenly a lady shouting loudly calling my name and only the portable door lock stopped her to enter the suite. I went out from the shower ( naked ) and hide behind the wall and said to her yes she insisted to talk to me she wanted me to presented in front her , but I was naked and told her I am checking out in 5 minutes. I thought the hotel maybe called me on my phone but they didn’t and the suit phone didn’t ring !!!! So why sending a bully stuff to break my privacy and freaking me why didn’t call me as a gentle process. Unfortunately for many times I had to stay with this hotel again and again because they are the only one who has suite with two floors.","1","2021-05"
"A very unique  beautiful place must to visit 💙","‎‏I always love to visit my favorite place in Dubai which is Burj Al Arab; the epitome of luxury. Incomparable hospitality sumptuous dining and impeccable service make this hotel among the most unique in the world!. In my last visit I have to the Sah Eddar lounge. I had some delicious desserts and new creative drinks. I would like to give a big thanks to Kristina and Asim, who have made my last visit unforgettable. They were very helpfu, kind, and professional and the service was amazing.","5","2021-06"
"The best Hotel in Dubai.","I travel to Dubai quite frequently and Burj Al Arab is the hotel I always choose to stay in. The service is excellent, the place is beautiful and the atmosphere is awesome. 

My most favourite part of the hotel is the Talise Spa. There is a very nice employee working there, his name is Chao and he would always be there to help and assist me with anything I need and this made the stay in the hotel even better.","5","2021-05"
"Best day in Dubai","Best guy in the  pool ( Robert ) very friendly and helpful guy,  for everyone is going to the pool you need to meet him!! . Try to come in the 12 int he afternoon so you can enjoy all the time till 6 clock","5","2021-06"
"The Most wonderful and best Hotel we have ever","Forever grateful for making our stay extra special. All the staffs are beautiful and handsome, courteous, very accommodating what you paid is worth every penny. We had the most wonderful experienced, very generous when it comes to complimentary foods","5","2021-06"
"Unique hotel, communication should improve","We appreciated the uniqueness of the hotel, the suites and the exterior areas. They are of a different level. In real it was better than in the pictures. 

Communication let us down during our stay. Inconsistent and inaccurate information has let to some disappointments with our kids. 

Covid affects normal operation, which is understandable. But guests should be properly informed about it. 

But still we would not have missed out on the experience and we trust the staff will improve on the communication. ","3","2021-06"
"A bit disappointed","It’s a nice hotel but not worth of what you what you pay for. I think this is only better for couple but not for families. There is a communication problem. From checking In, nobody informed us that most of the restaurants and kids club are closed. We even have to arranged it ourselves where to eat dinner since our booking is halfboard. No one told us (since kids club is closed) that is possible to go to other hotel’s kids club like Jumeirah beach hotel and Al Qasr. We have to find it out ourselves. It is ashame for such an hotel icon of Dubai will gave u a very bad communications. Every staff gave us different information which leads us to a wrong planning. It could be better if they put someone who knows better about the hotel.","4","2021-05"
"The Epitome of Luxury","Having been to a few hotels in Dubai either on holiday or just passing through. We were somewhat already accustomed to good services and attention to detail.  My wife and I stayed here after many months of having flights canceled due to the pandemic, understandably. 
So we were filled with excitement and tense anticipation to see if this hotel did actually live up to its self-proclaimed 7 stars.

It can always be very difficult after getting off a 1st class flight with emirates, to enter a hotel. As you have been pampered from the departure lounge, through the flight and receive 1st class treatment all the way through Dubai international airport. So the hotel already has a lot to live up to. 

However, The Burj and its' staff do not play games. Professionalism is at its peak. As soon as we got into the grand entrance hall, you are hit with the splendor and the majesty of the place. We were immediately greeted by a lovely receptionist, who had already organized early check-in as we had arrived @ 7 am. We were led up to the room and received a great induction on how to use the controls, the time of dinner etc. We stayed in a Panoramic room for the duration of our stay, this is truly a spectacular room, the room from its lowest to highest point must be taller than a double-decker bus, or at least it felt like it. We truly felt as though we were in our own penthouse apartment, and we were only on the 26th floor.

We were introduced to the e-Butler system which in my opinion is revolutionary. Being able to contact the Butler by WhatsApp is something all modern hotels need to adopt. This is by no means unique to the Burj, but it shows that the Burj is keeping up with modern times and the changing needs of their clientele. As millennials, we often require information a lot faster than older generations and unfortunately means we have less patience.

Covid 

The Burj means business when it comes to covid, at all times we felt very secure. From the hygiene packs in our room to the hand sanitization stations dotted around the hotel. This hotel has a lot of offer and at the time we visited covid had not restricted the hotels functioning, the hotel has seemingly adapted and adapted well.

Royal Cabana 

My wife and I hired a royal cabana for one of the days we spent on the terrace. There was an option of hiring the luxury cabana but the idea of a bigger one sounded better. We were very happy we chose the Royal Cabana, 1 bottle of champagne, fruit platter and best of all oodles of exclusive, private space to enjoy the weather and the pool. I thoroughly recommend a royal cabana for anyone wanting to have a super special day on the terrace. 

A big special thanks to Timi one of the waiters who was excellent during our stay in the cabana. He was welcoming, helped us with all our requests, and was very professional, this young man is a credit to the Burj.

The Food and Service

One cannot stay at the Burj and not talk about the service, and whether it is actually 7 star. We can say that we have experienced 5-star service many times over in different venues and countries. Using the experience that we at the Burj Al Arab, we can categorically say that the level of service is truly superior to what we have experienced in other 5 star hotels and resorts. Not only did we have our every request responded to quickly, but we were also made to feel like royalty. If this is what 7star services is then we must have experienced it. 

Food-wise,  their breakfast is outstanding, the choice, presentation, and quality. I would expect to eat similar standards of breakfast, in Mayfair and Park Lane. Are the  food and drinks expensive? Yes they are! I paid £17 for 1 bottle of beer with my dinner, the same bottle could be bought for £3 in a pub in England..... but we were not in a pub in England we were in one of the most exclusive hotels in Dubai and therefore we pay these prices. 

We had a great stay, so much so that we will be planning our return. An excellent hotel and an excellent experience.","5","2021-05"
"The most luxurious hotel in Dubai","I was grateful to organize a business meeting in this most luxurious hotel of Dubai. Right from the planning to the final event, everything went so smooth and well. Absolutely courteous staff. Location is wow. The ballroom is one of the best and beautiful and I have not seen such a lovely ballroom in any hotel of Dubai. All our guests were so happy. Each corner of this hotel as picturesque location. The interior, the lightings, the carpets all are so well designed. It was indeed the most memorable and luxurious event of us. Highly recommended this place.","5","2020-11"
"Just  a class act","Definitely lived up to the billing. Pool was great except for a few posers  who probably had just booked a cabana to show off and were not actually staying at hotel. Aside from the pool posers/selfie instagrammers the hotel was great","5","2021-05"
"Repeat Dubai traveler","With so many choices for luxury hotels in Dubai this  was our first, and probably the last time we will stay at this property.  There was confusion and mistakes from the staff for everything we did.  On the first day the concierge never confirmed our Covid test.  We had to physically walk down to the lobby 3 times until someone actually called and fixed the problem.  At Sal, the pool we ordered food and were forgotten.   Our chair towels were removed while we were in the pool and chairs given to an obvious higher priority guest  accompanied with hotel staff in suits! On the last day we called for our luggage to be carried down.  No one ever came and we had to bring 4 bags down an escalator.  The front desk investigated and claimed the bellhop went to a room on wrong floor.  Completely unacceptable for the price and claimed 7 star service.","1","2021-06"
"Amazing building "," The building is more than beautiful, is elegant, Amazing. Everybody should Take a inside tour. The outside and the gardens are out of this World. More than clean, shining everywhre. Its excelent to Take some great photos in selfie mode or Take it with the panorámic mode. ","5","2021-05"
"Not worth it","Honestly for the price; the food was horrible, the bed was uncomfortable, the restaurants are crazily overpriced for already paying for the stay, and the transportation for a Rolls Royce is 800 AED but it’s from the 1900’s. It’s far from everything, so unless you’re planning to either stay at the beach or take a taxi every time you wanna go somewhere I don’t recommend it. The only pleasant thing is that the staff is very caring and welcoming, and the room is luxurious,","1","2021-04"
"Bucketlist hotel","Overall the hotel is incredible. Most of the staff is well trained, the food is great, the facilities are next level... not to mention the room size and it’s views.
The only way to find some flaws in it is because when you pay about 1500€ per night you expect everything to be perfect. And it would be perfect for almost every hotel on the world, you just expect this one to be the best.","5","2021-05"
"Perfection in a stay!!!","Stayed at many hotels around Dubai and Burj Al Arab experience simply stands out. A royal staycation in all terms. The staff was just impeccable. The butler service! Omar in particular was extremely helpful, greeting me by name and assisting me with all the details through from the moment we arrived until the last minute. The housekeeping staff was keen to the details. Everyone else I encountered was also extremely welcoming and made it a pleasure to stay here.","5","2021-05"
"Love love love Dubai and love Burj al arab ","Having lived all my life in Dubai it was a dream to stay in Burj al Arab.

Everything was amazing and staff was so classy. 

Rooms are elegant. Everything is gold plated but somehow blends in and never appears to be flashy. Most comfortable bed I have slept in. And the room is massive. 

Try the gold cappuccino. It’s so worth it. 

Service at the pools is on point. Many thanks to Pavlos for all the help. We had the most amazing  view. Loved the shisha it’s the best I ever had. Enjoyed the drinks, food and ice cream. Also many thanks to the lifeguard Sambit Sharma who was extremely watchful with our kids and all around. We had some time to ourselves and could enjoy the shisha. 

Many thanks also to Iryna Hoell. She was extremely kind and very patient with all the requests.

Housekeeping team is so awesome. We had some food for our baby which needed to be heated. We received it in 10 minutes. It’s next level Efficiency. Thank you narendra and everybody else. So many more names which I unfortunately forgot. 

My wife had a facial and she found it to be the best she ever had.

I used the bar on the top floor and again service was the best. What a collection of single malts.

Only feedback I would give is they need to have the kids club operational again since there is very little for the kids to do. My daughter though loved the pool so much I am not sure if she really missed it. 

Also very few restaurants are open so options are limited. 

Notice how many times I have used the word BEST? It’s no coincidence. 

There are so many small surprises which you need to visit to experience. 

Burj al Arab is an anomaly. It raises the bar so high there is no competition. Just like Dubai it will blow your mind. ","5","2021-05"
"A 7 Star worthy Hotel. If you want to be treated as the Royals, stay at the Burj Al Arab","Now I know why there is a 7 Star qualification, great service, most beautiful location and fantastic staff. Treatment beyond this World! 
This was our first stay in Burj Al Arab. We stayed here for our 25 Anniversary and really a celebrity or Royal couldn’t have been treated better. We where welcomed by the best Guest Service Manager ever , Melanie van Oevelen, there is just one word she does not know and that is the word: NO , everything was possible 24 hours she was there to help us and to advise and instructing the great Butlers, Omar Joseph and Eve (special thanks to their outstanding service and hospitality) It was so nice you packed our luggage. Thank you! 
Our stay was memorable, there were flower, flowers and more flowers, delicious deserts for the anniversary and much more. 
The hotel is like a fairytale, the Suite is for Royals and the Pool and Beach facilities are really the most beautiful I have ever seen. 
A must do and seen this property.","5","2021-04"
"Classic blinds with future","Have been a guest for over 10 years, never came shorter of a fantastic stay. For business or family. The staff courtesy is unmatched. They will always make sure you leave with gods memories..... this is a must if you can afford it ","5","2021-05"
"Fantastic hotel, friendly and helpful staff","This hotel is everything I expected it to be. There were a couple of items worth mentioning that weren’t up to expectation, namely, the service around the pool was slow at times and a lot of the hotel’s restaurants were closed and variety was limited which meant going out of the hotel grounds for meals. This didn’t spoil our stay here but for us this was a bucket list item and we wanted to make the most of it. Definitely recommend the Burj Al Arab! ","4","2021-05"
"The Burj Al Arab","What an amazing experience this was! It is hard to describe in words. We were warmly welcomed with refreshing, frozen towels and we were taken to our room in no time! The service was very quick. The room was so clean and everything was so good! Housekeeping would be done everytime needed. They would be available anytime we needed help. The food was delicious! Indeed, a very, very memorable stay. ","5","2021-05"
"Nothing prepares...even the documentaries","Celebrating a key birthday, we recently stayed. 
A few thanks and within these the review of our stay.
Vincenzo. You made us not only welcome, but comfortable and at ease from the moment we arrived.
Nothing I had seen or watched about the hotel did justice to the moment you are brought to your room and shown around. Thank you Maria. I might just have spent a couple of hours exploring and figuring it out. To those reading, the room under the staircase, Harry Potter’s room if you like, was something I excitedly discovered myself. The rest. Remarkable.
Sanjay, the fine chap looking after us on our floor, thank you.
Pavlos. There is so much I could write to you in thanks. You made us feel at home and always took time with us. Your advice and support while we enjoyed the pools, ocean views and food will always stay with us.
These four wonderful people are a part of a much larger group of people who were helpful at every turn. One just came to mind. The wonderful fellow at the Skyview Bar whose knowledge of whiskey…in particular a Port Ellen 8th release…I’m apologise, your name escapes me…really enjoyed our conversation.
My dearest was celebrating her birthday, a milestone one, and we both appreciate how everyone made her feel, coming together in an unforgettable stay. Thank you.
Having read some of the reviews posted here, I can’t help but feel that some guests do not understand what the Burj Al Arab 7 Star branding means.
It doesn’t mean Elizabeth Taylor’s entrance into Rome from the film Cleopatra.
It means exceptional service, in a timeless and effortless manner. 
It means you feel at home in a sublime and unique environment. 
It a little piece of heaven on earth. Eden.
Our sincere thanks to everyone we met at the hotel for your hospitality.","5","2021-05"

"Exceeded expectation","Checked in today to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. The hotel has exceeded expectations in our opinion. Anderson at the Pool bar/pool is great! Nothing is too much trouble.
Everything just amazing.","5","2021-05"
"Afternoon Tea","As we could not afford to stay here and wanted to see what the hotel looked like we booked afternoon tea. As the restaurant is near the top of the hotel we had superb view as all tables were next to the window.

All the dishes were well presented and tasted lovely, we even had a small steak pie. This was a one off treat and can truly say it was worth it. ","5","2020-09"

"Impressive to say the least","Living in a 5 star resort in Dubai myself, I have to say the Burj al Arab is in a league of its own. Everything was amazing, From the start to finish. The staff were super super helpful like they were computer programmed to be nice at all times and they made my anniversary a beautiful memory. Special thanks to Kasi from in room dining and also to the amazing butler service from Esther, Hope, Bema, Fatima, Gurpreet. It’s a beautiful place to be.","5","2021-04"
"The best food and service in Dubaï","Traveling to Dubaï is a nice experience. However, if you want a unique experience go to Burj Al Arab for Dinner. 
We had a dinner tonight at the Al Iwan. The food is delicious but over all want was amazing is the service. Deena took care of us. Perfect service, very friendly but very professional. She makes you feel comfortable but special. 
I will definitely come back here for dinner or stay just to have Deena again taking care of us. 
I strongly recommend you to visit this restaurant and ask for Deena. You’ll have unforgettable evening.","5","2021-04"

"Disgusting service","Part 1. Introduction.
My name is Dinmukhamed Kuziev. For more than 10 years, every year (except 2019) I fly to Dubai on vacation and always stay in the Madinat hotels. I have stayed in all Madinat hotels. In 2021, I decided to stay at the burj al arab hotel for the second time (the first time I stayed at the burj al arab was in 2015).  Many friends told me that after covid-19 the service in Madinat hotels became terrible, but I have never stayed in any other Dubai hotels for 12 years, so I did not listen to anyone and went to burj al arab between March 30 and April 8  ...
Part 2. Living in Burj. 
P.S. I am writing this review from the first day of my stay, as I want to outline every day of my vacation and at the end to sum up the results of my stay at the Burj al arab hotel, where the cost of living the ranges from 1800$ to 3000$ per night.
1. 30.03.2021.: We (me, my wife and daughter) came to Dubai around 13.00, at 14.20 we already arrived at burj, at the reception we were asked to wait a little, since according to the standard check-in is at 15.00, in connection with which we were asked to wait in a restaurant after eating free  dinner.  I didn't argue, because I understand everything perfectly, but I already planned that at 15.00 my family and I would check in, and by 16.00 we could go to the beach and swim. We waited at the restaurant for almost 2.5 hours!  Several times we went to the reception, where they asked to wait a little longer, but at the same time none of the employees could say exactly how long to wait!  We were offered to check into another room, wait there, and then move to our main room, but I did not want to move from one room to another.  At the same time, the day before arrival, the guest service wrote me an e-mail, in response to which my wife additionally informed that we would be at the hotel at 14.00.  As a result, they made an upgrade to us, gave us a room on the floor above, but the check-in time was about 17.00.  My family and I did not have time to go to the beach and pool. I have a question: why no one at reception can clearly say how long it takes to clean the room? Is there really no timing?
2. 31.03.2021: we went to swim at the executive pool.  I want to say that the service was terrible.  I ordered coconut juice for my daughter 4 times (11.30,12.00,12.30,13.00) and in the end they still didn't bring it to me (served by a girl).  After bathing, when I came to the room, I could not understand whether cleaning was carried out there or not, since everything seemed to be cleaned, but at the same time house keeping for some reason did not turn on the air conditioner to refresh the room and also did not put new masks (only boxes remained  from old masks).  The concierge on our floor is gone for the second day.  Let's see further ...
3. 1.04.2021: I went to the executive pool at 9.40 in the morning. waited for the buggy at the reception for 15 minutes!  At the same time, I was not waiting alone, but next to me was a family who waited even longer!  I have a question for the hotel: why can't you always have one buggy at the entrance?  There is no concierge on the floor .... even if it was removed for the duration of covid-19, then why not contact the concierge through the whats app?
4. 5.04.2021: ordered a parcel with delivery, indicated the hotel, room number and my last name. The deliveryman brought the parcel at 13.30 to the hotel and left it at the concierge near the lobby of the burj hotel.  at 18.00 I asked to bring this parcel to my room.  We searched for the parcel for almost 1.5 hours.  at first concierge said that there was no parcel, then when I clarified in detail the time of delivery of the parcel from the delivery man, concierge said that they had found it.  although the delivery man wrote my room number and surname right on the package. 
5. 8.04.2021: I'm leaving today.  I called the reception, asked to send someone to help with the suitcases, waited 10-15 minutes, called the second time and asked again.  the concierge had already called and said that a car was waiting for me below, so I asked for the third time to send me someone to help me with my luggage

BONUS: all 12 days the top of my room was undergoing renovation, and the sound of the drill was heard as if it was being drilled in the next room.  the sound lasted 20-30 minutes every day for all 11 days.

Part. 3 Conclusion:
I would like to say that it is a pity that this year the service in Madinat, and in particular Burj al arab, disappointed me very much. I decided that I would start traveling to other countries and watch, as I realized that after the coronavirus infection, Madinat hotels need time (several years) to restore the level of service and comfort that they provided to their guests ...

"Unbelievable experience ever  from 7 star hotel","First impression:Day called for hotel board line to reserve a table shockingly the lady hanged up the call while I was talking,called again was promised u will get an call back from manger which I didn’t got so I had to call again,called three times just to make an reservation!

Secondly felt welcomed when arrive to hotel from lobby 

Me and friends went for evening tea in lobby lounge .
Staff was polite yet no attention with guests ...

Again shockingly coffee served before the meals.
I felt like I’m not at all in burj al Arab ,there were no vibes at all .

Unbelievable found flies on table pictures attached 
I do have videos too !","1","2021-03"
"There is actually 7 star service ","I was wondering what makes a hotel 7 stars.....now I know....it is perfection.  Everything is perfection.  From the moment you walk in and are greeted by several people waiting for you to the moment you check out, everything is considered and implemented perfectly.  The room takes your breath away.  We had a King room, and it was two stories with an abundance of space and a floor to ceiling breathtaking coastal views on both stories.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable, the bathroom was very large with a hug jetted tub and large shower with multiple jets and the room offers all the electronics and gadgets you would ever think of.  The staff consider everything for you - a porter showed up to get our bags when we checked out before we even called.  The staff at the Skyview bar were so friendly and eager to please.  Even though some of the restaurants and stores were closed due to COVID, you never once felt like you were missing anything.  Actually, it was quite nice to feel like you have the place to yourself.  It was quiet and peaceful.  I was originally hesitant because of some of the recent reviews, but our stay exceeded all of my expectations and I would encourage anyone to go!!!  ","5","2021-03"
"Spa ","I was often in this spa during my Holliday. 
Thanks you so much for the service from « Chao » very attentive and answer about all the request. He is working for the spa on the 18th floor. Very good man. Best regards and see you soon. ","5","2021-03"
"Unforgettable day...","Magical place & delicious food. Monica took care of us, she is the best. After all she made my day by making me a present a Burj Al Arab beach bag. Thank you for your hospitality, and your kindness. I highly recommend to ask for Monica when ever you are planning to go, she is the sweetest ...","5","2021-01"
"Burj Al Arab","The worst hotel for the money spent! We expected a 7 star service instead received 1 star. We were told the seats by the  pool were first come first serve only to find out after an hour of sitting that they were reserved.  Admitted to their mistake but still kicked us out. Unacceptable!!! The service overall was the worst I have ever experienced for such a highly rated hotel.","1","2021-03"
"Amazing stay, with a lot of positive vibes","Upon arrival we were not happy at all with the way we were treated at the front desk. We arrived at 1 am and we were told that to get a room we have to pay for a whole extra night. Furthermore, we booked an option to get a possible upgrade. Nobody even tried to give us one. Even though, they had 75% capacity only due to Corona nobody tried to find a solution for my unhappiness.

On the next day my mood changed due to the amazing service of the Concierge Mohamed Refaat. His attitude was super positive and he arranged me in all the restaurant I needed nice tables. He was putting a lot of effort into it and was super helpful. I was always able to contact him via whatsapp, which was super helpful.

Furthermore, the Butler service was one of the best services I experienced so far. They are 24/7 reachable. Very supportive, helpful, friendly and trying to arrange everything. Even things which are not very standard, they are trying to set them up. Thanks to Matteo he name, we had a very pleasant stay.

At the Pool, on the first day I experienced some ""NO's"". After calling the manager, I got each day the sunbeds of my choice and heard never a NO anymore. Furthermore, I got afterwards the best service, while getting the water I wanted, the drinks I requiered and so on.

At the SAL Restaurant Anastasia was amazing and made our evening very special.

But there is always a BIG BUT...

In the Al Muntaha restaurant they didn't want us to provide us with the table the concierge booked . Than we wanted to order the menu for one person and the manager told us that it's only possible for the whole table, while not even trying to make us happy. The main waiter who is taking the orders was super unsupportive, unfriendly and not helpful. When I said that the dessert was not delicious his comment was ""probably you don't like honey"", instead of changing it or providing something else. Neither the service nor the food was not even 1 Michelin Star !!!!!!

To sum up one can say, that the service with little exceptions is fantastic. There are a lot of really nice people working, which are trying to make your stay relaxing and unforgettable.","4","2021-03"
"Guest","The service received at The Burj Al Arab was nothing exceptional. We have never received such extraordinary service. Iryna was amazing she booked us a cabana at Sal pool within seconds of realizing our room wasn’t ready which was perfect. We were able to begin unwinding immediately without feeling like we had to kill time waiting for our room to be ready. Iryna made sure our special occasion was memorable. She notified the restaurant of the occasion and upon returning to the room we had another lovely surprise. Everyone should experience the magnificence of the Burj Al Arab","5","2021-03"
"Best place","I would love to visit every weekend. Everything seems perfect there and staff is so kind and good. just waiting for another weekend to have some good drinks and food. Thankyou for making good experience ","4","2021-03"

"Birthday at Sal Burj Al Arab","Visited Sal the beach club at Burj Al Arab on my birthday ! It was absolutely amazing, from the food to the staff to the service overall! Special thanks to Robert for being so kind and attentive. 

I would definitely come back anytime !","5","2021-03"
"Beautiful stay in the hotel","My family and I have been coming to Burj Al Arab since 2001. I was a little girl and remember looking at the beauty of the building inside and out, during the day time and at night, in absolute Awe! 
I can say only one thing- 20 years later nothing has changed, your heart still skips a bit when you see this beauty! 
Today my Burj Al Arab experience is as breathtaking as it has always been. The service is exquisite, everyone in the hotel is there to make your stay very special- from the entrance team that greets you with open arms to top managers that casually talk to you asking if everything is to your liking. The amount of genuine kindness and warmth from the team makes the stay absolutely gorgeous and unforgettable.
I would like to say a separate Thank-You to our fantastic front office Director Irina, she touched our hearts during and after the stay as we are still constantly in touch; and Pavlos- outlet Manager of restaurant Sal, who has been there for us every day, making sure that everyone as happy as it is humanly possible.
It is wonderful to feel very connected to a place, and it is even better to have a connection to the people who make this place even more special. 
Can’t wait to be back next year.","5","2021-02"
"AWESOME 👍","I would recommend for any travellers.We will be back again.wounderful stay . friendly staff.hospitality 100%
Food delicious various choices breakfast / lunch / Dinner.
No hesitation every single we had awesome.what you pay what you will get definitely.Thanks","5","2021-02"
"A must experience","Every traveller owe it to themselves to experience the quality of the service and of the amenities of Burj Al Arab even if only once in a lifetime. The food at Al Muntaha and SAL is simply sublime. The pool and private beach are a true treat.","5","2021-02"
"Very nice tea","We had an excellent tea time here.  It was much nicer when it was upstairs but it’s closed up top during the pandemic.  The hotel is as great and as beautiful as it could get.  We will be staying here next time.  Great vibe outside at the pool as well ","5","2021-03"
"Exception facilities and service at the Burj","I discovered one of the secrets of exceptional experience we got at the Burj!
There is a lovely little family at the Burj. 
This family are talented, warm, caring and if you are lucky enough to stay at the Burj they make you part of their family too. 

Given that the Burj is one of the beautiful and iconic buildings/sculptures in the world; with a seven star accolade you may be forgiven for thinking that the Burj might have adopted and could have been forgiven for adopting a more pretentious style of guest service. Yet quite the opposite. 

The leadership and indeed every member of staff, have created a wonderful beautiful and warm culture that is the very fabric of the Burj. 

The team - who surely wear the most stylish uniforms in the world - are all dedicated to creating your own unique personalised and magical Burj experience. 

We had two wonderful people in particular who made our stay to an exceptional level. 
If I was to write a mathematical formula for exceptional guest service it would go Simona + Julia = World Class Guest Service x 100

All the staff are amazing! The Housekeeping will have each inch of the two storey glamorous suite gleaming. The beach team will have the most comfortable beds ready for you to swim in the saltwater infinity pool. 
And if you are lucky enough to have a buggy ride with Ezekel from Kenya you will have a belly laughing journey with his wit and a wonderful humour that will have you smile all day. 

We had some epic foodie experiences. You can see and feel the complete passion love and talent that goes into every morsel of food at the Burj. From the delicious canapés to scrumptious breakfasts. 

As a successful business woman amongst many who stay at the Burj I was interested and impressed to see women at the Burj rising through the ranks towards leadership. 

So thanks family Burj! We miss you already and we look forward to seeing you soon. ","5","2021-02"
"Worth It OR not ?","Q1: How likely are you to recommend us?
A1: It is very unlikely that we would recommend Burj Al Arab stay to anybody who would want value and peace of mind for the money they will spent. We have stayed in quite a few 5 star properties across Middle East and the experience in other properties at considerable less price has been really memorable and peaceful.

Q10: How satisfied were you with the overall thoughtfulness and personalization of services during your stay?
A10 : With the amount you pay for staying at the hotel, it is definitely not worth it. I feel highly disappointed with the overall experience and why I made the decisi0on to celebrate my daughter’s 1st birthday at this hotel. I feel with much less, I could have much better and enjoyable experience, rather then spending half the time each day in following up with people to request service.
Also, some of the restaurants were closed, which we wanted to explore, especially the one with the Swarovski celling.","3","2021-02"
"Sharing Experience","It is my pleasure to stayed in 7 star hotel in the world. I would love to go back again and by this time,  i will bring my daughter. My stayed 3 days and 2 nights was very memorable and meaningful and nothing to compare to my other travelling experience.","5","2021-02"
"Amazing!!","we stayed here with our teenage son to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was a great experience. They had arranged a special cake, flowers and decorated the master bedroom and bathroom. We had been upgraded to a room on 20th floor and views to palm from the room were amazing. We saw the beautiful sunset from our room itself. Very good food during the breakfast and at the pool site. Very nice staff. Enjoyed our stay here and would love to come back!!","5","2021-02"
"Once in a lifetime","It lives up to its 7 star rating! Amazing suite. A real treat. 
2 storey suite has ever bit of luxury imaginable. Definitely try the butler service and ask for the hot tub to be prepared - amazing! A fabulous stay got a romantic get away.","5","2021-02"
"7 stars just Exaggerate","In hospitality field there are touch points between the firm and customers one of these is reception ( check in ) took a while to find a room in excuse that the reservation made lately which was disappointing!!! During COVID-19 most hotels respect the rule of last customer check out the room should be out of service for minimum 1 day which mean rooms should be available otherwise no need to give the green light to do reservation through the website. Check out was another story and I confirm if I had the chance to use all services in Burj alarab I will be disappointed more , unfortunately you pay just for the building while the service quality is RIP, this is jumeirah unique icon hotel which should reflect the luxury hospitality but even the motel hospitality wouldn’t be as what I had in Burj alarab. ","1","2021-02"
"Most amazing hotel stay and a very romantic proposal to my fiancee","We booked the Burj Al Arab for a Valentine's day: had a Rolls Royce tranfer arranged, Suite with a sea and city view, romantic Valentine's Dinner in the room complete with 5 courses meal, rose petals everywhere, flowers, champagne, Couples Spa experience the morning after and a cabana was offered to us to lounge by the pool.

An amazing hotel, very modern and well  maintained despite of its age. Everything looked opulent and fabulous, and the staff made all possible efforts to make us feel at home while also very special.
Suites are huge and very well equipped, even allowing a wonderful in-room Valentine's dinner in our private living room. In-room Jacuzzi was also fabulous.

The Pool experience was great, not too busy, spacious cabanas, loungers, butlers, great food and drinks.
The Spa is amazing, very beautifully styled and overlooking the whole of Dubai.
The overall resorts is amazing and would keep you busy for a week easily. We stayed before in Jumeirah Al Qasr and all beaches, restaurants and facilies are very massive, and absolutely romantic. Also has a great fun waterpark included in the resort.

Last but not least is the staff who made every possible effort to make our Valentine's very special: Rolls Royce transfer, rose petals everywhere, and they even helped me pulling to most romantic and beautiful proposal to my fiancee.

A truly special hotel and resort. Thank you all to make this a special stay!","5","2021-02"
"Amazing moment !!","The best place in dubai for sure !!
Great service with a special thank you to Anderson. He was very professional and very kind
Food is very good. The pool is amazing. I will come back for sure with my family ","5","2021-02"
"Desapointed ","I would report my desapointment of my last stay in your hotel. Based on my previous stay and high standards of service, I decided to spend a few days again in your hotel: 
1: Rooms needs some refreshment, specialy bathrooms getting oldish and few thing like light and miror  ( rasor miror with a weak light is useless) join and furnitures needs also sole refreshments..
2 / service at breackfast was EXELLENT but this is not the case at poolside..one or two of the poolboys smell not fresh.. and one or two were not realy prone to take order .. even one told me, better go to application and pass your order!!! In this Covid period, the blue towell and cushin cover were not change between the morning occupancy and afternoon different person occupancy!!
3/ service at room: being in the room, I had the visit for turning down.. I ask them to come back later 10 minutes because I was on my way to go out dinner.. when came back later, nothing have been done..!! 
4/ having done a covid test for my departure, and not having the result after 24 hours, ask the receptionist at front desk, she called the concierge and said they will follow it and let le know.. having no news in the afternoon of 31th January.. i have been told to check by the concierge.. my surprise : he was not aware of this follow up.. he called the VIP doctor and told me he will follow it personaly and come back toe before 6pm.. having no news by 7 pm, I went to the concierge who was changed by the mean time.. he was not again aware of any follow up!!! So I stood there till he call again and finally could get the result and printed out ..
5/ I also asked for a late check out, because of my late flight.. would have exept a resonable extra charge specialy in these times that there is far from a full occupancy.. Noway: 1/2 room price till 6pm and full charge after that!!  Finally they accept 1/2 price till 8pm!! 6/ same time I asked them to book a car for the aeroport at midnight after my dinner in the hotel..as I don’t need a Royce Rolls, they booked a Lexus .. confirmed oraly by two person at the desk..when paying the bill at 19:30 , I even ask can I pay the car on the total amount of my bill.. have been told by the person of charge to whom I paid the total amount of my bill, that I had to pay in the car.. what was not my surprise at midnight that there was not any car booking.. !! 
the top of this was that same persone who recieved the bill payment saying, she thought I booked the car myself!!! How come could I have booked by myself and ask to pay the hotel!! 
6/ when checking out and giving my luggage, I had a hand bag  , which suffered during my first flight with a small hole.. so I  asked the bell boy to put a stik on it... when at the airport, i descovered that that havn’t been done.. I was not really expecting to have all these desconfort.. you can not call it 7* hotel, with high price and having that such of lack of service which is a basic sevices in a 5*hotel..
After more than 2 weeks didn’t get any feedback from my remarks ","3","2021-01"
"Close to perfect","The main advantage of the hotel - its huge luxury suits with outstanding view. The service is good but sometimes annoying. Every evening the housekeeping starts to knock, ring and call the phone every hour. If you choose not to open, they enter the room. We couldn’t overcome this obstacle for a peaceful rest)) a lot of restaurants are closed now, among them the underwater one(( no own sea beach, you have to go on buggy to nearby hotels, but there is a nice beach near the swimming pool. The staff are attentive and polite, a lot of russians. The best reasaurant is Sal near the beach. Spa is excellent, the therapists are real professionals. ","4","2021-01"
"stay at Burj","Very over-rated
I guess it was meant to be special - but everything was average.
Check-in average, gym was ok, most things were closed, e-butler was ok when he responded - but that was not very often and always too late. check out was so delayed - that we nearly missed our flight. Concerge was not helpful.

I guess when you pay a high premium - you expect high standards... not the Premier Inn standards - which i have to say have been fantastic recently","3","2021-02"
"A Rare Experience  and Highly Recommendable","Being a 7 star hotel is well deserved, more than my expectations, 18th Floor infinity pool and Jacuzzi is superb, bed and blanket is so comfortable, room technologies to make sure the comfort of the guest is superb, Jacuzzi in the room is one of a kind experience, staff service especially Mr. Immanuel is one a kind warm and homely service. Terrace Pool is magnificent, breakfast is so amazing, Overall  rate of 10, Highly recommendable,","5","2021-02"
"A must","It is expensive indeed. But it is worth it. I booked the sky view suits and we were upgraded to 2 bedroom suit. My son was thrilled about having his own room. The hotel was very clean and luxurious and staff were very friendly and helpful. I will go back for sure","5","2021-02"
"Stunning View & Extraordinary Service","We visited the terrace at Burj Al Arab after our hotel recommended it.  The food was superbb, perfectly grilled fishes with very nice flavors. Our waiter Emil gave us an amazing service and recommended some nice dishes. The views from the terrace are unbelievably beautiful over the infiniti pool, especially during sunset.

The best recommendation ever. We will for sure visit again and maybe stay in the hotel during our next visit to Dubai.","5","2021-01"
"SAL Pool","It was an amazing experience especially with the most helpful waiter (Robert from Kenya) always ready to accommodate when you ask for any service in or out of his hands he is ready with a smile to welcome any guest.
The pool and the location is a wonderful experience. We look forward to visiting again to be offered this exceptional service!!! Way to go SAL !!! We really recommend this place.

"Amazing service!","My wife and I went to the pool for a day. We enjoyed the experience fully . The service from all the staff was incredible especially from Anderson. The food, hospitality and the little details from Burj Al Arab was beyond expectations.","5","2021-02"
"Great experience","We were with day pass twice at the beach and  lunch there,  in the future we would like to  spend at least one night in Burj al Arab. The beach is very cozy and the Food is very tasty, also the service, staff was beyond expectations, I think our waitress name was Monica at the Sal Restaurant, she made us feel  very welcome. Also amazing sunsets  🌅 from the beach.","5","2021-01"
"Afternoon Tea","I had AT in Sahn Eddar and it was amazing! Foie Gras sandwich is apsolutly delicious and I loved your honey cake! Asim and manager Kristina made our experience very special and they made sure that we remember every part of the afternoon spent there!","5","2021-01"
"Amazing stay at Arabian Colosseum","I had great time in this Iconic hotel . The new area with the infinity pool gives to all the hotel an unbelievable charm. The restaurant Sal is one of the best in down at all. The butler service was Underestimated , but considering the situation due the covid 19, understandable.","5","2021-01"
"Burj Al Arab is now a 5 /4 Stars Hotel","It was my third and last time in Burj al Arab. Absolutely Caos at arrival, no butler available, the room wasn’t available at 15:00 of our arrival. They didn’t apologize. Every time we ask for some service they don’t even now how to react. We had to wait almost 20 mins for a golf car to pisco us up, etc....","2","2021-01"
"NOT 7 Stars...4 Stars at best!!","Save your money and stay somewhere else. The Burj Al Arab today is NOT the same Burj Al Arab that was synonymous our 7 star level service. 

Poor communication prior to our arrival - non responsive to email requests about transportation

Amenities- Hermès Perfume and cologne. Bath salt — asked since Tuesday

EButler is slow to respond, sometimes unhelpful, and it’s very impersonal. I asked for help booking a helicopter tour and they simply sent me a link to book it on my own

Pool service was slow — took a long time to find a seat — once we found a seat, I had to walk around and find someone to give us towels, It took 30 minutes for the shisha to arrive, and when we asked for the bill, it took such a long time that my wife and I left. 

Late checkout — denied after attempting to contact eButler twice","2","2021-01"
"Great service at Concierge Desk ","The services provided at the concierge are amazing.  I called from NYC to make a very special birthday celebration - Mohammed Refaat, one of the concierge’s did a fantastic job organizing dinner, and decorating the room with flowers, balloons and a cake.  He  made sure everything was provided as needed to the highest level and made me believe I was the most important person to him. He did everything in his power to make the birthday celebration memorable.   Great service.  ","5","2021-01"
"Good experience","My first time visiting burj Al Arab. The lobby is great with great and professional service. The pool is one of its kind. Will definitely be back. I had a visit in the park at jbh its just so wonderful.","4","2021-01"

"'My' Fallen Idol","They say 'never meet your idols'  because they often dont live upto expectations and thats how I feel about my recent stay at the iconic Burj Al Arab. My wife and I had stayed at this hotel once before and it was everything we expected - 12 years later we cannot say the same.
This time we travelled with my eldest son and his girlfriend and 1 year old son plus our youngest son (11) and I fully expected to give them all a great and memorable experience in one of - if not THE most iconic hotels of the world and not withstanding the fact that the hotel had recently re-opened because of Covid - it was just one problem and one dissapointment after another.
We were slightly suprised on arrival to our room that it was virtually, if not completely identical to when we were there 12 years ago and although the rooms and contents are of a high quality evrthing was undoubtedly looking tired and several things needed to be fixed or repaired or at least tidied up. Our TVs didnt work and had to be fixed - one was sorted same day but the one in the bedroom tok 3 days and it still didnt work correctly. We had a really anoying leaking tap that took another 3 days to fix and several more irritating issues as well.
We had issues with the cleaners who would turn up to clean our room 'after' we had returned from being out by the pool all day - when we tackled them, they turned up before we had even got up!! 
The concierge offered to book us some restaurants - firstly they took our requests and didnt let us know if they were confirmed or not then they booked for the wrong number of people - leading to a couple of embarrasing situations one of which led to us all being sat on a specially made up table right next to the toilets and in the worst possible area (but at least they managed to fit us all in after being told that there were only 4 of us not 6!)
My wife had another really embarrasing episode when trying to access Wild Wadi via the JBH entrance and being told that she wasnt a resident of the Burj (they had no record on the system) and as such couldnt get free access - instead being asked for a credit card or cash to pay - and while she stood in her bikini (obviously without cards or cash) the queue behind her grew until she was asked to stand aside - may not sound like much but she was really embarassed - the same thing happend when trying to charge watersports to the room on JBH beach.
The list of problems goes on and I can tell you that we didnt have a single day without multiple problems that originated from the hotel.
I was hoping that when we checked out I would get the opportunity to sum up my feelings regards the stay to a member of managment but was not even asked how my our stay was - they just took the cash- and you can imagine that it wasnt exactly cheap.
Then we found our return journey via hotel transport was booked too late and had to change it - youve guessed it....they couldnt change it and we were left to find our own way to the airport in taxis at a more appropriate time but at least we were gone!
You may think the story is over at this point and no firther damage could be done..but no.......on arrival the hotel reserves funds against your card - ours was deemed to be just over £20k GBP and when you depart they charge you the exact amount and adjust it against what has been reserved (or something like that) I found when I looked at my banking after returning home that not only had they charge me nearly £20k on departure the £20k was still reserved I had no access to that cash until it was eventually released after several emails and over a week after we got back - fortunately it didnt effect me but some families could have been badly effected by that appalling lack of care.
I was sent a survey about a week after we returned and filled it out in detail and let Jumeirah know that I would like to see some sort of response from them but.....your in front of me now - NOTHING.
Jumeirah...you will lose your exhaulted position if you are not very careful. If anyone would care to call me I'd be happy to discuss but I doubt I'll hear from you and as such a good and regular customer to Jumeirah hotels will be lost (look at my record Ive stayed with you 20+ times) and this is how that is rewarded!!","2","2020-12"
"Stayed before, used to be amazing. Not now","Considering this hotel costs 2800£ a night, i expected it to be like it used to months ago. 

Check in time
Took forever, we spoke to over 4 people at check in explaining our issue, our booking was for 2 nights but they kept saying it was for only one night.
I had all confirmation emails and also tried to reach the hotel by phone for days with no luck.
When we arrived we even though the hotel may be closed as we didn’t hear back on emails or phone calls.","2","2021-01"
"Amazing Hotel in Dubai","We have been for the third time in Dubai and this time wanted something more special and have chosen Burj Al Arab for our stay. The Hotel is one, if not, the best that we have been ever. The view from the room can‘t be described in words and the food is very tasty. The complete staff is very professional, we have been welcomed very warm from the reception and at the restaurant Sar we have been served by the exceptional Monica! Thank you very much for everything Burj Al Arab, it was amazing!","5","2021-01"
"Does not live up to expectations ","Expecting a so-called 7-star experience you walk into the hotel feeling excited about your stay.  Instead, what you get is a 4-star experience at its best: 

1) lobby is extremely loud, between all the loud mouths walking around on the phone and the tourists you can barely hear the receptionist. 
2) reception desk is tiny and crowded with both staff and guests 
3) Rooms furniture is worn and apparently been there since the hotel first opened 20 years ago
4) pool and pool deck is way overcrowded and gives you the sense of being in a water park, not in an exclusive hotel. Apparently they sell entry and it isn’t reserved for guests.
5) in the evenings the lobby seems to be full of women with a certain illicit look

All of this you could overlook maybe, but where the hotel really fails is:

1) public bathrooms near the pool are hard to find, but when you do find them you are met with the most abhorrent smell inside. 
2) room service quality and selection of food is barely 2-stars. At breakfast we had only one option to choose from, and being in Arabia we wanted to eat something Arabic but nothing! The food all had the distinct taste of being in a frier. ","2","2021-01"
"Stay at the Burj Al Arab","The hotel is highly overrated and 7 stars raises expectations that they cannot meet. Apparently, the Covid situation had resulted in losing a high percentage of staff which reflected in every aspect of service. They have a way to go to get to even 5 stars let alone 7. Yes the engineering and architecture is unique but that makes the hotel a one- two night stay at most for the novelty. Certainly not worth a repeat at the prices they charge for normal periods ","3","2021-01"
"Good place to Stay for New Year ","Excellent hotel with good service overall.

Rooms are to a very high spec and butler are very attentive. Place is incredibly clean.

Service is Brilliant, very peaceful and private hotel.

Breakfast is excellent lots on offer and service again is amazing , food is good , chefs are very accommodating and try to cater for all. Room service is just fine and try to do all for you. 

Spa is excellent, good staff and very good treatments for all. Spa facilities are very nice.

All staff , from door man , conceirge , reception and everyone addresses you with your last name and they surely remember all.

New year eve it had excellent celebrations and worth a visit .

"Sal Beach Club Outstanding","This is my third visit to the Burj al Arab, this time to experience the outstanding beach club, Sal.

We were shown to our sun beds by the welcoming staff, complete with luxury towels, pillows and iced water. Complimentary delicacies were served throughout the day by the friendly staff.

The resort was immaculately clean and COVID safe and we were  genuinely welcomed by the staff who also took some photos for us.

Although this is the most luxurious resort in Dubai, it is not at all pretentious like some other resorts in Dubai we have experienced and we felt completely relaxed throughout the day.

The food and cocktails were delicious and good value as fully redeemable from the entrance fee paid.

Attention to detail is what makes this resort stand out, as a commercial interior designer I appreciate the little touches that make a big difference. The changing cubicles had their own individual rainfall showers, luxurious toiletries and towels and were immaculately clean.

Outstanding again, thanks to all the staff for a memorable day!","5","2020-12"
"Awesome experience!","Experience is topnotch and you wont regret the cost you invest in staying in the Burj. The amenities and the location is really well beyond expectation. The room we had checked in is so clean that its like brand new.","5","2020-12"
"Not meeting expectation","We stay 4 nights and it was far from meeting our expectation:
- room were never clean on time and not at all in one of the day we stayed there
- room are outdated and we had several issue in our room with the ac, plumbing, etc.
- Butler was always confused and unhelpfull to the point we were simply not using him as everytime we requested something they either forget about it or not deliver on the request.
- we found the overall staff miss knowledge or lag of training in guess services
We ended complaining to Anna the guess relation manager which was very helpfull however the damage was already done and we decided to check out early as this hotel in our opinion and experience was far from what they claim to be a 7 star hotel.
On a positive note, Ibrahim the phantom driver was very good and helpfull. If there is anything, this guys should be promoted to butler, he was by far the best staff we meet during our stay and he was very knowleageable of the city, activities, etc.","1","2020-12"
"SAL AT BURJ AL ARAB AMAZING!","Sal at Burj al Arab was incredible, the food and ambience. Me and my partner were served by Ali who was INCREDIBLE, he was extremely enthusiastic and helpful. 

Overall, the whole beach club was amazing, clean and perfect.","5","2020-12"
"Dreams are Made","My husband and I stayed here for a few nights on the 16th December. For 20 years living in Scotland I dreamed of staying here. Over the years I stayed in many other hotels in Dubai but could never take my eyes off The Burj. It really was a dream come true and it certainly didn’t disappoint. Actually had tears in my eyes walking round our suite. The staff are absolutely superb inside and out and I honestly cannot fault this magical place. It will now be a yearly visit as once is never enough in heaven. ","5","2020-12"
"A 20-Year-Old Dream Fulfilled ","To make a long story short, 20 years ago, I remember hearing about a magical, almost mythical place: a 7-Star, best hotel in the world...the Burj al Arab. A friend had told me about it and we would talk and daydream about going there one day. I can recall even having photos of the structure as my desktop wallpaper and would also cut out pictures to put on our dream board. Well, I can easily say, that this 20-year-old dream has finally come true, not only fulfilling a bucket-list goal but surpassing the expectations we had thanks to the hospitality and kindness of the staff from not only the Burj al Arab but everyone at the entire Madinat Jumeirah compound. 

Without ruining any of the surprises nor going into too much details about what to expect (based off some of the past reviews, every stay could be different), we really enjoyed our stay and have become huge fans of Jumeirah properties and look forward to visiting their other properties around the world. When it comes to your dreams, sometimes you just have to find out for yourself. We can honestly say there’s nothing like staying at the Burj al Arab and the other Jumeirah Properties in the area, each with its own unique experience and ready to create amazing memories for you and your loved ones. We traveled with our two children (7 and 1 year old) and the staff really went out of their way to make them feel comfortable and special with in-room surprises for them daily.  

We would like to thank these exemplary people for making our stay at the Burj Al Arab one we will never forget: Tristan, Anna and Ermanno from the management team, Charles from concierge who always welcomed us back with a smiling face and high five for our 7-year-old, Shim the lifeguard and  Mohammed, our server at SAL. 

Sheikh Mohammed should be proud that his vision has come true. While the crown jewel of Dubai, the Burj al Arab, has been around for 20 years and they continue to renovate to keep up with the times, the legendary icon still continues to shine thanks to its staff, management, and everyone you come across. The hotel is beautiful and mesmerizing in person, however, it’s the kindness and the service of the people from management to the housekeeping, the engineers, the lifeguards, butlers, receptionists, buggy drivers, security, spa and gym employees, restaurant staff, and everyone else from Jumeirah that make the Burj al Arab unforgettable and a special and unique place to visit. If you’re on the fence about the price tag of staying here, rest assured, this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will be worth the price and worth the wait. Mashallah! ","5","2020-12"
"Best hotel in the world","It is the best hotel in the world, the architecture is extraordinary , the service is perfect, staff is so professional and kind, special thanks to Maxime ( 🇫🇷  ) at the restaurant, also Max ( 🇦🇹), and Georges( 🇬🇷), we felt very special everyday.

"Sal - utterly disappointing, what a waste of money, ghastly experience...","We booked Sal on the basis of reading the excellent reviews below, especially for my friends 50th birthday, but I feel like we must have gone to a different restaurant to everyone else, as our experience was appalling for this level of fine dining establishment.  We used to live in Dubai for several years so are very familiar with many of the good restaurants, and I now feel terrible that this was my suggestion to my friends husband for him to book as a special birthday surprise.  Firstly I must say the place is stunning, and our welcome was great, we were offered a choice of table and the initial service was excellent.  The first course was superb. It all went down hill from the moment whilst eating our starters that we asked the waitress to delay our main courses being cooked.  No problem she said.  So you can imagine our surprise when as our starter plates are being cleared, we see a little queue of waiters in the hallway holding plates, which were then instantly brought to the table.  We politely pointed out that we had asked for a delay, and were told by a male waiter we had to have the food now or it would be ruined.  My friends husband pointed out that we had asked for a delay, we were full from the starters and we wanted a gap before the main courses came.  The waiter said you need to eat these main courses now otherwise I can’t guarantee you will get the same quality.  We were absolutely dumbstruck by this, and again politely said that we were happy for the dishes to be cooked again, he then told us we should have these main courses now, and he will see what he can do about offering us a free desert.  We said no thank you we will be too full for a desert, in any case we asked for a delay, and we didn’t expect to have to argue about it at a 7;star hotel.  To which he said “so you want them cooked again?”, we said yes, and he literally rolled his eyes, sighed, said OK, slapped his thigh and walked off with the food.  The four of us were shell shocked, both the birthday girl and I train customer service and hospitality in the aviation industry, so we are extremely experienced on how to manage issues and turn them back into opportunities.  All I can say is I will be using this as an example of how a top level establishment can get things so wrong.  After this no one came near us, except the one girl pouring the wine and the water.  We had worked out who the Manager was, especially when she came and cut up and served our sea bass, something she didn’t do for any other guest, at no point during this direct contact moment did she acknowledge the issue or apologise that we had had a poor service experience.  After we declined desert, the girl who obviously got lumbered with dealing with us brought a pavlova to the table with a candle and Happy Birthday Karen, no other staff joined in with this birthday moment.  In fact no one at any point wished my friend a Happy Birthday, despite us having informed the restaurant in advance.  After paying the hefty bill (as expected in a fine dining restaurant), my friends husband asked for the Manager.  It took her 15 minutes to come to the table, and whilst she was then very apologetic, it was of course way to late for this.  In this level of restaurant, our hiccup with the timing of the main courses could have so easily been dealt with by an immediate apology, an immediate offer to retook the meals, an offer of a drink on the house, a visit during the meal from the Manageress.....it’s not for us to have to call her at the end, and then wait 15 minutes??  Utterly utterly appalling as the situation could have been rescued at so many stages during the evening, but was never addressed.  The Manager finally invited us back for drinks at a later stage during the week, but we felt we had already given Sal enough of our hard earned cash, and going back there for drinks would probably mean eating there again, and we have zero confidence that we would have a better experience.  Jumeirah I know you only opened this a couple of weeks ago, but you should have your best staff in there showing off your premium levels of service........NEVER again, I am just so embarrassed that this dire experience was due to my suggestion.  We went to Maine in JBR the following night, an old favourite of ours, the evening was exceptional, fabulous food, amazing service, half the price, and such a joyful experience after the previous night, pity we didn’t go there the previous night instead.","1","2020-10"
"Sal pool and restaurant","We went there to celebrate our 7 year date anniversary. Like we thought it was the best place that could host this day for us. Shahid made sure the experience was special by upgrading our rose to a champagne and getting me flowers with a cake. Miguael served us at the pool, he was very prompt welcoming and helpful. 
The music was soft yet flowing, temperature was relatively cool as the infinity pool is by the sea, the private cabana gave us the privacy we needed. During times like these cleanliness and hygiene was kept at its peak by many workers ensuring the large area is constantly sweeped. The food at Sal was delicious! We went for the prawns in the starter and the sea bream and lobster linguini. This experience is making us want to go back again and again. The hospitality really made it feel like home away from home. Thank you Shahid and Miguel","5","2020-10"
"Honeymoon","I go to Dubai every year but this time had to stay somewhere extra special with it being my honeymoon. We split the stay between Burj al Arab and Dar al Masyaf.
We both thoroughly enjoyed it the stay from arriving and being welcomed to be shown our room. 
The amenities are fabulous 😍 
The staff are lovely and very friendly. 
The sky one bedroom suite was amazing and the butler we had was very attentive.
I was disappointed with the selection and layout for breakfast as in the Dar al masyaf they had a huge selection where as at the Burj it was quite limited. 
Thank you Burj al Arab for a lovely experience.","5","2019-11"
"Sal","Sandeep served us at lunch and did a great job! He went out of his way, in my opinion, to get me a great glass of wine.Thanks to him for making the birthday special, beach and pool is so relaxing and v nice ambience.","5","2020-10"
"Sal was gorgeous","We spent the day at SAL, and it was one of the most relaxing experiences! Robert helped us out on the beach and tended to our every need, making sure we stayed hydrated in the Dubai heat. The restaurant's food was extremely fresh and tasty, and the service was friendly and fast. Additionally, the view of the infinity pool dipping into the ocean was very peaceful, and the sunbeds had the most comfortable fluffy pillows. It was all-around fantastic value for money, and I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone who needs a staycation!","5","2020-09"
"Sal","We had the most amazing time in Burj Al Arab - we went to Sal - a new beach that opened up - Robert was the most amazing waiter we could ever hope for/ he made the day amazing !! I highly recommend Sal - and I highly recommend for anyone going to ask for Robert he is amazing , sweet and made our night!!","5","2020-09"

"Amazing High Teas","This experience was out of this world. The whole visit was top class. The venue, scenery, food and service. 
The pie was amazing as was the cucumber sandwich (although I could not fault anything) 
The big surprise was a birthday cake which they kindly made for me which not only surprised me but my wife also.
Totally unforgettable and highly recommended 

Thank you all for a great experience and fantastic memory ","5","2019-12"
"Nice hotel","One of the best hotel in the world !!!!!!!
We appreciate the service the quality of food and the amazing pool with perfect view. We were a couple with 2 children: 4 years and 7 years. 
We recommend this hotel 100%.","5","2019-09"
"Luxury experience  of a lifetime","Our stay at the luxurious Burj Al Arab was absolutely magical. A total splurge for my 50th birthday but worth every single cent as we take wonderful memories that will last a lifetime for my husband and I. I find it hard to articulate just how incredible our stay actually was. 

Upon arrival we were greeted out the front of the hotel by the most professional friendly staff and the check-in process with Julia Schneider was seamless. Julia the guest relations manager went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay was absolutely perfect. She was gracious and warm and such a beautiful genuine young woman. 

Every single detail from the RR hotel transfers, mind blowing room, amazing air conditioned pool cabanas, the indoor and outdoor pools and by far the best  hotel breakfast ever!! Bunches of roses delivered every day, even to our pool cabana for my birthday  and birthday cakes/treats to our room every night.  Our entire stay actually felt quite surreal.  

Only downside is that I know that no other hotel experience will ever compare. Highly recommend. Treat yourself and stay, you will never ever regret it. 

Thankyou for everything Julia !! Our experience was made so special because of you. 

Thankyou Burj Al Arab !! 

Looking forward to visiting again","5","2019-09"
"Amazing landmark","Amazing and beautiful landmark of Dubai. Really a beautiful hotel and atmosphere. Good customer service and experience. View from inside is also a different experience. Love this place. Food options are limited bit limit if you are fond of spices but otherwise you will like it.","4","2020-01"

"Afternoon tea and behind the scenes tour!","Wow! What can I say? This hotel is legendary. It is beautiful and on arrival you are made to feel like celebrities!
Afternoon tea was beautiful, staff professional, courteous and on hand before you could sip your tea. We would absolutely recommend this experience for families and/or couples. 
Much to our surprise the team at Jumeirah Al Naseem had arranged a private behind the scenes tour of the BAA aquatics. And wow!!  This was our favourite experience during our stay in Dubai. Why? The team were amazing! They took so much time with us and showed so much pride in their department/work/team that we were left in awe. We left feeling like we’d made new friends, our autistic son had all of his unusual questions answered in great detail and with a passion to share our experience with others. I’m only sorry that I didn’t take the time to leave this review earlier.
Jumeirah you have an amazing team behind the scenes!!! Thank you Gerhard Beukes and your wonderful colleagues.","4","2019-07"
"Beautiful Hotel, Mixed Service / Vibe","Stayed here for one night in May 2019 to get the 7-star experience. The hotel was absolutely stunning. I was a little concerned from the photos that the rooms might be a bit too gaudy/dated but they look much better in person than in the photos. It is definitely a very beautiful and extraordinary place. 

There were many small touches that make the experience very special. We loved the burj al Arab slippers, flip flops and beach bag, the full range of Hermes toiletries and small treats in the room. 

We had dinner at Al Mahara which was truly exceptional- food, ambience, service was all amazing. 

Unfortunately some things were left to be desired. I don’t know if it was just the time we visited ( Ramadan) but it felt like the hotel was basically completely empty, almost deserted. I might have seen like 10-15 other guests total. That made it a little awkward. 

The check in process was bumpy. I was asked to pay even though I had already prepaid for the room. That took a while to sort out and come off unprofessional. 

The hotel touts it’s butler service which we were excited for but it completely under whelmed. 

After check in we looked around the room and noticed a half drank bottle of San Pellegrino in the mini fridge. How do you miss that?

We brought this to the butlers attention and told him it was like that when we checked in and it wasn’t us who drank it. We got a new bottle but were still charged for the half drank one that was already in the room. I would have complained about it it weren’t for the fact that we were not charged for other items we did in fact consume. Someone is clearly not doing their job properly. 

Otherwise we didn’t hear from the butler and most of the time he wasn’t even at his desk on the floor. 

Overall I would say it’s worth to try it out but I can’t imagine staying for an extended period of time, especially for the price. ","4","2019-06"
"Best hotel suites ever ","With 7 years staying here in Dubai UAE, I must say I had a lot of great things to be thankful for, for having a job I love, nice colleagues and lots of experiences as well... From dining in a fast food chain, buffets at different hotels and restaurants, some goodies and gadgets. Having a night stay experience in hotels, 3 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars... But my hotel stay at Burj Al Arab is one of the best indeed, its a dream come true for me. Even though I was not given the date I wanted, still I managed to stay with my friend Sarah Yu-Julve Santiago
And here is my review for my perfect night stay. 

When visitors come to Dubai for the first time, most of them want to see two things: the Burj Khalifa, and “that seven-star hotel”.

They are talking, of course, about the Burj Al Arab, the sail-shaped structure that sits on its own man-made island off Jumeirah Beach. The hotel that is so fancy it doesn’t have “rooms” – it has “suites”. The hotel that is so exclusive it has its own helipad. The hotel that is so attentive to guests’ needs that it has a 24-hour butler service and a staff-to-suite ratio of 8:1.

Basically, this is a hotel that is so luxurious it was somehow deemed beyond the regular five-star rating system for hotels.

By the way the ""Gold experience is indeed true"" 😁 you will be blown away indeed. 😉😜

I would love to thank Ms. Abigail from Talise spa, who showed us how we can enjoy the Spa at Burj Al Arab, Mr. Asmad who helped me operate the jacuzzi inside our suite, and the best ever Mr. Shubham, our butler whose customer service is very excellent. 👍👍👍

Thank you American Express Middle East

"Culinary Flight","Make the most of eating in 5 of the Burj Al Arab’s fabulous restaurants. The food was amazing, the staff were attentive and nothing was too much trouble. The views and experience was amazing. Each restaurant had its own style, staff were ready for our arrival.
Whilst it was a set menu there were a couple of choices for each course.
They even brought out a birthday cake for my friend (notified in advance).
Highly recommend ","5","2020-03"

"Excellent hotel and excellent service!!","Even with all these pandemic problems it was a pleasure to be staying with you !! 
The quality of the hotel impresses everyone!!  
We definitely want to return to enjoy 100% of the hotel!! 
The pool and the view are sensational!!","5","2020-03"
"Great couples weekend!","Me and my wife celebrated my birthday at ""The Burj"" in january. We had a nice stay but there is room for improvement. Our butler could have been more helpful and we didn´t get as much treats in the room as last time we visited Burj al Arab.
It´s a spectacular hotel, the views from the sky bar is great, the restaurants are all fine. Not many hotels can arrange for a Rolls Royce taxi, a great way for a little extra romance. The gym is outdated and needs new equipment, the breakfast could have more and better options.
We will return to Burj al Arab, there is something special about the place.","4","2020-01"
"Breathtaking stunning brunch and hotel!","We were only two tourists in the restaurant for brunch! No waiting no reservations and I am sure this was once in lifetime experience and a huge 55th Anniversary gift! We were treated like a royal couple and certainly feel that way with the surroundings. Unbelievable place to spend quality time for something special. We were welcomed to heart covered table and a beautiful rose! The food was delicious and dessert! There was no rush for us to leave so we enjoyed lovely staff, tea and our view of the gorgeous Persian Gulf! We shall never forget our morning in the Burj Al Arab! We will return to this magical hotel on our next visit to Dubai! Thanks again for your hospitality!","5","2020-03"
"Afternoon tea","If you are in the area you need to visit and book in for afternoon tea. It is truly amazing.  Get dressed up as this is probably the best hotel you will visit. We went as a large party and the service was perfect","5","2020-03"

We visited here for afternoon tea and it was amazing, ambience, food, staff etc.... the best.
It clearly shows why this is the best hotel in the world.
An absolute unforgettable experience.","5","2020-03"
"Great","Great experience. was glad to discover that Jumeirah has adjacent facilities and restaurants and dining options from around the world, under their ambits, a shopping complex, boat rides children's sections and activities further enhancing the variety and stay experience","4","2020-03"
"Live up to its reputation","I’ve stayed at many 5 star hotels in Dubai so it’s easy to get picky and spoilt as there are so many top hotels.  The Burj al Arab looked a bit over the top and dated and we weren’t sure about staying there at all.  I’m glad we did as it did, for us, live up to the hype and price tag. 

Firstly, it’s a fortune, however you’re paying similar if not less than you would for any other 5 star hotel’s presidential suite and that’s basically what you get.  So I think the value is there for those who are comfortable with dropping so much on a hotel.  Also the price gets less the longer your stay is.  

The hotel is dated in parts such as the spa and fitness centre looks its age and some of the room facilities like the switches next to the bed do nothing and the bathrooms are old now.  But it’s almost part of its charm as the hotel is iconic and a monument of when it was built at the turn of the century. We appreciated that and all of the over the top bling it had.  

It had a great atmosphere around the place and very relaxed and friendly.  We loved the buggy service and the amount of restaurants around as well as the fantastic private beach over the bridge we had lunch at.

A few small niggles:  The hotels pool area is lovely but children are allowed to run wild and scream which really did spoil our, and other guests’ time there.  The infinity pool should be adults only.  

The butler service was very poor for us.  On 3 occasions I pressed the button and nothing.  On all 3 attempts I then called for what I wanted and was told the butler would come and nothing.  I waited 30 mins for an iron and board (there should be one on the room) and nothing.  I think they need to look at how various requests are managed and not just assign everything to one butler who cannot cope with the demand.

We got a panoramic suite which is a bit bigger than the rest.  There are 2 on each floor and they have a view of Dubai as opposed to just the sea.  It also gives you breakfast which was excellent although the staff seemed stressed and rushed a lot of the time and not happy in their work.","5","2020-02"
"How have I resisted for so long","Wow Is the first word that springs to mind  but this is not a hotel for you if you are worried about spending money.  Service second to none from the minute we stepped out of the car.  We had utilised their Rolls Royce transfer which comes with a music menu. Cold towels and water was offered snd scented face spritzers 

We had taken the one bedroom superior room. It was huge. With a beautiful staircase. A butler is stationed at the end of the corridor to help with anything we needed including room info. Dinner reservations. Lounge snd bedroom have amazing  views  electric curtains and drop away tv in bedroom. Shower is huge snd bathroom fragrances are all Hermes. Bath I could do breast stroke in and was a jacuzzi. 

Chocolates on the pillow at night. Bottle of non alcoholic drink provided. Stocked chargeable bar in room.  So many comfy setters to choose from. Bed huge with very deep topper and a pillow menu.  

Outside lots of beds around the infinity pool. Come around with  fruit, ice cream. Deliver a bag to chairs with ice water and face spritzers   Each bed has electronic service box for food and drink deliveries

Spoilt for choice with restaurants. Went to restaurant on 27th with lovely views first night and one on lower floor alongside the floor to ceiling large fish aquarium on second night     Breakfast had a vast choice with very attentive service.  Why I have not stayed here   Before I don’t know.   That will be rectified","5","2020-03"
"Best hotel in the world","We stayed for two nights as part of a multi-centre honeymoon. The hotel is everything you would expect in terms of service, facilities, decor and the duplex suite is off the scale compared to anywhere else i have ever stayed. The experience is worth the money, it's top dollar but in return you have a 7 star experience you will never forget. The only criticism is the costs of food and drinks which i felt were excessive and would advise eating in the Madinat close by instead of the hotel. ","5","2020-03"
"Holiday","The hotel was amazing, the staff are so welcoming and very helpful and i suggest every one who wants to have an amazing experience to visit Burj Al Arab and they will never regret.
Thank you Burj Al Arab Team for wonderful work.","5","2020-03"
"Perfect Stay","This was our 4th and best stay at the Burj Al Arab.

We have considered other hotels in Dubai but the service and personal approach this hotels offers just cannot be matched.

We always ask for Aldrin as our Butler and he was faultless again. He is a real asset to this hotel and brings a warmth to the stay. Needless to say we will certainly be back again to see him

Our other Butler Alam was also fantastic. Nothing to much trouble for him. Aldrin and Alam certainly make a great team.

The pool service and pool food was also extremely good. Press the button and service happens straight away. Brought out in good time too.

All the staff seem to genuinely care about giving good customer service and they succeed at that very well.

The building itself is as breathe taking as ever. We even saw the outside fires 🔥 for the first time along with more Rolls-Royce than you can count!

If you are taking the hotels Rolls-Royce for dinner then ask for George. He’s very smooth on the road and polite.

Thanks for a great stay. Look forward to see you again Aldrin and Alam.","5","2020-03"
"Valentine’s Afternoon Tea","I remember when this hotel opened and I always dreamed of going there. This year was the year we jumped in and went to afternoon tea for Valentine’s Day, if your going to celebrate do it in style. 

All of my expectations were exceeded and we had an amazing time. It is pricy but you get what you pay for. 

The staff and service was out of this world. 

Thank you to everyone for making a special day more special. ","5","2020-02"
"Still a spectacular hotel but not quite good as before","This was me and my wife’s second stay at the burj al Arab. Having had an excellent 4 night stay here last year we decided to return for a stop over again. Of course the hotel and suites still remain a spectacular place to stay, however there were a few things that left us a bit disappointed.
The so called butler service seemed non existent. We never saw a butler or member of staff on our level during the whole stay. Also on returning to the room after dinner our tea cups and used plates were not tidied away on 2 occasions. For a supposedly 7 star hotel this is not acceptable.
They no longer give you complimentary Hermes perfume which is a shame.
The person who checked us in seemed very new, he didn’t seem to know how to operate the computer system and also told us we would be getting complimentary breakfast included, which we were actually charged for on checking out. 
He also did the check out for us which seemed to take forever as the computer wasn’t working. 
The infinity swimming pool seemed to have a constant presence of sea birds paddling in the pool and drinking the water, none of the staff seemed bothered by this.
Good points were the buffet breakfast was fantastic as usual. The food and atmosphere at Al  mahara and al Iwan were also fantastic and worth the visit.
The loungers are now fitted with a buzzer system for making orders and paying which is a great idea.
Overall I still loved the hotel but I wonder if they are cutting corners with the butler service and complimentary toiletries.","4","2020-02"
"Fabulous, nothing else","We felt like princesses in this wonderful hotel. Our every wish was fulfilled by the always available staff. We used the SPA and the wonderful terrace with swimming pool. The suite exceeded all expectations and our butler took care of us in every respect. 
You have to live such experience at least once in your life!","5","2020-02"
"This is a definite must go to place","During a stay in Dubai we wanted to visit this magnificent sight. However you cannot actually get inside the hotel unless you are either a guest or have booked an activity within it. So we decided to have afternoon tea. Now this is not a low cost choice but we treated it as a one off opportunity to visit. We arrived by taxi and were checked through security but only after we had produced our booking slip. The sight driving up to the reception is worth it and once we were out of the car it delivered everything you would expect from a seven star location. The welcome was very good and inside the front lobby was spectacular as was everything around and above it. We travelled up to the 27th floor for our afternoon tea and the view was breath-taking. We had a table just back from the window but had a perfect view of the panoramic layout of Dubai from the Burj Khalifa to the Palm. We booked tea for 4.15 so had the advantage of seeing the sights in the daylight, twilight and dark, well worth it. The afternoon tea was sumptuous with a seven course menu, every one delicious especially the heart shaped scones with jam and lemon curd (that was just wonderful).  After we had finished we could enjoy wandering around the public areas of the hotel and taking in the luxury of the surroundings. If you can go, you should. You will not regret it.","5","2020-02"
"No comparison","Day 1 and it really is awesome. 
The service outstanding.

"Uncomparable Royalty treatment","Unforgettable luxury experience, nothing but the best, treated like a King and Queen at all times,  Our stay exceeded our expectations in every way, from room to pool to French Cusine to the Spa . . . all excellent","5","2020-02"
"Best service you can get","If you want service come here, the reception team specially the head of the team in light blue uniform i didn't ask about her name unfortunately,my butler Mr. Alam was great, i will for sure return back . ","5","2020-02"
"A MUST-DO IN DUBAI","Unbelievable experience.  We had lunch here al fresco on my sons birthday and it was an experience I will never forget.  Food and service of the highest order. If you go to Dubai and don't experience the Burj you have just experienced an incomplete holiday","5","2020-02"
"Stunning - visit here definitely a bucket list","Visited with my family during a lunch at the Scape restaurant.  What an amazing, special place this is —- feels like another world.  From the time you enter the lobby, it absolutely reeks of opulence.  The building itself is architecturally amazing - never seen anything like it.  The hotel staff were super friendly and beyond courteous.  Definitely hope to return ","5","2020-02"
"Great hotel, super suites ... but it is really 7-star in terms of Customer Experience??","We tried all Jumeirah hotels thus far and the Burj was the last one on our list! Yes, we were very excited prior to arrival ... and although we didn't want to leave Dubai as a whole, we left the Burj slightly disappointed as we couldn't quite see the 7-star rating. Let me explain: When it comes to Customer Experience, the Burj does need to look at other properties of their own (such as Dar Al Masaf) as well as competitor hotels (Rosewood for example), that take Customer Experience to the next level. We just didn't get the same feel or treatment whilst staying at the Burj; there was something missing and difficult to put your exact finger on, especially if you are used to getting exceptional Customer Experience. One example is for instance the E-Butler Whatsapp service, which was more confusing rather than efficient. At the end of the day you are paying for 7-star treatment, but we failed to understand what the extra 2-stars really give you in comparison to the perfectly acceptable 5-star choices of the other Jumeriah hotels.   The suites are just stunning in the Burj; and the staff accommodated our wish not to look at the construction site of the new Marsa Al Arab development (if you don't know what that is, Google it, it is awesome!!). We may go back one day, but only if there are special deals going on .... I think the Al Naseem and Dar Al Masaf properties are still better options, especially for families, for your normal Dubai family holidays.","4","2020-02"
"hospitality","excellent staff, very cooperative. sweet was very good. food was delicious. other amenities was meeting to a higher level, overall we can say, the paid money is deserve. Had an excellent holiday and enjoyed. ","5","2020-02"
"The night here like 1000 anywhere else ..","First and before writing my review, I need to stress those words whatever so will be weak in describing the experience I had in this spaceship (as I’d love to call). It is a 2 decade age, but still, stands so far and a one (in my opinion) deserves 7 stars that usually claimed for. 

At the time your car passed into the gate, your name is recognized everywhere in the hotel. Your single-serve butler is assigned immediately upon the check-in process is completed. The response by staff during the stay like I have never seen anywhere else, very professional and so kind and all work hard to make your stay very memorable. Staff dedications and a genuine smile spread in their faces mean nothing than the employer seems to take care of and serve them with an edge-work conditions.    

The suite is like that essence we get used to imagine while reading the novel “ One thousand and One Nights”, the room is equipped with top-notch equipment, luxurious oriental furniture and stunning view like you are floating on the sky (TV sliding mechanism helps you to enjoy the view too). Apple Desktop, Hermes products, and train full of candies passing by in the night for kids proof the statement of luxury, uniqueness and value the money you paid. 

The top swimming pool needs a separate review, its lovely interior mosaic, and design, and the spectacular view makes you don’t need for the recently attached external pools.  

If I’d like to comment on something that needs real improvement and attention of the management, it is only breakfast. The breakfast ultimately doesn’t match only my expectations, but also by far the level of the hotel. Very ordinary, no live cooking, no variety and is located in a small space. I hope next time I booked with you guys, I find a more elegant breakfast serving that at least matching the restaurants in top roof.

Last, for everyone looking for a memorable, romantic night with partner, no way you can find better than burj al-arab, book confidently.","5","2019-11"
"A must visit in Dubai","This is claimed to be the only 7* hotel in the world and perhaps itnis.To be able to get in you need a booking to stay there or have a meal there. Grand entrance, very posh but smallish lobby. Some places are restricted if no booking. Can walk all round the outside of the hotel after your meal - fantastic views all round.
Lots of restaurants, bars, shisha places to choose from - both indoors and outdoors.

"Poor","I sent the below email a week ago, as I always feel any company should be given ample chance to make good an issue before simply jumping online and leaving a poor review. Burj Al Arab didn't even bother to respond.  This place really has gone downhill.

--

We have just returned from our visit to the Burj Al Arab and I am sorry to say we were left disappointed. 

We had high hopes for our experience but the afternoon tea service was at best, lacking.

 I felt we were ‘stuffed’ into a corner table and quite simply forgotten about.   The couple next to us (who came up in the same lift as us) were promptly served champagne and had their first course before we had even been offered a drink!

Throughout the service it seemed we had been forgotten about and were barely tended to. We were without doubt the last to be served at every opportunity. 

We eventually asked to be moved tables, as there were much better sited tables free (which had been free throughout service) as we thought we may get ‘noticed’ by your staff more. 

It was evident we were running behind schedule as by 18:00 we had only had our first couple of courses. The last courses were all brought out in the space of 5 minutes shortly after 18:00 - despite all of the other tables having had their food much earlier. 

I asked for an extra glass of champagne which never appeared.  We also had to stipulate dietary requirements once seated, despite making these clear when booking. We were asked if this was a special occasion (something we had again mentioned during booking) and whilst we confirmed it was to celebrate our recent engagement, there was no further mention of this throughout the visit. 

There was also fairly loud background music playing from a speaker right above our heads.  That in itself wasn't a problem, but the ""hiss"" from the poorly setup speakers was ridiculous. It was like the sound was coming from a 90's walkman plugged in on a 100ft cable!

Ultimately the food was ‘okay’ at best - certainly not the opulent ‘7 star experience’ the Burj al Arab promises. 

I feel any company should be given an opportunity to address concerns before I simply go and write a negative review, so I am interested to hear your thoughts on the above. Ultimately I am not impressed at all with the quality of the offering for the price paid.","1","2020-02"
"Heaven","Never had experience like that in any other hotels i loved everything as a local and a government employee i say this hotel has 7 star for a reason butbone thing that made me feel bad is that they refuse giving me additional 2 hours ","5","2020-02"
"Not the same experience as previous years at all","Looks like Burj Al Arab have decided to work to more of a budget. no extra special treatment or décor really for valentines day. 
Check in was rushed, there was no warm 'ritual' welcome like previous stays and the restaurant disappointed heavily compared to previous years","2","2020-02"
"Outstanding hotel","Memorable stay, every detail is taken care of and you can only enjoy such a beautiful and luxurious hotel. The suite with a breathtaking view, the mesmerizing infinity pool and the dinner at the royal cabana were outstanding. Loved every moment.","5","2020-02"
"Not just the hotel!  Night Manager Mr. Bilal. ","I have stayed at hotels throughout the world, this is one of the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed. But the most important part is the details of everything and the people. 

I made an error and showed up really tired a day before my actual day off booking in the early hours of the morning. 

The night manage Mr. BIlal was so accommodating and hospitable. He treated us with respect and asked us not to worry. He personally took interest in our accommodation and got us a room and offered extra amenities. An example of a true Arabian Hospitality. I am truly impressed and grateful. This shows the culture of the group and people he represent. Thank you 

Dr. Syed Ali. ","5","2020-02"
"One off the best","We had afternoon tea fantastic , We paid the extra for a window table which looked over towards the palms and the Atlantis Hotel what a view, the sandwiches and cakes we well made and tasty,staff were also fantastic i would return there again","5","2019-12"
"Cocktails with a view","Just back from an amazing holiday in Dubai. We've been a few times but never visited the Burj Al Arab before. We booked cocktails in the Sky bar, wow, absolutely fabulous! Service, staff, surroundings and drinks were first class, thank you you made us feel very special!","5","2020-02"
"Stunned Speechless","It took me awhile to write this one because there are just... no words to accurately describe the experience. The words just don't exist.  So here's the best I can mutter... The service level is regal, the suites are breathtaking, and the feeling that you get when you realize that you can afford this level of luxury? ... Blessed.  You thank your lucky stars that you have experienced this wonderful opportunity.","5","2019-03"
"Excellent Hotel","Stayed here for a week, it is as good as the hype, the customer service was exceptional, we had a panoramic suite and it was very well equipped, the food was top notch and the cocktail bar was a lovely setting for after dinner drinks","5","2019-12"
"7 stars dropping to 4.....","I've recently visited the hotel for the 5th time and for the very first time I was totally disappointed. From what I know there is a new manager on duty and probably he received a message to reduce costs dramatically. From the welcome gift, an 18 euro sparkling apple and date drink together with a standard fruit composition, to the butler that now is not anymore present at any floor but reachable via whatsapp the service is going down and down. In the past day the welcome gift was a bottle of champagne a box of dates in the shape of the Burj a box of chocolates and an orchid for the ladies upon arrival.Regarding the lacking of service just one example: one day we left our room at around 10 am and returning at 1.30 pm the room wasn't made up yet as a result of the lacking of the butler on the floor. As in other hotels now you have to call the housekeeping.
The bedding was a total disaster and as well the towels in the bathroom were old and tired.
The rooms as well shows the ages passing by.
As bear in mind that if you wish to have a late evening drink at the lounge bar above the reception you have to order before 10.30 pm as this is the time for the last order.....in a self proclaimed 7 stars hotel? This is unacceptable. 
To be fair I've been approached multiple times by a couple of managers to discuss the situation. They have since then provided a bottle of Champagne in room and one free transportation to an outside restaurant. In reality the free transportation were 2 but one of the two has been charged to my bill.
It's really sad seeing one of my favorite hotels going down so fast.","1","2020-02"
"Just drinks and canapes","I went to the Burj Al Arab hotel in November 2019 with friends. We were on a cruise of the Middle East and we visited the hotel just for a tour with wine and canapes. 
The hotel is amazing and is a sight all by itself. The wine and canapes were delightful with good top quality wines and scrumptious canapes representing Middle Eastern, Indian and European cuisine. We were high up in a lounge where we had a great view of Jumeirah Beach and the whole of Dubai.
I would love to be able to stay here in the future, but for now just for my brief stay of about an hour and a half, I can truly say it was a most rewarding experience.","5","2019-11"
"The Legend of 7star Hotel ","The legend goes in 1999 when the hotel opened a British travel writer who was invited to stay there was so in awe of the place that she described the great Burj  sa “seven-star hotel” And ever since the rating has stuck and I am not complaining. Experts say the Burj has the best butler to room ratio. We experienced is first hand , Issa and Tatiana ( hope I got the name of the new trainee on 20th floor right ) were ever so attentive and sensitive to all our needs. 

The rooms are super luxurious ( though slightly dated in decor ) , everything else is the same , super luxurious. 

The restaurant for breakfast was awesome , Emma and Abdullah were super attentive , taking care for all needs from coffee to a warm wrap on a super windy day .

Burj Al Arab residing luxury and how . 

Must stay just to experience it. We will be back ! 
","5","2020-01"
"Arabian Buffet at its Best","We did dinner at Al Iwan. Amazing buffet and as casual as it gets in the Burj al Arab. Great selection of food, lamb, chicken, beef, sea bass, mezze in all forms, great selection of drinks. If you like to drink gold, try the apple cider with gold flakes - OMG.
The chefs came out to the buffet to explain the dishes and help with selections. 
As good as it gets!","5","2019-12"
"Wow!","My husband & I planned our Anniversary trip in Dubai. We knew we had to stay at the Burj Al Arab. We now know why they are considered the “most luxurious” hotel in the world. Everything was amazing. We are looking forward to our next stay there!","5","2019-09"
"Real luxious experience","The room facility is very luxurious. The view is fantastic. A great view to the sea and to the Burj Khalifa. Love the view very much. The greeting gift is very thoughtful. The bulters and other staff are really friendly. We even had a rolls-royce to pick us up to the hotel!","5","2020-01"
"A little disappointed","Access to the hotel was inconvenient due to arrival in the morning of the Dubai Marathon. In addition, there are many cases where there is no welcome drink at check-in and there is no butler. The hotel facilities are a bit old, although the appearance is excellent. For outdoor pools, the water temperature should be adjusted according to the outside temperature. The day I stayed was a bit chilly and the water temperature was low, so I was dissatisfied. It's delicate whether it's worth paying this much money.","4","2020-01"
"LUXURY AT ITS BEST!","Its not  just the hotel is luxurious but the staff are so polite, prompt and respectful..

Hotel as its known one of the best hotels in the worlld and built on a manmade island posses beautiful amenities , restaurants .
","5","2020-01"
"The Burj as expected","The hotel is still an amazing place, great feel and great staff. Very satisfied with our stay. Beds excellent. The 2 story suites are incredible, the food excellent, views incredible and the 9pm fireworks fantastic.","5","2020-01"
"Exceptional Experience","A stay at the Burj Al Arab is an experience to behold.
The level of attention we received and overall attention to detail is amazing.
Every part of our experience was exceptional, from the service poolside to the restaurants, bars and butler service.","5","2020-01"
"Stunning destination","Really welcoming.. Experienced extra ordinary service from this signature luxury destination.. Private beach and.. The best part was that they will be picking you up on a grand Rolls Royce 😍😍😍😍 all day free Wifi available which is fast working and swimming pool is also really refreshing","5","2019-06"
"Dinner at the Iwan Palace restaurant","Best 4 hours of life. Treated like royalty from start to finish. Went there for dinner at (red palace) restaurant. Food options were incredible. So much variety. Service was good. Overall ambiance was top notch.","5","2019-02"
"Birthday dinner in Bab al yam","Highly recommend the buffet has everything you could ever imagine and live cooking stations. The perfect night out. It was my birthday and they brought a cake. This really is a must see hotel, honestly your will regret going to Dubai and not going here","5","2019-02"
"a Luxury Hotel with amazing Decor","The hotel is your gateway to Heaven, the lobby is so blissful. the rooms are amazing with service second to none. The outdoor pool has an invisible edge, the swim is lovely. Pool side you can enjoy snacks and drinks on request. Enjoy a nice drink in the evening on the 27th floor or have some shisha. the stay is one to remember.","5","2019-12"
"A pleasant experience","The hotel is nice, Homey, Homey, everything is perfect and I hope I can stay there again. Breakfast was great, the restaurant was in a good Environment, and I enjoyed my breakfast.The housekeeper was very friendly.","5","2020-01"
"AMAZING","topnotch service and quality overall. will visit again and again.luxury no other hotel can match.
need little more improvement on daily breakfast..same every day.hotel staff was excellent on customer service.","5","2020-01"
"Very expensive but worth it!","The hotel is very impressive indeed!  You are well taken care of from arrival to departure.  Everything you see is the best.  The rooms are luxurious and the size is easily three times that of other five star hotels.  The restaurants are generally good but overpriced in my opinion. Food quality varies depending on what you order.  Unfortunately, I happen to have chosen a couple of appetizers that didn't impress me.  However, having appetizers and first course of meal right next to a giant aquarium on the ground floor followed by the main course and desserts being served on the top floor was quite an experience. If the price charged were not too high,  the imperfect food quality could have been forgivable. ","5","2020-01"
"Afternoon tea of dreams!!","Spent my birthday celebrations at this stunning hotel, the staff catered to our every need, the food was fantastic! We will definitely be back, such a lovely experience , charming staff and beautiful decor ","5","2019-10"
"Poor","The rooms are made in a classic style, but did not remember anything. There is no modern content. Security at the entrance is too intrusive. Service should be asked several times to do commonplace things: bring luggage, bring fruit. The restaurant is a long line.","2","2020-01"
"The service of the staff is not good","The hotel is very nice but the staff does not know how to solve problems. They really need a lot of training. It is the most expensive hotel in the wolrd but our stay was very unenjoyable. I wouldn´t come back.","3","2019-12"
"A fantastic culture of service","This is the most opulent, amazing hotel I have ever seen in 40 years of travel.

Was there for New Years Eve. The Christmas décor and the amazing luxury of the 2 story suites was fantastic. Fireworks and the NYE event was great!

Great culture of service. Check in was seamless and the butler service from beginning to end was top drawer. Restaurant located in the aquarium was a worthwhile experience.","5","2019-12"
"Taxi back from hotel rip off beware","Just spent the night here in the sky bar. Excellent night beautiful hotel staff superb.
Problem started when getting a taxi back to our hotel.
You go to the entrance and the hotel staff call you a taxi (actually waiting there so they just motion it forward). No fault of the staff they actually said as we got in. Set your meter to the taxi driver, so we thought nothing of it.

Taxi to the hotel 35 that included 9 dinar for our hotel booking the taxi to come and pick us up. So when we got in 9 was already on the meter.

Taxi back 85 (he hadn't set the meter) I confronted the driver about this and he very quickly back tracted and I give him 50, more than I should have.

Beware even though the hotel tell them to set the meter, make sure.
lesson learnt.","1","2020-01"
"High Tea - Wonderful ","First of all the hotel lobby is second to none! High Tea location on the 27th floor is worth splurging for.  You definitely won’t need dinner on that day.  The view is amazing, the room is out of sight and the many courses of the High Tea is varied, well paced and gives the guest the sense that they are special.  
","5","2020-01"
"Lunch","A very nice lunch in the sun and experience, thanks to Mr Anderson who was our waiter who was personal and professional.
We did not get a tour around as we hoped, so thats the room for improvement for next time! 👌🏻✨ Looking forward to it.","5","2020-01"
"You have Hotels, and then you have Burj al Arab","What I like about this Hotel, is the ambience. The people working here are so friendly and attentive. And the Property is Just beautiful. The sun lounge is amazing. It is like entering a new world when you enter Burj al Arab  ","5","2019-12"
"Always great!","We often stay in Jumeirah properties and we never get disappointed. This time was even better as we got the experience of the new year and all the staff was extremely helpful with my children and wife. We will see you again very soon Burj!","5","2020-01"
"7 star hotel In Dubai","We loved our stay at the Burj al Arab . It’s not on the beach but you Can use  the other hotels beach that they own next door. We sat at the Infinity pool. We arranged a rolls Royce to get us at the Airport and show us around Dubai. We had tea upstairs which was very nice.  They give you amazing Hermès products that smell so good but they don’t want to give you more than 1 of each . The spa was ok not worth the money for a massage.  The hairdresser was good for a hair blow out. Each room and floor has a butler that you can text but they don’t always answer so quickly and sometimes are confused.","5","2019-09"
"Cabana Day","We booked a day in one the luxury cabana’s and it was by far the best day of the holiday. We pools and lounge area was so relaxing. The butler service was outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble. The drinks are the pool bar were the best drinks we have had, you can tell all the staff are well trained, so polite and friendly. It’s just another level. It is quite expensive at 2000 AED but it was so worth it! If your looking for a one off experience I would say this is a must. Only reasons I couldn’t give it 5 stars was that the pools could have been heated more as they were quite cold. Also the allowance of tourists walking to the pools from the restaurants. I understand that people want to see it, just like we did, but when your relaxing in swimwear and people fully dressed are walking up and down and taking pictures it’s not great. I wouldn’t be happy if we were staying there and this was happening. ","4","2019-12"
"Awful experience","Most over rated hotel . Completely lowest quality of service and facilities . Compared to other hotels in Dubai .
For the amount they charge it is totally not worth the stay . . The staff also are poorly trained in attending to customers.  The furniture in the rooms is old and uncomfortable. The telephone in the room is also old . We paid 3,000 dollars a night and got nothing for it except for standard rooms and poor service . ","1","2019-12"
"First Class","Stayed here for 4 nights. Suites are opulent. Full size Hermes toiletries, Dyson hairdryers, best of everything. Only downside is the amount of noise from Chinese tourists allowed around breakfast and reception areas","5","2019-12"
"Fantastic experience and still the best!","We stayed here for 4 nights and it was by far the best hotel experience. From the moment we checked in until we departed, the staff was on top of everything. This is the place to stay if you want to feel like a VIP, the service is impeccable. We also ate dinner at Al Mahara, their Michelin starred restaurant, and it was excellent. The bar on the 27th floor has amazing views of the city. Our personal butler, Paul was so helpful the entire stay. ","5","2019-12"
"Fantastic","Fantastic luxurious experience. Top notch service and great food. Looking forward to coming back. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and very clean . 
The cocktails are delicious. “The Staff was very very helpful and made me and my fiancé feel like royalty. Mr Aashrit was excellent assistance and a very helpful polite person. I look forward to meeting him again in the near future. Great experience. Thank you.","4","2019-10"
"Burj Al Arab","The staff were very attentive, the kids club was great for children. The food was excellent and had something for all ages as was the in-room dining.
Access to the Wild-Wadi Water park was simple and great.
Another great experience - cannot wait until the next one. ","5","2019-12"

The terrace is the place to be. NIce and relaxing. Beach close by, although you have to take an electric transport but does not take long.
amazing views","5","2019-12"
"Amazing rooms and service. Quality of food is surprisingly deficient.","Hotel is amazing. Rooms are extraordinary. Service is impeccable. Food quality is deficient. Do NOT eat at any facility in this hotel. It is too expensive for what you get. 
If you are planning to stay at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, then you will be able to eat high quality food at a lower price than in this hotel.","4","2019-12"

"service is excellent","The service of your hotel is excellent. But there is still has something to improve, such as it should be shorter for us to wait for the room, and the tap is too difficult to use, especially after washing hands.","5","2019-12"
"Day Cabana ","We hired four air conditioned cabanas for the day and we had an awesome day. The food was spectacular and the service was amazing. The view was beautiful as the pool faces the ocean. Next time I will definitely live at this hotel. ","5","2019-07"

One experience I wish to re-live soon.","5","2019-02"
"Possible improvements","The price doesn’t worse the service. Room service was extremely slow. The lobby was too crowded. Many facilities look aged. Very nice pool experience. It is wondering why it still charge $10 for a coke in the mini bar with $2000 room price.","3","2019-12"
"The best experience in our life","We have the pleasure to stay at Burj Al Arab hotel , we qualified this hotel 10 star not 7 star , they have the best customer service we ever had experience  around the world , we really recommend everyone to stay in this hotel  ,the extravagant and luxurious are indescriptible , the customer service unforgettable and amazing , we have a two bedroom suite and the number was 2008 with espectacular panoramic views to palms islands and Atlantic hotel , we really enjoy all the amenities  in the hotel , the only thing we didn’t have chance to do was the spad and the gol bar , we celebrated our 36 anniversary and we are planning to go back to celebrate our 50 anniversary, Stoning and unforgettable vacations  ❤️❤️","5","2019-12"

Hands down!  Their staff is very good and kind.  Always there to help us.  I definitely would want to come back.  ","5","2019-12"
"Amazing service and luxury cabana","We decided to book for a weekend day pass at the famous Burj Al Arab and zeroed on to the luxury cabanas but after experiencing them, they are more of rooms with private butlers than cabanas. The service was impeccable and the infinite pool is a marvel plus the overall ambience even though I was disappointed with the cocktails, the rest made up for lousy cocktails and the prices for alcohol and food even though expensive, they arent exorbitant as I had initially thought. For those looking for a crazy fun day and privacy, the Burj Al Arab terrace cabanas is the way to go.","5","2019-12"
"Best massage and spa experience","Really loved the staff their gentleness and kindness! professional massaging with nice atmosphere! 
we got offered a nice drink while waiting for the massage room to be set it took only 2 minutes!
in the end, the lady offered to take us pictures with the amazing architecture of the Burj !","5","2019-11"

"The most opulent luxury in Dubai style you can imagine.","The hotel titles itself like ""the most luxury hotel"". From six 5-star hotel I had opportunity to visit in UAE (Jebel Dhanna, Anantara Qasr AS, Pallace Downtown, Park Hyatt Dubai, Al Maha) it's significantly the most opulent luxury. If you are worth to spend money for 170 m2 suite in two floors, with double restroom, grand bathroom, own imperial style stairs, surrounded by gold color everywhere, this is your choice. If you add phenomenal external, but especially internal architecture - that airy open monster space inside of the hotel, perfect services of hotel background, you will get outstanding cocktail. To be in the hotel is experience. The hotel is the experience. From hotel services I would like to apreciate in dining service. I enjoyed steamed halibut a lot! I very hope for another but longer opportunity for next stay there :)","5","2019-12"
"Beyond Spectacular Stay!!! AWESOME!!!","Our Dubai vacation ended here for a three night stay at this absolutely beautiful, stunning hotel.
Words cannot describe the way this hotel is built for its class, style, decor, service, restaurants, and amenities.

Our room, 1410, was a deluxe 2 floor suite. Large entry doorway invites you into the massive foyer, with a large desk in the office space, a half of a bathroom, a large main  living room, leading to the overly spacious den and dining room, which was matched brilliantly with bright colors, both with beautiful views of Jumeriah Beach and the Ocean, and detailed for eye catching moments. All two master bathrooms were roomy, double sinks, a large two person shower, with three way shower heads and a relaxing jacuzzi. All the fixtures had beautiful gold trim, with details only a designer can imagine. And can’t forget the massive staircase that hugs the wall on a curve that takes you up to the bedrooms!!! Stunning!!!

Our butlers and floor concierge, PAUL and ISSA, who were both aces and so nice and informative, and “on the money” for service, questions, and issues. They both were spot on for their dedicated and top notch service!!! Thank you gentlemen!!!

The outside infinity pool was massive. With two large hot tubs on each side, plenty of swimming room or just relax and observe the stunning Arabian Ocean or tirelessly look at the towering hotel structure. Plenty of comfy lounge chairs in their man made beautiful “beach” with umbrellas or “shadow” some resorts call them, or if you don’t like sand between your toes, there is a area with a regular pool deck with another pool with a swim up bar. A large kiddie pool is also on the premises. Life guards at the pool areas to keep an eye out, and the service at the pool provides, nice and refreshing, cold towels, fruits drinks, an ice bag with four bottles of water. Awesome service.

The indoor pool and hot tub which was located upstairs, was a unbelievable sight. Decor and style only the eyes can imagine!!! Beautiful!!!

Glad to see the huge lobby that was draped in a silver, cascading beautiful Christmas decor surrounded by massive fish tanks on both sides and when you get to the top on the escalator, a matching colored 25 foot Christmas tree greets you and you can stare at it for hours. Amazing!!!

Great restaurants located in the hotel. We had a quick lunch at their poolside buffet restaurant called Scape, which was really good. And we dined one night at their signature seafood Eatery named Al Mahara and had Breakfast at Junsui which is their Chinese buffet. Both places were outstanding. Yum!!!

Can’t forget about having a cocktail or two at the Skybar 27 which was a great place to watch the sunset or have an after dinner drink. Thanks MARKY!!! Cheers!!!

Overall, stunning location, hotel, service, and decor. Great amenities, quietness is key here, they do not  allow outsiders or tourist in the hotel to take pictures or wander around, it wouldn’t be right and I’m glad the management doesn’t allow that.  All visitors are stopped at the massive gate and have to cross their bridge to the main doors. Buggy’s are key to get around the Jumeriah properties that they drive you around.

Our great UAE visit to Abu Dhabi and Dubai is a once in a lifetime visit. We stay in other nice resorts and hotels all over the world, but they all don’t match up to this place. Ending it here at Burj Al Arab is a check off the bucket list and was just priceless!!!

Thank you!!!
","5","2019-12"
"Spectacular!!!","We stayed here 5 nights here and were completely overwhelmed by everyone & everything!
We were on holidays and just come from a week in Masai Mara.
Arrival was amazing ever, We met wide awaked suited guy, who escorted us and outed to the awaiting Rolls Royce (around 60$ each side direct with the hotel - really worth of money!).
Can't get better than that, in the room there were fruits, chocolate, wine etc.
Restaurants & other services are naturally as expensive priced as the hotel. I'd recommend the room service and highly recommend the pretend - underwater restaurant, they have amazing Chinese and Seafood.
Pool area is excellent, services around that are water, drinks, umbrella move able/up and down ,towel, everything is spectacular.
If we ever went back here we would stay here again.
Thank you everyone for everything!","5","2019-02"

"View of the Burj from the beach","Most of us would dream to visit or stay in this much famed hotel but it is only for the rich and famous as outsiders can't enter the hotel.

The beach in the vicinity from which you can view this star hotel is the nearest you get to see the hotel.I would strongly recommend to see it at night in it's vivid colored lights and with the sea breeze hitting you.Its a great spot for photo shoots too.","5","2019-12"
"The Burj","Stayed here a few years ago just an amazing experience, top class every single phase, excellent suites, superb Butlers loved the whole experience. Would obviously recommend it is without doubt one of the worlds best.","5","2019-01"

- the employees are very attentive and friendly

- the suites are well furnished and generous
- Mrs. Sophie looked after us very well

- Food, especially in the Arabian restaurant was very good","5","2019-12"
"Wow!!!!","This was our 4th visit to The Burj. What a very very special place, friendly staff, everywhere was stunningly lavish, the customer care is their USP we were made to feel really special, nothing was too much trouble. Expensive? Yes but quality is worth paying for. We would rather have a few days here than 2 weeks elsewhere. A memorable experience. Magical.","5","2019-12"
"Best hotel in the world!!!","Over priced but you get what you payed for. Incredible stay. Would return for sure. 

The room is amazing with a view that take your breath away. 

Great pool with great service. In Dubai you have no better choice. ","5","2019-12"
"Birthday Cocktails at Gold on 24","This is my second visit to the Burj al Arab, thIs time with my daughter for birthday cocktails at Gold on 24.

The service, food and drinks were first class, in an outstanding environment. 

Our waiter was friendly and recommended cocktails that were both delicious and spectacular, a real treat for us both. 

We were given complimentary shots for my daughters birthday, also dramatically served with dry ice.

The food was delicious and service exceptional. Our friendly waiter showed us around the restaurants and took photos of us with the spectacular views behind.

Thanks again for such a fantastic experience, we will return but next time we hope to stay in one of the suites for the full Burj Al Arab experience.","5","2019-11"
"The place to enjoy sunset with great snacks at Escape Lounge","Was very thrilled and surprised by my best friends to celebrate my 40th birthday ! What a beautiful breathtaking place to chill. We had salad, pizza, coffee and they surprised us with a beautiful small cake. I was greeted the moment I stepped in to the burj alarab, 
Anish was a charming Doorman who greeted me and wished me a blessed year.
Kush hosted us at the Escape lounge was very polite and attentive plus very professional. He was very sweet to get me a beautiful tasty little cake to make my evening perfect.
Ahmed & Mohamed prepared the best shisha in town , were excellent to get my friend’s order but the only best. 
The Lounge opens at 4:30 pm and must have reservation to enjoy such beautiful place with high standard services. 
Thank you Burj Alarab to make my 40th birthday very special. ","5","2019-12"
"Amazing service incredible room","The best luxury hotel experience ever, from the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty with every member of staff wanting to assist and make your stay perfect. We were lucky enough to have a high room with views of the palm which I would say is the best view currently, there is a little development work going on the other side. This was the first holiday for my new baby and the hotel certainly catered for a family experience. I was at the hotel in August also and the pool was busy with kids although for this trip very few children and a quiet pool...less splashing around the pool bar 😁 we had great food at the hotel and at the surrounding properties, you are spoiled for choice. The Burj has two breakfast venues the European option which is nice if you want to sit outside and the Asian restaurant which in my opinion is a lot more interesting with a mix of western and great Asian food. This was our favourite and not very busy most people seemed to go for the safe European option.
If you are interested in Watching some sport on your holiday the sister hotel has an new English pub call Dhow and Anchor which was pleasant and serves English food. Every floor of the Burj has a butler who looks after you during your stay. We had Alam on the 19th floor who was brilliant and could not do enough for us. Also the lovely Simona made check in and check out faultless. I must say a massive thank you to all staff for helping us have the most amazing holiday.","5","2019-12"
"Gone Down Hill Badly","I find it hard to believe how down hill this hotel has gone in the last year. 
It should be classed as a 7 star, more like a 2 or three star. 
Service & food all gone down hill. 
Spend your money elsewhere is my advice.","1","2019-11"
"Luxurious Hotel which lived up to its reputation","The rooms were incredible and the views breath taking. I hosted a business event for 150 people at the Al Fayak Ballroom and everything went smoothly. The staff and service was excellent and my guests were pleased. I would love to come back and host another event there.

"Another Faultless Stay","A quick break back to Dubai staying at our favourite hotel Burj Al Arab.

Warm welcome on arrival from their team, the in room check is always a nice torch.

It was great to see Aldrin the Butler again. He has looked after us on previous visits and was faultless again. A pleasure to be looked after by him. We also had a Butler Zaheer who was also brilliant and kind. These two on the 15th floor did a perfect job for us.

It is a very nice personal touch when the butlers walk you to dinner or to meet your car. There is no hotel we’d rather stay.

The pool team and servers we efficient with drinks and food. Even cleaning sun glasses when required. 

Breakfast outside is nice and plenty of selection. Staff are helpful with gluten free options.

So another great stay and look forward to come back to see Aldrin and Zaheer next year.","5","2019-12"
"Anniversary stay","Had the most memorable anniversary stay at this hotel. 
Check in was made so easy by the friendly staff. 
Pool area was perfect with a swim up bar, numerous jacuzzis and a relaxed and chilled out atmosphere.
Rooms were beautiful and had the most comfortable bed and pillows. Rooms are also very well equipped and the bathrooms have the most divine smelling, full sized products.

Breakfast was perfect, with lots of choice and very friendly chefs to cook your eggs to your liking. outside patio area with great views. 
All staff in the hotel are classy, friendly and attentive. 
 
We chose this hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in style, and it most definitely met all of our high expectations! 

Will definitely be visiting again.","5","2019-11"
"Luxury and attentiveness raised to the peak","Burj AL Arab retains its title as one of the world's most luxurious hotel. From location to design, interior decor to suites layout, it hovers above the best. The attentiveness of the staff, the cuisine and much more transported our experience heaven wards. It's an act difficult to replicate. ","5","2019-11"
"Exclusive Pool Deck and Cabana","We have been coming to Madinat Jumeirah and the Burj Al Arab for more than 10 years , the pool deck and cabana is an absolute highlight and has been a great addition . Sammy is the most friendly and attentive person and has become a must visit, the perfect day starts a the cabana on the pool , Scape restaurant, Talise spa - you can also have massages at the cabana- and Ends at Talise spa","5","2019-11"

"I was definitely disappointed ","I have stayed at many luxury resorts in Dubai before but it was always on my bucket list to experience the ""7 star"" Burj Al Arab. We decided to stay here for 3 nights.
We had very high expectations for our stay, but who wouldn't if they're staying in the worlds only 7 star hotel?

The positives: 
The arrival was great and very personalised. We had an early arrival and the hotel were prepared. We were escorted to our room and the hotel had an amazing breakfast layed out for us.
The room itself is large and beautiful with an upstairs and downstairs. Including kitchenette. 
The room was also extremely clean, which is obviously super important. 
The hotel provides luxury bathroom amenities which is great. The kids were provided with their own sets.
The kids were also provided with their own gowns and slippers which was a very cute touch.
The water provided in the rooms were also great as they were in glass bottles and of good quality.
Each night a different treat was left on our beds, chocolates, lip balms to name a few.
The highlight of the hotel for my kids was the infinity. It is absolutely stunning and has a great atmosphere.

The unfortunate downside:
The kids club was probably one of the worst that I have ever been to worldwide. It's a tiny room on the top floor of the hotel with very little for my kids to do (ages 8 and 5). That was it. Kids clubs are very important at any resort we stay at since the kids spend most of their time there. This was not the case unfortunately. Definitely not a 7 star kids club. More like 2 star. 
Only after staying at the Burj did I read up on their turtle rehabilitation centre. It was not mentioned to us on our stay. It would have been something great for the kids to see and interact with. But as I noted, this is not a kid friendly hotel.
Breakfast was shocking. I just expected so much more. The breakfast buffet is very small and very limited. The staff are very unprofessional and unhelpful. They definitely need more training kn how to be more attentive to guests needs. I would order a drink and it would never arrive. I also ordered shakshuka. I was absolutely gobsmacked that neither the waiters nor the chef had any idea what shakshuka was and I was served scrambled eggs!!! They asked me what it is and even after an explanation they didnt care much and gave me scrambled eggs. (They could have even googled it if they wanted) There is no a la carte menu for breakfast. This would be expected of a hotel of this calibre. The waffle maker broke while we we there so no waffles for the kids unfortunately. Was no replacement available? I did mention to the manager available that the breakfast and service is disappointing. I guess there was not much he could do because nothing changed.
Each level of the hotel has it's own designated butler. Ours was usually unavailable or service was slow.
No one offered to unpack my bags upon arrival or to pack up upon check out (that's usually done at top resorts).
Upon check out I was billed incorrectly.

I'm sure that managers of these top hotels knows that it's all in the details. Guests staying at a hotel like this are not new to the game and have certain standards and expectations that have to be met. Attention to detail is important. Anticipating guests needs are important. Providing an all round great experience is important. 

I have definitely stayed in better resorts around Dubai. All in all, there was nothing that impressed me about Burj that will draw me back again. ","3","2019-04"

"It need for modernization","The old hotel with good service but if you want private rest it is not possible because there a lot of turists in the evening and in dinner. The good see view on a city and Pulm. Good dinner and breakfast ","4","2019-11"
"Breakfast sahn eddar 10/10","This is the lobby lounge 1 level up. I wanted a nice breakfast as a treat and Atmosphere @ burj khalifa is my normal preference for this but they were fully booked. Didnt have high expectations from here expecting it to be full of tourists but it was absolutely wonderful my best breakfast experience in Dubai.

Only couple other tables lovely and quiet (high season but a weekday) service was impeccable- the ladies just so lovely and attentive. Lovely touch was to first lay out NY times and a fantastic fashion magazine for me, I ended up spending 2 hours myself there lovely lengthy morning.

Ambiance was 10/10 - my last visit to the burj I wasnt so taken with it but just sitting in the lounge I turned my chair away from window view (also nice sea view and jumeriah beach hotel) just to look at the beautiful interior. Beautiful classic music playing and the water fountain very calming.

Ladies gave me a pillow for my back was very comfortable. 

Breakfast was fantastic value for money - at 220 with unlimited beverage this is amazing for Dubai in such a setting. I have a nut allergy but still the contenital breakfast menu was adapted, huge pastry basket, fruits, oats. I'd normally miss the eggs or hot food but didnt at all couldn't finish the amount even over 2 hours. 

Highly recommended as a breakfast spot, I am 9 years in dubai this very much impressed me.","5","2019-11"
"BAA was the best, not anymore","The cutting costs has penalized the care for the guests.
No more parfumes for both men and women, 
no private beach for BAA guests
don't go to Al Mahara restaurant, it doesn't worth
Maintanance needed as the structure has almost 20 years

"The best hotel we've ever stayed in!","This is the best of the best. We only stayed one night and its not cheap but worth every penny. An unforgettable experience and the rooms were breathtaking and a real surprise. The staff and service is out of this world. We wish we could have stayed longer and will save up and return one day! Thank you the Burj you did yourself proud!!!","5","2019-11"
"Jewel in the Dubai crown","We often stay at Burj Al Arab when in Dubai and it never disappoints. There are some outstanding food and beverage outlets providing the finest fayre and outstanding service to go with it. The terrace is fantastic for a day in the sunshine, and Gold a great spot for late drinks after a super dinner. A visit to the spa and indoor pool is always a must. On this occasion WiFi coverage was intermittent and there was a lack of amenities but otherwise a great stay.","5","2019-11"
"First Time Visitor","A Wonderful Experience of a Lifetime was made possible not by just the hotel and staff but by the positive attitude of the region and its hospitality toward travelers. This is certainly a hotel that I will look forward to staying at again.","5","2019-11"

"Didn’t meet our expectations","Didn’t meet our expectation. Definitely not worth to spent $1750 to stay for a night, even 5 stars hotel in Dubai is better. The breakfast did not have much choices, limited food. The furnitures, bedding are old. ","3","2019-11"

"My last day in Dubai I diceded to be un año Ivón of this contra it was in your hotel","My last day in Dubai after a good travel arround Dubai I decided yo be in an Icon of Dubai the Burj Al As I expected, the hotel is a gem, its very professional and helpful staff, I was convinced that finishing at Burj Al Arab was the best way to end my trip.","5","2019-11"
"Outstanding!  - A World Best","As you would expect, the Burj Al Arab is something truly exceptional. It lives up to its 7* claims and its fabulous reputation and actually exceeded our expectations.  

We stayed for 11 days. Service was swift, attentive and highly personal. Staff are unobtrusive, yet we were welcomed like a VIPs everywhere we went and treated with the warmth of family. There are no language barriers, it’s clear that all staff, whether housekeeping, chefs, beach staff, guest relations and management are all fluently multilingual.  The attention to detail is superb. The accommodations are lavish and fun. SO comfortable. Everywhere is sparkling clean. Security is very well organised. Management always present, available and ready to listen, help etc. 

No request is too much. I felt I could ask for anything and it would be no trouble. Guests are so well looked after.  Breakfast was especially delicious. We loved the  priority buggy service. You are even pampered on the terrace beach. 

With a staff so distinctive in their uniform excellence, it is hard to single out individual stars; but extra thanks go to Clarisse (guest relations), William and Joseph (butlers) for their thoughtful assistance in smoothing out all of our requests expeditiously.

We are already big fans of the Jumeriah Madinat complex, having enjoyed many good stays at the Dar Al Masyaf villas over the years. Nonetheless, the Burj Al Arab is something wholly different and highly special. It really is a cut above. It deserves its standing as a world best.","5","2019-10"
"Sadly disappointing","Poor quality amenities and cleaning not up to previous standard, ie stains on coffee tables and surfaces after the clean, however the staff were delightful, the hotel iconic and the newly created outside bathing facilities were amazing.","3","2019-10"

"Really 7 stars???","1. Dirty carpets
2. Waiters throughing drinks on the carpet and clean it with a tissue

6. Paid 1200 AED for the sky view bar and they placed us at the back where we could only see the tend of the hotel
8. All the aluminium frames were damage, corroded and scratched 
9. We asked for the car to be ready 5 mins before we leave as the valet ticket mentioned and we had to wait 20 mins for the car to arrive
10. The music was sometimes on and sometimes off if you could hear it after the sound of the barman while preparing the drinks
11. Wooden damaged drawers between the tables which was supposed to be invisible or at least 7 stars quality","1","2019-11"

Staff of course, fantastic.  My birthday was near the time of my stay, and the floor butler gave me a birthday card, with a cake and flowers.  Felt like a queen.  Go to the spa, it is another thing.

The restaurants are all brilliant,even the buffet had one of the best selections.At our age and well traveled we can say its one of our best overall experiences and are planning to return for our 50th Anniversary in 3 years time","5","2019-10"

"Spectacular hotel, if you don't need butler service","As you would expect from THE Burj Al Arab, everything is done to perfection.  From the Roll Royce pickup to the food at the hotel.  We stayed at the 3 bedroom diplomatic suite for our family vacation.  Of course, the kids loved the hotel with their huge rooms and all.  I am sure you are all aware of the pros of this amazing hotel.

The low point are the services at the hotel.  The hotel has introduced an ""E-Butler"" service which is a great idea, if it worked.  I have whatsapp-ed the service and requested a butler to come to my room for assistance.  No one showed up for 15 minutes and I contacted the service again.  Then 15 minutes later, the butler finally showed up in my room.  30 minutes is not an acceptable time at any hotel, not to mention THE ultimate Burj Al Arab.  

However, this is not the only time the service is subpar.  When I contacted the Operator and requested the butler to assist with my checkout process and the bell services for my luggages, again, no one was there for 15 minutes.  I went outside my room and flagged down the on floor butler, however, he stated that no one had contacted him about my requests.  He quickly helped with the checkout and requests for the bell services.  

We also had a private dinner at their signature restaurant, Al Mahara.  We reserved a private room for the dinner because we have kids under 8 years old and the restaurant policy does not allow the kids younger than 8 unless you are in a private room.  Okay, that's not a problem.  The food is very good and our family had a great meal.  However, it is the service that killed the otherwise a great dinner.  Maybe it's the culture of service that is different from my previous experiences at private dining or top tier restaurants.  On multiple occasions, we had to leave our room to flag down our server.  Towards the end of the dinner, one of my family member went to the restroom and saw the server setting up tables outside and taking orders on other tables.  I do believe that a server should be assigned to the private room to attend to the guests during the dining period, especially when the restaurant has a minimum charge to use the private room.  

Maybe I am expecting too much from the ultimate Burj Al Arab.......","3","2019-10"
"Amazing experience!!","Everything in this Hotel is extraordinary, it’s worth every penny paid, something to remember forever! Valentina, our concierge, was so professional, kind, helpful, friendly and knowledgeable that we’ll always remember her as well.","5","2019-10"
"Special occasion","My husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. We stayed only for 3 nights. Room was huge. Staff friendly...... for a seven star hotel and for that price, it should make a difference. Breakfast very average, nothing special. 
Only once did I mention at the aquarium restaurant that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary and they prepared a surprise  in our room.....the table was full of sweets and roses..very nice and also delicious...thanks for that .... it was wonderful...","5","2019-06"

"Culinary flight experience","Wanted to visit Burj Al Arab for so many years! And since I was in Dubai, decided to do that and to do so called “Culinary flight dinner” . Very expensive but very impressive as well! Must try! We visited four restaurants out of which Al Mahara is amazing for food as well as setup with giant aquarium! We thought that it will be just small plates but actually our 7 course meal paired with wine was A LOT! Price around 900 euros for two 🥂","5","2019-10"
"Fabulous Staff","We didn't stay in the hotel but booked in for drinks whilst on honeymoon. Staff were so attentive and when Kush heard it was our honeymoon he arranged a small celebration cake and a rose for us. It was a lovely gesture and made our visit to the hotel so memorable","5","2019-10"
"Mr. Barry Orton","Immediately amazed by our suite 1406 on arrival. Staff were generally  welcoming and informative. We booked  the Arabic food restaurant which was also  of the highest  quality as was it's  staff. BUT ! As it was my 75th birthday we thought  a pre-dinner  drink in the Skyiew Bar would be a nice touch. We warmly welcomed by the personnel at it's  reception who introduced us to the bar staff. That is when things went downhill. We were shown to our seats with our backs  to the windows. We had an unrivalled view of the padded high backed bench seat opposite and the tkut of the bar from which we were served two  minuscule glasses of mediocre rose wine at extortionate prices. Having noted  that there a number of free tables for two by the windows with a "" sky view"" I politely  asked if we could move to them - even temporarily to finish our wine but I was curtly informed  the we needed to book  to expect to actually see out.So we sat and enjoyed the uninterrupted view of the rows of inlaid tables as shown  in the attached image which was more like you would expect at a poorly managed  Premier Inn at closing time. Then to top it all my wife lost her pearl bracelet , which we reported to security but hitherto has not been returned. Overall we regret transferring that day  from The Dar Al Mastyf which had been wonderful. Just thought I should  share  our dissappointment.","3","2019-10"

"A magnificent evening ","From the moment we arrived at this 7* hotel, we were treated like royalty. The entrance, was just stunning. So beautiful.
We were greeted upon our arrival, and taken up to the bar. We were immediately taken to our table and I have to say, the staff were so professional, courteous, friendly and warm. We ordered our drinks and were given nuts and olives which were delicious. We wanted a table by the window but unfortunately there weren’t any available. However, we were told that as soon as one was available we would be seated there. Luckily, we were moved to a window table and I have to say that we had the most amazing time and experience ever. Although, the booking time was for 2 hours, at no point were we rushed. We were made to feel comfortable and relaxed. 
After, the bar, we took lots of photos and were just treated with the utmost respect. I would highly recommend a visit here. It is definitely worth the experience. 
Thank you to all the staff who made our day so memorable and special.","5","2019-10"
"Meh...","I was really looking forward to this hotel but left feeling very disappointed. Room was a let down with a refurb badly needed. The overall experience felt like a large cruise ship and very noisy. Loads of kids screaming around every where I went. Would have loved a nice quite area.","3","2019-10"
"Worth every penny!","The service was excellent. From coming in through the gate to the welcome committee to the butler to the check out was unbelievable. They did everything in their power to make this one of the best hotels i've stayed in, better than Atlantis the palm, better than Emirates palace. 

the room was a 2 floor, i was blown away by the massive amount of space, The Technology is a little outdated, but bearable. the internet on floor 16 was sluggish. The amenities and supplies were great. The pool in the back is breath taking. 

Best thing here : service. 10/10 nothing can compare.
Least liked: technology. internet slow, feels like TV has a timer that will shut off.","5","2019-10"

"LUXURY 7 STAR & ROLLS ROYCE SERVICE","Great hotel & staff generally,  Breakfast was the weak point frankly  🇬🇧 !!  We our English & live a British Breakfast including Pork Sausage & Pork Bacon,  it was no issue at the Jumeirah Beach hotel across the way,  but a big fuss was made when we requested it to our embarrassment.
We spoke to the New Michelin Chiefs & they got the products from the hotel across no issue, the breakfast is not really for residents of the hotel like us, it's full of orientials chinese or japanese taking pictures everywhere & they pay like £100 for breakfast only to visit the inside of the hotel, for a 7 STAR hotel we really dont want invasive people, it was like a ZOO HOTEL & the totled, Rich & Famous was fair game to be photographed eating breakfast or at any other time,  I noticed security did not control the ZOO VISITORS!!  paying a fee to visit the hotel for about £100 each,  When you pay the room rate we pay we dont want nor expect this!!  I stay in luxury hotels all over the world & the Burj Al Arab is like s Tourist Zoo with Coach loads of people pushing & going where they are not ment to even getting in private lifts,  lucky they did not have a special lift security access but they tried!!  All to take pictures especially the Chinese that our rude.

The private Club & Infinity pool is nice but again the coach partys even thought theirs clear signs saying Residents Only Keeped going in invasively.  We had a Cabana & again the keeped looking in & sitting on our private cabana chairs!!! 🤔  Security final got ride of them about 11am I guess after the coach loads left.
The standards have dropped sadly.
I wanted Al Ain Camel Milk to be told that it was not available, I spoke to Executive Chef Moon & it was made available immediately ice cold & free.
The Michelin Chefs our so much better than before especially the French Chinese Chef & Chief Moon, Dinners & Lunch was a Delight & highlight of the stay.
 For $2,000 dollars a night I'd book elsewhere to be honest if you want quality & peace privacy & quiet.
Further a Rude junior staff member shouted me from the middle of the Infinity pool with friends & my wife for having a mesh net float as I cannot swim, again further embarrassment caused by poorly trained staff,  a senior staff manager pulled him up & said it was allowed for me & I'd asked permission, He apparently was from the water park & a junior manager I learnt later & should not have even been in the Burj  Al Arab Private Pool Area & was pulled in becuse they were short staffed which was apparent along if staff were not trained well or experienced.
The best part was the somewhat tired looking 2 storey Suite, our room was near the very top of the hotel,  we noticed how dirty the windows were,  it was blamed on the building work & brick dust,  which was all over the hotel, we noticed rust about the hotel outside & through our wrap around windows, maintenance was very lacking.
The Butlers had to constantly be asked to do things including unpacking our cases, which they did not do for hours & nothing was ironed.  The butlers mostly constantly had their hands out for tips, one even said he preferred Pounds £ another Dollars $.

We had booked to stay again in a few weeks again but I cancelled it as for 8 nights or $16,000 it's seriously not worth it,  the Hermes Products my wife & others noticed was rationed carefully !!  No oils this time for the baths or special salts.
The Assistant Transport Manager cocked up some times we required the Rolls Royce, 1 a Charity Event & Another visiting a Cat Rescue,  no Car was ready even though we reminded the butlers which changed like the wind.  We enjoyed our journey to the airport in the Rolls,  they our like the hotel showing signs of wear & look old with 140,000 on the clock, that's alot of miles!  Driver was nice & helpful.
Best bits Chef Moon & other 2 & 3 Star Michelin Chefs in the evening & meeting Justin Bieber who was really nice,  he was doing his World Tour at the time & had a Yellow Lamborghini Aventador Convertible, chilled fella in T-Shirt & Shorts was maybe midnight, Rolls Royce back to the airport  15 minutes & BRITISH AIRWAYS FIRST CLASS HOME.
We recommend a new hotel on the Palm called the Emerald Palace run by Margaret Paul the old BURJ AL ARAB hotel Manager, we stayed 8 nights in a beautiful new multiple room suite, service great, food good, 5 Star but I'd say better than the Burj Al Arab   SORRY!!!  Stay at the Emerald Palace Kempinski on the Palm Dubai,  much better service &  (NO)  BUS LOADS of Oriental breakfast visitors coming to take pictures & annoy hotel residents like the Burj Al Arab!!  I'd say these day the charges our silly & its 4 star.","5","2019-06"
"A 8/10 for a unique experience","The staff is very friendly, an excellent welcome, really good food and a beautiful hotel. The room is breathtaking.

"One Word....LUXURY","We went there for my birthday ! This hotel is totally worth all the hype and price...The rooms are to die for; the restaurants' food is amazing (esp Al Iwan....Arabic buffet ) is awesome; literally every dish was delicious. The rooms were of course expensive, but surprisingly restaurants and Spa were not really as expensive as some of the other places in Dubai can be. The decor of the hotel lobby is a bit too loud for my personal taste, but then it;s Burj...It has to be a bit Over the top ! The only negative for me was, it was so good my husband and son only wanted to stay at the hotel for the whole week, and didn't want to step out of the hotel to see rest of the Dubai :(","5","2019-08"
"Luxury cabana","While in dubai we wanted to see what the burj was like so we decided to book a luxury cabana day. While a little expensive it was worth every penny. The only issue we had was the buttler service button didnt work, i mentioned it to one of the staff and they tried but failed to get it working aswell. There was no mention of trying to fix it or any solution so we had to go and get out own food and drinks when we wanted them. (Sounds bad that im moaning about that but its all in with the price i would expect something to be done about it in a 7 star hotel). All in all it was amazing day and we would deffo go back an do it again next time im in dubai.","5","2019-10"
"Visit to Dubai","This hotel encompasses the ultimate luxury in every aspect of your stay. Hotel rooms are all suites and are beyond beautiful. Staff are well trained to respect and help in every way. Standard of food in restaurant ultra high. Obviously the only one thing which might be negative to some travellers is the prices of hotel, food and beverages. It is not for the fainthearted. We had three nights on 40% off but still expensive although its worth every penny if you can afford it.","5","2019-09"
"Slightly Disappointed by drop in standards","Having stayed at the Burj Al Arab several times in the past, we booked again to stay 6 nights in Sept 2019. I requested a high floor room which we have always in the past, I also informed the hotel of our arrival time. 
 
On arrival we greeted with the usual wow factor, we were told our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a sky view room? We were taken to the 15th floor out of 24 and shown to our suite where we went through the private check in. Once everything was completed, we were left in the suite we looked around the suite we both looked at each other and said looks like there is something missing. I said because we were early, they may not have had time to set the suite up.  
We spent the afternoon on the Terrace where the staff (Abbs) were excellent as normal. We talked about what we thought was missing, Welcome letter, fruit in the fruit bowl, flowers in the room and the lack of Hermes products in the Bathroom. We enquired about the missing item to be told that the hotel had ended their contract with Hermes, even though it still said they provide them on the web site. The web site also says they provide 24/7 which we found during our stay wasn’t the case. We were given the Butlers contact number and told if we need anything at all we could “What's app” them and they will sort it out for us. 
 
We encountered problems with this system a couple of times during our stay, one trying to book a car back to the hotel after a night out and another one trying to get a bucket of ice to the suite which we gave up on after 45 mins. We informed Sophie Hohn the Guest Relations Manager who apologised on behalf of the hotel. I told Sophie this is the first time I had the use my room card to get into the suite, I also said I have never not seen a butler on the floor has much as this stay. I also told how well the terrace staff (Samy) looked after us, even to be given a welcome letter with fruit every day next to the pool. On a previous stay we were lucky enough to have been shown around the Presidential suite, which I asked if someone was due to stay there because of the amount of flowers and fresh fruit in the suite, to be told “ no sir the hotel just has high standards” which I think now have been lowered.  
We talked about extending our stay by three days in Dubai, and informed the hotel of our intentions, I also said we might try elsewhere, which I then was given the cost for the additional nights. I told them I could stay at “the One and Only the Palm” for slightly more money and at no point did they try to persuade us to stay with them, so after 6 nights we left (slightly disappointed) in a complementary driven Rolls Royce Phantom,   

Once home we received an email telling me if we do wish to go back in the future to contact Sophie Hohn and she would arrange the booking, but I think after staying in another very well know Hotel (which I we write a separate review) we will be using them more often in the future.","4","2019-09"
"Simply the Best!","I travelled to some awesome places and stayed in expensive hotels, but this they all pale in comparison to this place! From the moment you step in, get greeted and taken to your 2 story room, to the butler, delicious restaurants, and overall amazing amenities, you can’t do better than this hotel. If you choose to stay at another hotel like I did, make sure the Burj Al Arab is your last stop. No other hotel can stand up to this one!","5","2019-10"
"Wow! Luxury Cabana / Terrace day visit ","We didn’t stay here but was in Dubai on holiday and I had pre booked a day in luxury cabana with use of the terrace & infinity pool for a belated birthday treat for my husband. 
Most expensive ‘pool day’ ever but worth every single penny / dirham! From the moment we arrived every member of staff in the hotel to the poolside was so happy and attentive to us and the day really was a once in a lifetime experience which we will never forget! 
We were escorted to our luxury cabana, air conditioned coolness which was just lovely as temperature still 40 degree plus outside! To my delight the table in cabana had been pre decorated with ‘happy birthday’ for my husband. We had the most amazing fruit platter delivered, enjoyed soft drinks from the mini bar and used our ‘butler calling service’ for tea and coffee and lunch from Scape poolside restaurant - which was one of the nicest meals we have ever had it was just delicious! 
The luxury terrace is outstanding, peaceful, quiet, and the infinity pool with built in jacuzzi areas with view out to sea and to The Palm was just amazing. The pools were lovely and quiet, and we spent so much quality time together just being in the pool enjoying the view - for that alone the day was worth it! 
We were also surprised by staff prior to the end of our day with birthday cake for my husband and happy birthday sung to him...and I was given a rose which was a lovely touch! 
For a 7 star hotel, one would expect a high level of service and customer care - we could never afford to stay here but doing this let us experience this amazing hotel, have a look round, take photos and have the most special day round the pool...would recommend to anyone who wants an extra special treat but isn’t staying on holiday here.
Also lunch allowance is included in the day and we had a main and desert each within this...so additional cost would only be alcohol as soft drinks tea & coffee are included. 
Thankyou to all staff who made our day amazing on the 16/09/19 Mr and Mrs Rowe 😊","5","2019-09"
"Amazing","It is 7 star⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ because it the most attention I ever had , the food was awesome!!! All the staff was courteous. Excellent swimming pools. They have woman’s pool and unisex swimming  pool. The architecture it was admirable to my eyes.","5","2019-09"

"Amazing stay","Celebrated our one year anniversary at the Burj Al Arab and it was the best experience we’ve ever had. Treated like royalty from our ride in a Rolls Royce to being greeted by staff and escorted to our room. Gorgeous hotel, room and service. We will be back!","5","2019-08"
"The Crown of Dubai","Burj Al Arab is like another world. We have never seen before. It was so amazing and crazy. Thanks for the perfect service. We enjoyed dinner and breakfast soooo much! The pool area and the pool boys were dreamlike!!! ","5","2019-09"
"Dubai","Done a trip to this hotel and was breathtaking the views from the observation floor are amazing  , the entrance with the water future is beautiful with a huge built in aquarium as you go up the escalator to the lifts well worth a visit","5","2018-11"
"The best hotel in the world!!!","This is really the best hotel in the world, we stay for one night and it was the best of our trip to DUBAI, this is really a seven star hotel, all the personal makes you feel like a king, I will come back as soon as I can.","5","2019-09"
"Wow","We only went for a little look and you can’t get too close to it but what a building this is. We went there by taxi and just stood and admired the thing. Well done UAE top stuff and well worth a visit","5","2019-10"
"As good as it gets!!!","From the moment that we arrived at the Burj, the welcome, ongoing service, food, ambience, everything was just perfect. The staff were so friendly and could not do enough to help. The room was absolutely fantastic, best we have ever had, and we have stayed in some fantastic hotels around the world. Great views from your room too.
We will definitely be coming back to stay here. Perfection!","5","2019-09"
"Real Luxury","From the moment you pass the security untill you pass them again on the way out it is an exceptional service and treat. All contact with staff is personal and a specific person attends only to you. Check inn runs exceptional smooth. Room is the best. The best sleeping experience we had in any hotel. Rooms are totally isolated and cant hear any noise from outside. All the staff are extremely friendly and helpfull. Food and facilities are excellent. A must visit","5","2019-09"
"Old rooms, terrible room service , no privacy ","This hotel has no privacy for its guests.
All day long there are tourist groups in the hotel taking photos everywhere. Hotel guests are being photographed or filmed involuntarily!
We put “Do not disturb” sign on our door - which is a big red light “DND”. Staff does not care: they knock loudly the door, they call in the room, they do not give a s... if you want privacy.

On top of that: the rooms do have indeed a nice view but they are old, their pipes and sewage needs refurbishing! We asked several times engineers to come and fix the shower , the doors, the noises, the bad acoustics - but they failed with most. 

Room service - a disaster! I ordered a simple thing for breakfast: some blueberries, watermelon and green tea. AFTER AN HOUR only, the butler - Kristina - comes with the green tea only. No blueberries. I asked: are you cooking the blueberries? It’s been an hour and you did not even inform me why so late. She immediately blamed the other staff and hotel that they do not have fruit, that they needed to go find some.
Burj al Arab does not have some simple fruit?! 

We also booked a pick up service from the airport. Nobody showed up, we waited for 30 minutes! We called the hotel 3 times. No solution. We had to take a regular taxi. Shame on the concierge service of Burj al Arab!...  

Food is good. To give them some credit ( hence the 2 stars).
Pool service is very slow, however the salads served here are nice.

All in all, I would not recommend this place for guests who want modern rooms, privacy and an excellent service. 
I would say this is a 4 star hotel, not a pretended “7 star”. Nonsense. ","2","2019-09"
"Beyond expectations","Bought a package for cocktails at this iconic building and didn’t know what to expect.  Dressed up to the nines and went with great excitement.  I wasn’t disappointed.  Stunning hotel, fantastic staff, delicious cocktails and wonderful night views of Dubai.  Worth every penny.  Staff treated me as an honoured guest.  Will absolutely go again.  When the Lottery fairies cough up I am having a suite here for a month. Xx","5","2019-09"
"Memorable stay","Polished facility & service, absolutely measure up to a 7-star reputation. Staff & everyone works in different areas all very courteous & friendly, go out of their way to assist & make sure you request is fulfilled. Attentive & personable. Enjoy its peaceful yet lively cheerful atmosphere, without families with kids running around loudly.  I wish the sight seeing tour groups to the hotel would only be limited to certain days or time of the week & month. That kind of distort the sense & impression of the hotel especially if you’re first checking in & see those big tour buses outside the main entrance. ","5","2019-09"
"Oh. My. God.","Amazing!! First and probably last time in a seven star hotel!
Only went for a sundowners cocktail (which cost a fortune) but my girlfriend and I were blown away with the beauty and elegance of the building, views and professionalism of the staff.
You simply have to do it. End of.
Oh, and the cocktails were awesome!!","5","2019-09"
"Burj al Arab - Recent Stay","My son and I recently enjoyed our stay at the Burj al Arab.  We were made to feel welcome upon arrival and throughout our stay.  We were attentively taken care of during our stay.  We had time for a spa visit and I would recommend a visit to the spa.  Staff is friendly and well trained.","5","2019-09"

"7 Star Burj Al Arab","No wonder it's world's most luxurious hotel in the world. Smooth check in in our suite. All suites are two floors. Lower floor is only sitting and dining and top floor is the bedroom with a huge bathroom with gigantic jacuzzi. Full size  Hermès amenities. Remote curtains. In suite breakfast. Airport drop off in a Rolls Royce. ","5","2019-09"
"A dream...","The best hotel, we have ever been and the suites  are unbelieveable. fantastic...a dream ...great. We live the infinitypool and the fantastic Service there. The staff at the hotel was attantively Bit unoptrusive","5","2019-09"
"Always excellent","I've stayed here quite a few times it is always consistently excellent in all areas. 
The other good hotels in Dubai just don't compare. At the higher end the cheapest room here is larger and better than all but the most expensive at other hotels. The staff also have a much better attention to detail and the small gifts always provided are great.
Its expensive but that means you get peace both round the pool and in the rooms which are so quiet they are almost church like as you will never hear another guest. The aircon is also the best i have come across almost silent and very consistent so it never gets hot or cold but just stay at the exact temperature set. 
I only really come back to Dubai to stay here, it truly is one of the best hotels in the world. ","5","2019-09"
"Absolutely out of this world.......","We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Burj to celebrate my 50th Birthday. We have been coming to Dubai for 14 years and have stayed in all the Jumeriah Hotels but this was always the dream for a special occasion. 
Check in was seamless, our suite was just amazing. It was HUGE and the views from the ceiling to floor windows are spectacular. To watch the sun set right in front of your window was just superb. 
Our butler was just outside the door but if he/she wasn't around, I used the WhatsApp chat to contact them and they always responded immediately. We did have a very annoying noise coming through the speaker every night in our room but it always stopped at 10.30 so we had no idea what this was not did the butler but it didn't cause too much of a problem. My husband arranged roses and a cake as surprise for me and this was laid out beautifully with rose petals sprinkled beside it. The team had also written a beautiful card wishing me a lovely Birthday so it made it all so special. 
Also, each restaurant we ate in during our stay also presented me with Birthday cake and a rose so I felt thoroughly spoiled. 
I would also like to mention Miguel Rixos, our lovely butler who was kind enough to give us a tour of the upper floors including the Presidential Suite so we could take in the views during the day. Nothing was too much trouble for him. The Hotel also packaged up my flowers so beautifully so I could take them home and they gave me many extra roses which was a fantastic surprise when I opened them. 
The new look pool and terrace were wonderful. Such comfortable sunbeds with thick cushions. The pool staff are so attentive bringing water etc immediately. We also were given ice lollies to cool us down. The swim up bar is a lovely touch and the infinity pool just beautiful. Again to watch the sunset whilst in the infinity pool was so special.
The Hotel even brought in a camel for its guest to ride. My husband and I took full advantage and had a brilliant camel ride around the Hotel. This was a most welcome and unexpected treat. 
The spa area up on one of the top floors is breathtaking - so peaceful. I didn't have a chance to have a treatment but I will make sure I do so next time. 
We used the buggy service to take us over the the bars/restaurants at Madinat Jumeriah and JMB and the drivers were always so accommodating with stopping to ensure I could get the best photos of the Burj in its majestic glory. 
So, having saved the best  til last, I can honestly say I never want to stay anywhere else when we come back to Dubai. It was everything I thought it would be and more. The staff are an absolute credit to the Hotel. Thank you for making my special Birthday so incredibly amazing. Can't wait to visit again.","5","2019-09"
"Magical","I have just returned from the Burj Al Arab after a four night stay with my husband.

This was our fourth visit to the hotel which is a definite favorite of ours.  The service as always was impeccable and it was especially lovely to be recognised by some staff members - in particular the men on the door and our lovely driver Ashock who drove us around this time and the time before.  Thank you so much to him for driving us home in the Rolls Royce on our last evening.  It was a special, kind gesture and we were both touched.

Having watched the new pool section be added and having experienced the hotel before and after, I can say that this is a very good addition to the hotel and was much needed.

I did notice some changes however that would seem to suggest cutbacks.  The nightly gifts have stopped and we just received a chocolate on our pillow each night.  I enjoyed the items you used to get - lip balms, pillow sprays, nail files etc.  Also, the Hermes perfumes and aftershaves are no longer provided which we had been expecting having been to the hotel three times before.  We didn’t bring any with us so had to go without. The house keeping staff always used to replenish the toiletries as well but when I finished my conditioner I didn’t get given any more which also caused a bit of a problem as I had been expecting the same level of provisions as there had always been.

The concierge have also been scaled back.  They used to be on each floor 24 hours a day but this time there was no one there after 8.00pm and you had to call them on Whattsapp if you needed anything.

It seemed a little sad to witness what appears to be cutbacks as ‘The Burj’ has always been such a magical place for us.  I know it sounds like first world problems but when you have experienced something and then it is taken away you are left feeling a little cheated.

I would also just add that as fourth time returning guests I did wonder if our room might have been upgraded at a time when the hotel was apparently, only 80% occupied, but, sadly it was not.  There was no recognition at all of the fact that we were regular guests, not even a bottle of wine, which was a shame.

We will be back in Dubai next May/June and whilst we really did have an amazing time, it might now be time to try somewhere else.","5","2019-09"
"Hotel Review","The heating of water for shower is difficult to control and always too hot. 
The speed of some service is too slow, especially for two cases, we request for bottle opener, but no one provide to us finally and the scanning for passport takes around 1 hours, which made our upcoming schedule delayed. 
Overall, the hotel is quite good and restaurant is quite amazing. But would be great if service quality could be enhanced to satisfy 7-star hotel standards. Moreover, if the hotel could provide postal card buy and post service. ","4","2019-09"
"Luxurious Hotel But Service Much Below Expectations","Undoubtedly,  this is a world class luxurious hotel on its design and facilities. Many excellent comments on the service of the hotel could be found in the TripAdvisor but I am not with them. The hotel staff comprised both the new, young trainees from Switzerland Hotel Management, and the old staff who were just like a robot  . They appeared to be polite but I didn't feel they were helpful and their warw service. Having said that, I must be fair to the staff of the Spa and Health Centre. They were really nice ! Afterall, I am a bit disappointed with the overall service in such a world class hotel.","2","2019-09"
"A perfect week in the Burj Al Arab","This beautiful hotel is a tourist attraction that highlight a stunning landscape along this coastline. I have just enjoyed a perfect week experiencing the luxury of the hotel. Whilst sitting on its own island it is also  affiliated to the various hotels as part of the Jumeirah group. The courtesy buggy and abra (boat) transport to the local beaches, hotels, souk and Wild Wadi Water Park added to the experience. I would very happily stay at the Burj Al Arab again. ","5","2019-09"
"Amazing","This was the most amazing hotel that i have experienced every person in the world will love it. WE will definitely be back for sure. The atmosphere the security the ambiance need i say more.. the butler service and the whatsap 24 hour availability is truly outstanding.  ","5","2019-09"
"Good Experience ","One of the best hotels in the world they have such a great service they know about hospitality business with vip , we spent 5 days every single day our butler was there 100% our floor was great just vip people private and security amazing , congrats management .","5","2019-08"
"The Burj Al Arab is the best!!","They made me feel like a princess.  They gave attention to every detail...including my bubble bath.  They greeted us like royalty...Rosemary, Issa, and Miguel are the best, and I would definitely stay again!!!","5","2019-09"
"Stay at the Burj","If you are looking for a premium luxury getaway, then there are better ways to spend your money. The room was very grand and the hotel is striking, beyond that just another 5 star hotel in Dubai.  Lacks that personal and attentive touch, you have to chase and wait. When you are spending so much and you have received better service elsewhere it’s a little disappointing. Also, the hotel overlooks large building works behind the Jumeirah Beach Hotel which has civil works ongoing, so you are woken at 7am to piling works. ","4","2019-09"
"So Much Fun with Friends at Burj al Arab","We stayed at Burj all Arab 
For 4 nights 
We came here to surprise some friends for their wedding anniversary and it was amazing 
We just had such a memorable holiday here 
We had the best time in the Beautiful infinity pool and made the most of our days here 
The suites are so spacious and the views are just amazing 
I was so happy to meet Tobin in the HK department 
I knew him from another hotel in the past so I was really very happy to see him here 
Tobin really looked after us in our suite he could not do enough to make sure we were happy at the Burj al Arab 
Thank-you Tobin 
We really enjoyed every moment at this fantastic  hotel

Our memories will last forever","5","2019-09"
"A Memorable stay in a Stunning Hotel","Arrived at the hotel to a very warm welcome and were given a room on one of the higher floors over looking the Palm and Ferris wheel which was great as the view from the other side of the hotel would have been partially of a building site which was at the old harbour of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel.  On the first night a boat moored up on our side of the hotel and a little later started a firework display which was very impressive and felt like it was just for us. Having stayed at the Burj on a previous 2 occasions this was our best stay yet.","4","2019-08"
"Two bedroom suite","Third visit but our first in the two bedroom suite. Ideal for a family of four celebrating a 50th birthday.
Our visit was mostly superb but we did notice a few cutbacks and niggles here and there which is the first time that’s happened. Issues were brought to the attention of the guest relations manager who was keen to listen.
This was my favourite hotel amongst our extensive travels. It probably still is but has maybe slipped down a little in my estimations. We will return within the year and hope that this visit was just a blip.","5","2019-08"
"Best Birthday Experience Ever! ","Burj al Arab is a paradise. From the rooms to the restaurants, the pool, everything about this hotel is one of a kind. Gold on 27 is my favorite hanging out destination, the interiors are electrifying. The pool is not to miss out for! The staff is highly qualified and extremely helpful and well mannered. This hotel is crafted for people with a rich taste. If you’re in Dubai, you must visit the Burj al Arab. Thank you for such amazing hospitality every time I visit. ","5","2018-10"
"Seven star hotel with ten star service and worth every penny","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab on back to back weekends. First trip we stayed in a sky one bedroom suite, the second time in a panoramic one bedroom suite. Our sky one bedroom suite is on the 15th floor overlooking Dubai city skyline, and our panoramic one bedroom suite is on the 6th floor with a breath taking view of the beach and several nearby Jumeirah properties.  The panoramic suite has floor to ceiling windows that are over 20 feet high in some areas.  The bedrooms of both suites are on the second floor, the sky one bedroom suite's bedroom is a little more private with its own door, whereas the bedroom of the panoramic one bedroom suite is not fully enclosed to provide a panoramic view.  

The hotel has two outdoor pools with lounge areas and two indoor pools on the 18th floor (part of Talise Spa).  The pools are often visited by people taking photos so I recommend coming in the morning when the crowd is thin.  Talise Spa is located on the 18th floor and has a fitness center, sauna rooms, steam rooms, and the two aforementioned pools.  We had couples massage on two occasions and enjoyed the fitness facility. 

The Burj Al Arab has multiple restaurants for fine dining, one of the restaurants is on the top floor and offers afternoon tea for those who want to visit the hotel without staying overnight. However, we found in room dining to be more enjoyable, especially in the comfort of our panoramic suite.  The in room dining selection is diverse, and the quality is on par with fine dining restaurant establishments.  

What sets Burj Al Arab from the other five star hotels I have stayed at is the service provided the staff who truly go out of their way to make our stay as memorable as possible.  Each floor has its own butler who handled our many requests, including setting up our Jacuzzi, arranging house keeping, booking reservations at restaurants, arranging our transportation, and much more.  The staff do an amazing job catering to the individual needs of each guest. We were provided roses and desert during our first stay to celebrate our anniversary.  Katrina and the south Asian (did not catch her name) butler who helped us during our first stay made our anniversary so memorable we booked a return trip the next week.  They are both detail orientated, and did the little things, like getting up and opening our room door each time we exited the elevator, that set Burj Al Arab apart from the other five star hotels I have stayed at. 

My wife craved some moon cakes during our second stay, our butler, Vir made sure to obtain moon cakes for us.  Vir, your gesture on the last day of my stay is truly touching and exemplifies why the staff of the Burj Al Arab goes beyond expectations to make their guests' stays memorable.  I would book any hotel that has you as a staff, and I hope to see you again next time I return to the Burj Al Arab. ","5","2019-09"
"AS Expected","Everything and more than you could ask for in a hotel from being picked up at airport until driven back to Airport all the 7 star treatment that one would expect from a hotel with the reputation on Buri Al Arab should be on your bucket list.","5","2019-09"
"Iconic place to stay","Just stayed for 5 nights - stayed numerous times before and one of our favourite hotels in Dubai 

What makes this hotel even more special now are the beautiful new pools and sun deck ( although couple of years old now) The pool bar is a lovely addition and spent a few hours there everyday - just to cool off of course🥂

The suites are amazing and beautifully maintained - very clean

Staff all very friendly and helpful 

There was however this time a feeling of cut backs. Since opening one attraction was the toiletries which included full sized aftershave and perfume - none this time and no body lotion either. This is such a shame and sure the hotel will receive many complaints about this. No booked dates or biscuits in the room either. Our friends ( two other rooms) did not receive their canapés or drinks in the evening either. 

It is expensive to stay at this hotel and it’s the little things that normally make the greatest difference - very short sighted of the higher management","4","2019-09"

The food was delicious and exceptional. The decor was a fantasy cruise ship that made you feel like you were in a Dream. The grand lobby with the fire and jumping water, the aquarium and unlimited water park access all made one feel happy and grand.

"Afternoon tea ","My husband surprised me with afternoon tea for my Birthday whilst we were in Dubai for Honeymoon. The Burj Al Arab is a breathtaking building. The views alone from the sky bar are breathtaking and thats before we even started drinking tea or eating. Make sure you go with an empty stomach as the afternoon tea consists of an 8 course menu which will definatly fill you up, and take full advantage of the tea selection. While we were there we must have changed teas about 4 times to get the amazing tastes of whats on offer. The only advice I would get anyone who is thinking of going, is to not necessarily book a sea view table. As sometimes Dubai can have quite dusty air and alot of construction the view doesn't always need to be needed. The staff are more than happy for you to walk around the sky bar once your tea is completed and take full advantage of its 'better' views (which sometimes are cornered off).","5","2019-09"
"Summer Holiday at Burj Al Arab","When outstanding is required in every detail, luxurious hotel matched with warm hospitality, fabulous holiday, can't wait until we return!

"Unforgettable","Have never seen and felt the meaning of hotel and its service until having been to Burj al Arab . The level of luxury was by far unsupersedable. All ""rooms"" were duplex with enough space to entertain guests of 20 . However , One needs to have hotel written permission/invitation in order to enter the complex as a whole . All guests are treated as individual VIPs , checking-in is basically as private individuals . Butlers stationed on every floor to attend to every guest staying on that floor . They really did serve as your butler to say the least .Each of the few restaurants had its own character from submarine-like aquarium to skyhigh magnificient view . Do check whether kids are allowed at certain times cause they appreciate a non-screaming environment for their prestigeous guests . So much to compliment on this hotel that you need to go there to feel . Although the hotel is dated , it still take years or decades for any other luxurois hotels to achieve this level .","5","2019-04"
"An Extreme Stay :)))","My stay was above the expectations where me and my family members all enjoyed every tiny detail of the stay. Receptioning and guided touring inside the hotel was more than amazing and stunning and as expected.","5","2019-08"
"Gold bar.","What a bueatiful bar , never seen anything like it , amazing . The sound quality of the music was wonderful.
We commented on it to the DJ. When we were leaving and he said if we were coming back on another night , we hadn't planned to but he said that if we liked the music that much he would put it on a stick for my husband, so he did go back and sure enough he did that for him, that's service for you . The bar staff were very attentive , it was a lovely experience. Would definitely go again.","5","2018-10"
"Excellent 1 night layover stahy","This was my 3rd stay at the Burj Al Arab.
Only one night stopover one way home from Hong Kong this time.

We were celebrating my fathers 70th Birthday, and the staff made his stay extra special, with a cake, and a song in our suite.

August is 'off-season’ in Dubai (it’s very hot)
Because of this, the area has a lot of construction work going on.
We did have to move rooms because of this, but it was expertly handled by the staff at the hotel, despite being late at night!

The Bab Al Yam restuarant was closed, but breakfast was served at the Jun Sui restauraunt, and was the same fantastic buffet as on previous visits.

We checked out on the morning of the Monday, but our flight home wasn't until 2am the following morning. 
We left our luggage with the butler, and enjoyed the hotel facilities for the day.

I have no doubt I'll visit the Burj Al Arab again for another stay in the future.","5","2019-08"
"Fab family luxuorious hotel","Great place to celebrate a memorable event with the family. Impeccable level of service. Staff were amazing. You feel like royalty in the hotel. Room was spacious and luxurious with great amenities and toiletries","5","2019-08"
"Fantastic Stay at the 7 star Hotel","We couldn't fault the stay at the Burj, an amazing hotel and it certainly lives up to its 7 stars. 
With it being our wedding anniversary , the extra gifts in the room and rose petals in the bathroom and bath made it memorable.
The views and rooms are to die for.
Well worth a trip and I would recommend to anyone, I know it costs more than other places but it is well worth the additional cost.","5","2019-08"
"Wow!","This building is gorgeous and the service is flawless. They earned their “seven star” rating.
We stayed in a group and not one detail was overlooked.  It was nice to be so well taken care of while away from home.","5","2019-02"
"lovely stay","TOO LUXURY made perfectly with care  services and technology internet and TV selection was excellent, kids area and in room amenities was really perfect  however only Chinese food available , other than that NOT","3","2019-08"
"So worth it!","This hotel is a splurge, but so worth it. It really is a level above anything else. We also stayed in a club-level suite at the Waldorf Astoria on the Palm, but it didn't hold a candle to the Burj. We'll go back to the Burj next time.

We stayed for 3 nights and were glad we did. The nightly rate dropped considerably, probably because the bountiful freebies (the Hermes products etc.) only come once, and there's a lot to enjoy.

We reserved a refundable room months in advance then re-booked to a non-refundable one two weeks out, getting breakfast included and a Sky level suite thrown in for the same price.

We also splurged for the Rolls Royce pickup, which made it a full 7-star experience and was very welcome after a 16-hour flight.

I was worried about visiting Dubai in August, but it wasn't that big a deal. They have AC everywhere. On the upside, our room was about 1/4 what it would have cost during the Christmas holidays. ","5","2019-08"
"Nice stay in Dubai","Very kind and warm service. I stay 1 night at 21 floor, the butler's service was very nice.

She gave teddy bear to my daughter, I never forget it.

A little disadvantage was transportation reservation was not easy. I've booked ""Dream Package"" that included complimentary round trip service, so I sent a e-mail several times for making a reservation. 
But the staff transportation said it is not complimentary. The problem has been solved, but I was embarrassed.","5","2019-08"

"Proud of Abu Dhabi.","Built to resemble a billowing sail, the stunning architecture of Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai makes it one of the most photographed in the world. All rooms are luxurious suites spanning two floors with state-of-the art everything and incredible views. And beyond the unique over-the-top amenities like the attached helipad and hovering tennis courts, there is a vast array of futuristic dining and nightlife options. Their guest care is also seriously intensive. Upscale extras include in-suite check-in, 24/7 personal on-call butlers, and a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce fleet, all catering to an extremely well-heeled VIP clientele that often includes royalty.","5","2019-08"
"Fantastic afternoon tea","Had afternoon tea in the Sky bar which was second to none!

"Wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary","Hubby decided to surprise me and kids to a two night stay at this luxurious property and i must say it was truly magical..

The 2 bedroom suite is the largest i have  seen and was donned with grandeur and opulence. i loved every detail of the space. The room supplies and sanitary kits were fabulous. Loved the lavender pillow spray for relaxed and sound sleep and also the amazing cuticle cream for bed time application.. 

Our lovely private butler catered to all our needs with a big smile and kids loved all of the complimentary treats that came our way.

The indoor pool inside Talise spa, is a treat to the eyes with the with the arty indoors, and a luxurious jacuzzi beside it. We spent most of our time here.

The property does live up to the 7 star tag it holds - indeed a true masterpiece and epitome of luxury.","5","2018-10"

But overall, everything was excellent and nice. Almost we loved was about the stuff they were kind, helpful and smile all time. Also, the facilities were nice.  ","5","2019-08"

"Unique property with over the top rooms, great service and amazing views","Spent a few nights here on our way to Africa.  The building itself is quite the sight...it is fairly amazing to see.  The room was over the top...large two story with a winding staircase, living room, bedroom, wardrobe and large bath.  The views from the room were simply outstanding...words cannot describe how amazing it all is!

The room was clean and well laid out and the service was quite outstanding.  From the pool, cabana, front desk, etc....everyone treated us so well!

The conceriege went out of there way helping us make dinner reservations (101 at the One and Only was great), organized a yacht trip around the city and canals, arranged transportation for us...all of this remotely and done exceptionally well!

The lounges on the top floor were very nice, views amazing and the cigar lounge was perfect.  The cabanas were small but comfortable and the service was nice as well.

All in all, the property is quite nice (a tad over the top) and the service was outstanding.  I would certainly recomend the property!","4","2019-08"
"Best Hotel in the World","Spent one week at the Burl Al Arab. It was AMAZING. It really is the most luxurious hotel in the world. The staff were excellent. The food was excellent. The pools on the luxury terrace were very good. The Cabanas are very good. ","5","2019-08"
"Nice room and facility","I like jumeirah's luxurious room and service. everything goes well. staffs are relatively kind. few are unkind. Russian staff and some of staffs who is tired of chinese. i understand that.
but, you need to improve your brakfast. it is like thia's pool villa buffet. taste is so so. small and small kinds of food. i think that taste is like 3 star hotel.
","4","2019-06"
"Fantastic!","On our way back home from the Maldives we planned a stop over for 2 nights at Burj Al Arab. 

From the first moment we arrived at BAA we felt really comfortable because of the warm welcome. We are travelling a lot as a family and we have seen quiet a lot of (famous) hotels (like Kempinski, Four Seasons, etc), but this welcome was extraordinary. 

In this context I would really like to highlight our guest relation manager. Always friendly, always with a smile and always endeavoured to make the best for us. 

We were traveling with 2 kids (7 and 10 years old) and the option with the free entrance to the Wild Wadi waterpark is great. A buggy is bringing you there and picking you up as well (2 minutes drive). Furthermore the outdoor pools at the terrace are amazing. We booked a cabana, I think this was a really good decision with the kids so they can cool down a little bit if it is too hot outside (AC in cabana). 

Try for example the Al Mahara restaurant, excellent service and food to really fair prices. Sky bar is amazing too. 

If you have the chance you should stay a couple of nights there, also with kids, it will be a great time for you and your family. 

Enjoy!","5","2019-08"
"Great Afternoon Tea wonderful experience","We had a fantastic afternoon sea at the Burj Al Arab couldn’t have asked for better service from
Tia and Marienette (not sure if that’s the correct spelling) but she really went out of her way to make our visit extra special. Nothing was too much trouble. Was definitely worth the money and would
go back at a heart beat. Really made us feel
like royalty.","5","2019-08"
"Wedding Anniversary","The best and the most luxurious hotel ive ever visited. We celebrated our Wedding Anniversary and we cudnt ask for anything more. The high protocol standards, the beautiful view from the panoramic suite and a personal 24/7 butler, what more can anyone ask for being spoiled. Extra huge suite with bedroom on mezzanine floor was again one of its kind experiences. Absolutely loved the entire experience.","5","2018-09"

Separate pool for men and women. Women can come into men’s pool strongly advise men NOT to try visiting women pool!

As usual Hermes sponsored spa - from shower gels to aftershaves 

Sauna and steam also available very clean ","5","2019-08"

But what else expect from famous 5* hotel in Dubai? They really doing the great job absolutely professional in everything. ","4","2019-08"
"An Exceptional Experience","Recently returned from a 10 night stay at the Burj al Arab in a panoramic suite. Our expectations were high and we were not disappointed. The hotel is luxurious and spectacular. However, this hotel is rather special because of the level of service, attention to detail and the attitude of the staff. All staff we met were exceptional and we were made to feel at home and relaxed.
The butler service we received was excellent and particular thanks go to Esmat and Vivek. We were spoilt by both. Thanks must also go to all staff at Bab Al Yam where we had excellent breakfasts, Sahn Edgar which served coffee and snacks, Scape and Al Mahara restaurants. In addition we spent many pleasurable hours on the Scape deck. The salt water infinity pool is a must as is the swim-up bar.
We arrived in the hotels Rolls Royce Phantom (we arranged this from the uk) and we were given a complimentary Rolls Royce Phantom at the end of our stay back to the airport. What a treat.
This is an exceptional hotel, yes, it is expensive, but worth it and we would highly recommend it.
We will be back.","5","2019-07"

"Astonishing Presidential Suite!","This had not been my typical Hôtel stay as we were celebrating our Engagement with a strictly-family mini celebration at Burj Al Arab Presidential Suite! I will shed light on the night I spent afterwards! The rooms are beyond describable as well as the food, toilets & technology behind the rooms! However, the best thing I personally liked was the level of service offered by the assigned butler & the huge size of the two-storey-Suite! Will definitely come here again probably for our anniversary or another small celebration! ","5","2019-07"
"Second to none!","Most exclusive hotel ever been ! Great architecture, unbeatable hospitality, best personal guest manager Benson !! and lots more of top level experiences made ! Will definetly come back again ! Thanks a lot !","5","2019-06"
"Seven star facilities and a five star service","I stayed at Burj Al Arab in double suite with my family.
Before I arrive I explained to the reservation team that I was going with my wife, daughter (11 month), mother and mother in law to celebrate my wife and daughters birthday.
They told me that they would make a surprise for them to make our stay memorable.
When we arrived we were greeted by a special member of the team who lead us to our suite to make the check in.
The suite was gorgeous and very spacious.
After unpacking our luggage my mother noticed that all the amenities of the room she was sharing with my mother in law were male. So I cald the butler service, explained what was going on and he told me that someone was going to my suite to solve the problem.
We leave the bedroom to have dinner and when we came back they have only changed the perfum. To resume, I had to call more three times to have a simple thing like that done it right.
The next morning we decided to have breakfast in the room (at Burj Al Arab you my choose to have breakfast in you suite or at the restaurant if no extra cost if you ask the regular’s choices).
For my surprise, the guy who brought the meal show’s me a bill and asked my signature. I couldn’t say anything because all my family was there ready to eat and I wouldn’t make a scene.
My family had a great time, because they didn’t know about this incidents, but I didn’t have.
When I call the butler to make my check out, he asked me I had a great time with them and told him that I didn’t have. He looked surprised and asked me what had happened. I told him the holy story. Immediately he called the customer relationship department and a supervisor came to talk to me. She listened all my complaints asked my telefone number an told me that someone would call me in a few minutes.
I went to Ferrari world for a day trip. When i arrived there another supervisor called offering a dinner to compensate the problems I had, but I told her that had spent almost $ 5,000,00 for two nights to see what is a seven star hotel and a dinner would not compensate that.
Immediately she offered me to get back to hotel to stay another two nights for free so can prove me that they are a seven star hotel.
As I had more two days in Dubai, I accepted.
So when we checked in for this second time all the relationship team was there to greeted us. Our suite was full of amenities like champagne, dates, fruits, etc.
After we celebrate the return for the hotel my mother get to the ladies room and she got a bad surprise, instead of two single beds, they put a couple bed for her and my mother in law. (Nobody checked our previous reservation to see what kind of bed should be in the room). So I called the butler service and they put another bed in the room to fixed.
In the next day when I arrived from after a tour(7pm), the doorman asked if I want him to send my luggage directly to my room and I agreed. I had diner and walk around little bit. When I got in my room (10:30 pm) the luggage wasn’t there. So I have to call the butler to find my bag.
At last I had to print some documents for my flight on the best day but my printer wasn’t working. I called the butler again and he came to my suite to solve the problem, but he couldn’t, so I had to move myself to the butler desk to get my job done on time.
Don’t get me wrong, I had a very good experience at Burj Al Arab. I have pointed the just the bad things for a reason, but every one was very polite, attentive and etc. 
the beach team was perfect.
The food is very good.
But if you ask me if it’s worth staying at Burj Al Arab? I would say yes only if you have plenty of money otherwise I would recommend you staying at Hilton, Hyatt, melia that are very good hotels with a much better price.
If you ask me if I would return to Burj Al Arab? I would probably say no, because for me it’s not worth. If they want to charge that amount of money for a stay, they can’t make any kind of mistake.
If you want to call your self as a seven star hotel, the minimal things must be done wit perfection.","3","2019-07"
"Marvelous","One word: Marvelous!
Suggest to allow check out time at 3 pm
Kids area (Auntie Glory) is an excellent staff
Al Mahara service excellent our family definitely will return and recommend to all our friends who plan to travel to Dubai!","5","2019-07"
"Interesting","Not sure it’s quite worth the cost of the high tea, but we enjoyed it (the extra for the view interesting bc we spent the time watching construction). 
Food was beautiful but perhaps too much sweets for me, the food won and we couldn’t eat it all!!","4","2019-08"
"An unforgettable voyage ","My family visited Dubai as our summer ritual in June. We had never been to the Burj Al Arab and had only seen its famous pictures on the internet, so we decided to try give it a try this time.
We made reservations for the Gold On27 bar for my mom, dad and my sister. We were blown away by the hotel and the view from the top. Only problem is my mom had been feeling sick and nauseated all evening so we couldn’t stay to experience the cocktails. However one thing that marked us was when we were taking photos, my mom asked the female staff whose name we got as Siri, for the restroom. The colleague took her. A few minutes later, we realized my mom had not come back to join us and had to go check on her…only to find my mom throwing up, the staff holding her hand, patting her back and my mom leaning on her for support as she was dizzy. And I can tell you I have never seen a more selfless gesture!!. The staff did not act disgusted and was beyond supportive. When we left the bathroom, a gent in black suit offered  a glass of water to my mom, for which they did not even charge us. This is an experience I have not stopped narrating to my team, as I work in hospitality as well, and would love them to emulate this gesture as it is one true demonstration of hospitality.","5","2019-07"
"stopover in Dubai","A layover in Dubai turned into a 2 day mini-vacation. We decided visiting Dubai for a couple days was a better idea than a 14 hour layover. We picked the Burj Al Arab and are delighted we did so. A beautiful awe-inspiring hotel with impeccable hospitality. Food, service and atmosphere were superior.","5","2019-07"
"One of the best hotels I traveled till yet.","Legendary hotel with the biggest Rolls Royce fleet of the world. The service is included and a beautiful experience.

Thank you so much and the service quality is impeccable.","5","2019-07"
"The Best!","An out of this world experience.... overwhelming in so many ways, and all I can say is our short stay was so memorable - from the food, suite itself and the staff - just wonderful and we'll surely be back for our next special occasion!","5","2019-05"
"Still as good","We hadn’t been to the Burj for a number of years but after heading back from Safari we decided to spend a couple of days to celebrate our son turning 18. We had asked the hotel to do arrange a surprise and Eva arranged a surprise for one evening at short notice. The hotel is still as magnificent as it was when we were there last and now with its own pool complex at the rear.
Whilst some of the carpets now need changing and some TLC is required the hotel still delivers. The only issue is that they have coach load of Chinese tourists who appear to stay a day and use it to take pictures and leave. The assistant was trying to stop some Chinese women from going to the men’s changing room on the 18th floor indoor pool. All is all it’s still one of the best hotels. ","5","2019-07"
"Magnificient","wonderful place to spend with family and also fantastic place to spend in couple...The view is memorable, the atmosphere is most then you ask for, you feel and are taking as royalty. I am lucky to have the opportunity to stay at this magnificent resort.  ","5","2019-07"

We arrived early and our suite ( 1 bedroom standard) was ready.
It was amazing. we had everything we needed. We were given some breakfast which was a nice touch. Check was within minutes and were taken upstairs straight away. No queues or anything.  The terrace is amazing. We spent most of our time there, just relaxing and enjoying the views. 
Our Butler was there sometimes, not as much as we would have liked.

"As AWESOME as one would expect & more!","After a relaxing week in Mauritius we thought we would spend a few nights in Dubai on our way back. Stayed at the Burj Al Arab before and this time was even better. Had the kids with me and I was led to believe that its not really a children friendly hotel. That is INCORRECT. Plenty for the kids to do, kids club, indoor swimming if its too hot, inroom computer for their games and lots more. 

The attention to detail from the bedroom to the bathroom is second to none. Lots of little surprises left at turndown time. 

Food is awesome. The whole ambiance of the place is excellent and most importantly the customer service is FANTASTIC. 

From checkin we met Aya and her colleague Julia who took us to our room and showed us around. Julia was very good with the kids and presented herself very well.
Then we had our butler Milos who was always pleasant and on hand if we needed anything. Aldrin was our evening butler who very kindly remebered it was my wifes birthday and presented us with a beautiful chocolate cake with a bouquet of roses.

Definitely a 7 Star experience from start to finish.

From our hotel, we took a taxicab to the BAA. Without a reservation, one would not be allowed past the security gate and the bridge. The place is dazzling, with the gilded decorations. The fresh floral arrangements in the lobbies are beautiful. Our breakfast was excellent (we ordered different selections to taste as many entrees as we could.) Quite a splurge, but worth it!","5","2018-11"
"gold is eaten","Do not say whether gold is eaten. gold is being renewed in this country. It is served to your cake with golden dust in cafes. the hotel is very nice. Do not stay here for a life in luxury go on vacation immediately. The sky tea at the Skyview bar in the Burj al Arab hotel costs 203 dollar per person","5","2019-04"

The duplex suites are fantastic with everything your heart desires its there. LOVED the 24/7 butler services right outside your door for all your needs    ","5","2019-07"
"World Class","There is some potential for improvement in the ease of the check in process, but other than that the Burj Al Arab is ridiculously perfect. I can not imagine that a hotel room can be any better and staff being more attentive. ","5","2019-07"
"THE BEAUTIFUL 😍😍 AND LOVELY ❣️ HOTEL IN WORLD.","This hotel is really good and most popular in this world . Like Dubai city is beautiful. This 🏨 😍 hotel in big luxury rooms in this Burj AL Arab Jumeirah I love this hotel. I like this hotel .😍😍😘😘😝 Nice and nice 👌 hotel 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌","5","2019-07"
"Pricey but an experience of a lifetime! ","We were lucky enough to stay at the Burj Al Arab for a night in early July. 
We booked a two bedroom suite for a family of three (2 adults & 1 teenager) as part of a holiday to Dubai for ’big’ birthday celebrations. 
From our arrival we were treated like royalty although not in an aggressive or pushy manner as we felt in some other places, the staff were very friendly and I would say adapted well to each customer individually. 
When we were shown the suite we were overwhelmed, it was bigger than our house!! 
We booked one of the luxury cabanas for the day and spent a lovely time using the facilities on the terrace. On arrival the cabana had been decorated with birthday balloons and flowers, at the end of the day we were treated to birthday cakes, flowers and a rendition of happy birthday in 3 languages :-)
Due to the luxury of the suite we decided to have room service in the evening and take advantage of being in such a fabulous place. Again to celebrate we were treated to cake and a gorgeous bouquet of roses which I’m hoping to dry and frame as a memory of a brilliant holiday. 
For our family stopping at the Burj was very extravagant, it is pricey but the experience was most definitely a once in a lifetime event we will always remember x","5","2019-07"
"An amazing evening at the sky view bar","Amazing end to our time in Dubai. The staff made it extra special with their professionalism and enthusiasm to ensure we had a lovely evening. Amazing drinks, food and service. 
Asim served us and was a credit to the Burj al Arab, extensive knowledge of the food, view and history of the bar, he made our evening all the more enjoyable and added personalised touches to end our time in Dubai perfectly. 
Thanks to Asim and The Burj Al Arab for their 7* customer service. We will be back!","5","2019-07"
"AMAZING but not for everyone","The hotel no doubt lives up to its reputation.  We stayed here for our honeymoon and it would probably be considered outside our normal travel budget.  The hotel is beautiful, the rooms, the butler, the checkin - everything was faultless. Potentially the only downside was not necessarily against the hotel but rather would be against choosing this if this is not with your ordinary budget (and it would seem obvious) that everything falls in line with the room price tag.  All the services, the room services, the room deposit assumed a certain level of income so in order to really appreciate all the wonders of this hotel, you probably need to make allowance that your room service or massage may cost far more than your would otherwise pay elsewhere.  If you have the chance, its definitely an experience","5","2018-09"
"Tea for Two & Two for Tea","Well we decided while in Dubai we would treat ourselves to afternoon tea in the Burj Al Arab 7 star hotel. 
You need to book directly with the hotel on their website, the total cost for the afternoon Tea package worked out at €350 euro for 2 people, so was it worth it? 
YES! If just for the views alone! But the bonus was the food and how it was served was amazing.
There is no entry into this hotel without a booking. 
We arrived at 3pm and were shown to the sky view restaurant reception area, we were then called to the Gold Lift  and entered a glass lift with incredible views, I guess for me I just did not comprehend what 27 floors up would look like but when the lift doors opened I was totally overwhelmed with the views and got quite emotional! Mad I know but you had to be there!😂
We were taken to our table which look out over the bay ( ask for window table when booking)
 We received the menu card and a glass of Dom Perignon, the waiter then explained the menu to us and as each course was brought out he went through the plate with us.

We loved every minute we were there, (2 hour sitting) the whole experience was unforgettable, I know the cost might put some off but hey you are in Dubai, live a little! 😜😜😜","5","2019-07"
"Memorable stay","We celebrated our 10th anniversary and once we mentioned that the team provided wonderful surprise for us.....excellent dinner at the seafood restaurant: great atmosphere with acquariums as walls. Remarkable food...also for not fish lovers.very efficient lady at reception of the restaurant.","5","2019-07"
"Nighttime I was always hearing the sound who placed the windows and doors I stayed 3nights(4days)","As above the window and room is not clean. Some of hotel staffs not friendly at all. They have not introduced the systems of hotel and room well .i stay 4days(3nights).only last day I feel better.my home is better.","1","2019-06"
"I had high expectations for the Burj Al Arab and they delivered","I have not stayed at the Burj for a few years but as it was our pearl wedding anniversary I decided to book. The hotel pool area had historically let this great hotel down (The original pool was very small) but two years ago they extended the pool area and it now has the wow factor you would expect from the world's best hotel. Staff were very friendly and food quality was excellent throughout all restaurants and bars. Could not fault the hotel and will certainly return again.    Important Please Note: They are doing a lot of building work around the Burj on the Jumeriah Beach side. This is ongoing building work until the end of EXPO 2020 so be aware a lot of dust and noise during the day and night. (It did not spoil our experience but it could disrupt your vacation as the building work gets more intense closer to the opening of expo2020","5","2019-06"
"The most luxurious hotel in the world, truly lives up to the claim","The Burj Al Arab claims to be the most luxurious hotel in the world and having stayed there, it 100% lives up to the claim.
From the moment I was picked up by the chauffeur to the moment I was dropped off at the airport the level of service, attention to detail and beauty of this hotel was second to none. To even try to compare it to another hotel would be an injustice. The Burj Al Arab is in a league of its own. Once you stay here, you will never be able to vacation any other way again","5","2019-06"
"50th birthday meal","Wow how do I begin to review such a perfect place to celebrate your 50th birthday 
On arrival free courtesy cocktails on the lower deck and an added experience that these cocktails are unique to the Burj .
What a way to reach your table by an outside lift , views were splendid .
Well my expectations were met and so much more everything was perfection from the entrance to departure a place I never wanted to leave !
Thank you to all the waiters and waitresses and management for the amazing table which was the best in the restaurant and food was to die for 
My birthday will be one I will never forget 
Thank you to the Burj I will be back again next year the rose lasted for my whole duration in Dubai x","5","2019-05"
"Exceptional and on a different level","I am sure many people wonder is it really worth it? It 100% is! the hotel is stunning the pool complex and views are beautiful and the service is impeccable. There is a reason it's known as the 7 star hotel and having stayed in hundreds off 5 star hotels over the years yes you can recall some but non will leave a lasting impression with you like the Burj Al Arab.","5","2019-06"
"Luxury , different level of Experience.","Wanted to experience the luxury, located in exceptional area, Hotel ambience is excellent, I fell in love with the architecture of the Hotel, outside and interiors, a true Luxury. Server was not up to the mark, my Mac had issue connecting to the internet, no help from IT/ room butler","4","2019-06"
"Best birthday ever!","50th birthday celebration with my family will always be unforgettable! It was the most luxurious and opulent experience ever!!! The service was impeccable and the amenities were nothing but the BEST!!!","5","2019-06"
"Brunch at Bab al Yam","Came here just to experience the hotel. You can’t visit it without either staying or eating there. Amazing place, incredibly luxurious and very expensive but worth it. 
The hotel is iconic, the foyer lined with gold and aquariums. The brunch in the restaurant was great and the views breathtaking. ","5","2019-07"
"Amazing Experience","Made us feel like VVIPs. Everything from our suite, the restaurants, the butler service, the concierge, etc was top notch. Our suite was on the 24th floor with amazIng city views. The large suite made it feel like a home as opposed  to a hotel room. ","5","2019-06"
"Fantastic Stay","Always love staying at the Burj. The hotel staff goes and above and beyond to provide the very best experience. The outdoor pool and the spectacular view remains my personal favourite. In room dining has a great variety. The lobster thermidor is absolutely divine!","5","2019-06"
"Vacation time ","I don’t know if I can find the words for the amazing experience my husband and I had at the Burj Al Arab hotel.  Our journey began with pick up in the white rolls Royce Phantom driven by Nasir.  Our driver was very kind and courteous and most of all very informative. Upon our ride to the hotel he pointed out many landmarks, and gave us a short tour of the city.  We were greeted in the lobby by Mariam, and we were kindly escorted to our suite by Jay.  This hotel has the most amazing door keepers not only did they greet us at the door but also every time we would leave or return to the hotel we were greeted in the most kind and professional manner.  Keen, Charles and Hardley were our favorites and could do no wrong.  Please give them our kindest regards.  Zapheer one of our Butlers was amazing as was Bobby.  Maureen greeted us each morning with a lovely smile as we enjoyed our breakfast.  I wish that I could remember everybody‘s name and give them a kind thank you but when everyone of your staff is absolutely amazing all I can say is thank you again for everything. My husband and I look forward to our return trip to Dubai and with its return will be another stay at your fabulous hotel.  ","5","2019-06"
"High tea deluxe!","Every time I go to Burj Al Arab for high tea I enjoy it more. The champagne (Louis Roederer) is just the best, and the food is decadent and worth every cent. The view is pretty spectacular too!  The service is excellent from arrival to finish. Smooth, brilliant and an amazing adventure!","5","2019-06"
"Just wonderful","It was again a wonderful expetience. I do recommend the infinity pool! The service is extraordinary!
There are no words to explain the wonderful experience we had at this great hotel. Many thanks to the staff.","5","2019-06"

"Burj Al Arab ","A visit to this magnificent property is a must.... it’s the very 1st Landmark that put the world focus on Dubai. The property sits on its own on a small man made island just of the white sandy Jumeirah Beach.
Shaped like a sail it is a breathtaking sight to behold as the warm blue waters of the Gulf are the backdrop as well as the back of the hotel is facing directly east making sunsets look more beautiful than ever from the terraces or the  Infinity Pool of the property.
A private road bridge takes you up to the front foyer where you are greeted and welcomed by hotel staff and once inside you can enjoy the water feature fountain directly in front of you flanked by Aquariums on both sides and escalators taking you up to the restaurants and ground floor of the Grand Atrium.

Enjoy Afternoon tea at Sahn Eddar or dine in Al-Muntaha,Al-Mahara, Skyview bar or relax at Scape on the terrace.

"Truly Stunning","We booked for Evening Dinner at Junsui Restaurant and we explore this 7 star hotel.  it  truly lives up to it. The whole experience surpass our exceptions.

I have a disability and everyone at the hotel went out there way to help me. Thank you ","5","2019-06"
"Drinks at Gold on 27","We had booked in for drinks at the Skyview and were able to also go into the Gold on 27 Bar. I would have to say that we preferred the Gold on 27 venue as it was a little more hip and happening :) All of the staff from both areas were very friendly and helpful. Great service from all of the staff in the Burj Al Arab.","4","2019-06"
"5  Stars at the most","Hotel restaurants poorly decorated. Tables without properly placed silverware, dishes and glasses. The worst thing was the poor wifi performance within our room - something amazing for a hotel that claims to be a 7 star one. Despite the excellent service of one of our floor's butler (Fadi), the rest of the loor butlers did not seem well prepared and were slow to provide feedback. Room technology clearly dated.","3","2019-06"

"Very friendly, informative and professional staff!","As i was planning my anniversary vacation with my wife, I decided to contact this property as the suitable destination for the occassion. The individual behind the call( Mr. Talib) was composed, friendly, professional and exceeded my expectation to quench the thirst of my many inquiries. The description of the different suites given made me feel more anxious and excited at the same time to book and stay at the hotel despite the price tag. Well done Jumeirah group for the outstanding professionalism. Well done!","5","2019-06"
"The Best of the Best","We have have been very fortunate to travel to many places and stay at many hotels/resorts. It is often difficult to say something is “the best” of a particular category or activity. However, that is not the case with Burg Al Arab.  It clearly stands out as the absolute best hotel at which we have ever stayed....by a significant margin!  From the moment you are greeted in their breathtaking lobby, it is easy to understand why they are the only seven star rated hotel in the world. Every member of their staff pamper you and see that all of your needs and expectations are not only met but exceeded. We cannot say enough about our suite Butler, Derek. He was professional, kind, and felt like family by the end of our stay. He saw to it that we were able to do all of the things we wanted to do as well as provided us access to other activities which we loved and would not have otherwise known about if it was not for him. His professionalism and personality was beyond appreciated. He made our stay extra special and we missed him following our departure. I can go on and on about how wonderful our stay was at Burg Al Arab. Our suite was exceptional. The food that we enjoyed in our room as well as the various restaurants throughout the hotel was absolutely delicious and would satisfy the palate of any foodie. The views of the water as well as the city were unparalleled. The pool deck is extremely unique and was a wonderful area to relax during a portion of our stay. The couples massage that we had in their spa was fantastic. Sometime spa experiences, even at nice resorts can leave you unsatisfied. That was definitely not the case at Burg Al Arab. Their spa and therapists are as good or better than at any spa. Sophie, our Guest Relations Manager, escorted us to our room and provided us with her personal cell phone number to assist us with any of our needs of our current or future stays. We will MOST DEFINITELY be returning!  Our flight on the amazing Emirates Airlines, the hotels and restaurants that we enjoyed while in Dubai and the amazing people of Dubai made this clearly the most wonderful trip of our lives. Everyone at the hotel and throughout Dubai spoke perfect English and we have never felt more safe than we did in Dubai. We have not stopped sharing how wonderful our experience was in Dubai and particularly at the Burg Al Arab and very much look forward to returning several times!  Thank you so much for making our trip there so enjoyable and memorable!","5",
"Burj Al Arab","This hotel is very expensive (due to the poor exchange rate at the moment) but you get what you pay for. Quality and size of our 2 bedroomed suite was out of this world.. Everything about and in this hotel is luxurious. It simply takes your breathe away. The added pool area was very relaxing and not crowded  which I thought it might be. We only stayed here 2 days but the experience and memories will be with us forever. ","5","2019-06"
"Simple. It’s the best ","I was lucky enough to spend two nights with my wife as part of my 50th celebrations   
As you can imagine we had been looking forward to this for some considerable time and I’m glad to say we weren’t disappointed. From the moment we arrived the attentive staff were on hand to see to our every need and remembered our name everywhere we went. The highlight for me was the infinity pool with the private beach nestled beautifully between another pool, the chilled water foot wash’s was a great touch. I can recall my sun bed being changed on three occasions for new towels in one day. And we didn’t even ask. Sorry I forgot that guys name but well done 

This place isn’t cheap, but I guess you don’t come here to save money. But one thing that is good value here is the memories we have. We so many from the sky bar cocktails, Butler service and the afternoon tea. 

The only slightly negative comment we have is the Junsai restaurant closed at 20.30 which was disappointing as we were not told about it at booking. 

That said, our biggest problem now is finding a hotel that meet this hotels standards. Our holidays will never be the same again 

One point for the management to improve on is the website. It does not do your property any justice 

Looking forward to my 100th birthday as this will be the next time I can afford it

Thanks again to all the staff who made this special

Breakfast is amazing with some lovely views too.","5","2019-06"
"Excellent trip ott","Wow! Trip of a lifetime. Excellent hotel and facilities. Thanks so much for the hospitality from the check in to the departure. Celebrated my birthday with wonderful cake. Staff were so professional and friendly - Charles ( from Kenya) at the door. Christopher the butler from Philippines. Went out of his way to make us feel at home. Few minor issues with the suite like tv not working ; Jacuzzi water leakage.all duly fixed in the afternoon. Excellent food and private beach. See you in another few years. Felt slightly out of place being non royalty but such is life ","5","2019-06"
"Unforgettable","Our stay was perfect from beginning to end. Many thanks to the staff and specifically to Anni, which was responsible for the preparations for our wedding at Burj Al Arab. She did an exceptional job!

"Third Time Lucky! This Stay Was Precisely What We Wanted & Expected","We have frequented the BAA twice before and both times our experiences never lived fully up to our expectations.

However, this stay I have to say EXCEEDED all expectations and was perfect from start to finish.

Staff: from arrival and throughout, Daniela (Guest Relations) was an absolute Ambassador for the perfect 'go-to' person; she is a credit to the F & B/Hospitality Industry and co-ordinated so much for us without us actually seeing too much of her. Her influence/planning (from behind the scenes) was second-to-none and she is a major asset to the Hotel.

We could add the Butler Christopher from The Philippines, Butler Tariq and the gentleman that runs the Fitness Centre/Gym as being real stand-out people that were so professional in what they did.

Concierge staff, bell-boys, front of house - all superb and going that extra-mile to ensure your stay was as perfect as it could be. The staff at the swimming pools were also outstanding, remembered your name, preferences and always looked after you.

You have to remember at The Burj al Arab that so many people you encounter in the Lobby or at the Pool, are not guests of the hotel but are paying for a High Tea/Cabana experience, or are visiting for a function. The staff this time, differentiated between the two and as a guest you felt truly special in the level of service afforded and just how nothing at all was too much of an issue.

Pleasing to us this time around was the breakfast set-up and the staff at breakfast; the buffet was good, varied and the Chefs on the egg-station could not only cook precisely what you wanted, but they would personally bring it to your table. In fact the whole breakfast experience was super from start to finish and this is a major improvement from our last visit.

All in all, after two 'so-so' visits previously we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the BAA this time around and really do feel that the Hotel has regained its status as being more than a 'cut-above' other 5-star experiences, it truly is a delightful and relaxing place to stay. 

From arrival to departure, it really did run on rails and we would like to pass on our heartfelt thanks to everyone at the BAA as this time around, we felt like we were getting the level of service/amenities that were advertised/paid for.","5","2019-06"
"AMAZING","Great hotel very clean and layer out nicely. The staff is amazing and truly care for each patron. Every room comes with an amazing butler who will do anything and everything you could possibly need. Would highly recommend the Burj to anyone.","5","2019-06"
""" 30 Times ""","Well before you think we are mega-rich, please note we are working class people who work hard to stay here as much as we have and in our opinion worth every penny :) in 2000 we stayed in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel on our very first time to Dubai and that was amazing and at that time you were allowed access to the Burj and was blown away. We said next time we came back would love to stay here......well once you have stayed here where else do you go....
My husband is rather shy and did not think we would fit in, wrong as we were made to feel very special from that first stay and has now become our second home. There has been a number of changes recently in the hotel, some good and some bad as they have lost a number of staff who we had come to know and became friends. The new management were very keen to hear our views re the changes and listened as we do not want the personal service to change as this is indeed the Burj Al Arab...Our thanks to Wendy Liu and her team for looking after us like Royalty. We had only one thing that bothered us was the very poor internet and had a problem face timing our family, This is the biggest suites in Dubai and if you work out the price per square meter its amazing value. We indeed will be back BAA....","5","2019-05"
"Burj al Arab","Thank you Alla at the kids club for looking after our little son. You were proactive, engaging and hands on. Little Robert enjoyed his time at the kids club. You took a personal interest in him and we were very happy.","5","2019-06"

"Interesting experience but 7 star","Undoubtedly a one-off hotel build but 7 star? No. Try balmoral in edinburgh for service. Too many day trippers and people taking photos. Despite staying i felt like a day tripper. The number of times i was asked for the room number felt intrusive. Its an incredible build and the suite is stunning but i would have expected a few more complimentaries or non chargeables.","4","2019-06"
"Ms","I was very disappointed.
The hotel wss pnot as I expected 7 stars hotel.

Their staff took my passport to check in and said will return to
Me soon, but I waited inside our room around 1 hour still couldn't see anyone brought my passport back until I called them and another 10-15 minutes finally a lady brought my passport to me.

Already a couple of people mentioned before,all the staffs asked tips for their services,no money no services.

The hotel maintained is not good,our spa not works perfectly.

The last, their staffs's training are not good, when they press the room bell to ask house master to open the door, they need to wait until the house master to said ""yes come in"" then come in the room,they can't just simply used their key room to open the door or even didn't knock or press the bell just open the door and shocked to me.","2","2019-05"

"good","everything was perfectly good.
We never forget our short stay with you. Having a battler in each floor is very good idea. Very important was that every staff was following the SOPs for example even if swimming pool was empty the responsible persons were in duty like 10 people are in.","5","2019-06"

"Amazing stay at the Burj","Fantastic hotel, we have been holidaying in Dubai since 2008 and always wanted to stay at the Burj, now achieved that goal and it has exceeded expectation. Immaculate, clean, comfortable. The room is excellent with all needs catered for and the Hermes products a real luxury. The new pool deck is perfect and provides the space needed to feel the atmosphere and luxury of the resort but also enough space to be personal and find your own spot away from crowds.

"Great facilities but poor service of a manager","My friends and I visited Burj Al Arab on May 30-31. I was shocked at the shrewdness and cleverness.

I was visiting our friends in Burj Al Arab; when I entered, no one from the hotel informed me of the time the visitors have to leave; therefore, we were just expecting that an employee would come and alarm the visitors to leave when it's time (since it's the world's best hotel, we were expecting AT LEAST this kind of service). However, no one still came until the morning but instead, they charged us.

It is the hotel's job to inform DIRECTLY TO EVERY VISITOR the time to leave when they are collecting the visitors' ID's, and when it's the time for the visitors to be out, they should have taken an initiative and warned the visitors. Which, I still do not understand why they didn't kindly warn or asked us to leave on time, because then I would've left. Instead, they made money by not informing or warning to the visitors and collecting the extra fee the next morning.

7 stars hotel should have an exceptional service in all areas reflecting their price, marketing, and reputation; Burj Al Arab is not is cheap at all. However, I was extremely disappointed that because of the hotel's carelessness and shrewdness, I had to pay full amount of it, and they are not taking ANY kind of responsibility of not doing their work. 

As I took responsibility (because they never warned us to leave or informed us the time) by paying the full amount, I also expect Burj Al Arab, as 7 stars hotel, to take responsibility of not informing us the time and warning us to leave by apologizing compensating to me.

After this incident, I will not recommend Burj Al Arab to anybody.","1","2019-05"
"A Breakfast Visit","Reluctant to shell out over £1000 to stay the night we decided to go for breakfast. 450AED for 4 of us was not too bad, and we were given the opportunity to have a good look around, go into the terrace etc. The building is superb from inside and once there it is easy to see why they charge so much. Breakfast was continental and as expected but the overall experience was worth the money.","4","2019-04"

My only wish is that we could have stayed another week.","5","2019-02"

Guests may arrive at the property by either one of the world's largest chauffeur-driven fleets of Rolls-Royce's or alternatively by a dedicated helicopter transfer service.

Al Muntaha is the Burj Al Arab's signature fine dining restaurant serving contemporary European cuisine. 

It has a separate indoor infinity pool, hot tub and treatment rooms overlooking the Arabian Gulf complement the spa, along with saunas, steam rooms and plunge pools. 

If you are staying here then the hotel also offers unlimited access to the water sports activities at Wild Wadi Waterpark, located just a 5-minute walk across the island bridge.

Genuinely it was worth the money spent for the exclusive experience.","5","2018-07"
"Best hotel","Thank you for this amazing experience, best i’ve seen in the world.
All the staff was perfect, John the butler in the 14st floor and Clarisse Laiguillon, guest manager who allowed us to have a very good trip in Burj Al Arab.
I recommanded Scape restaurant, food was perfect with a beautiful view, i have to mention too the manager egyptian guy (Shérif ?) who always have smile and good advices.

"Seventh Heaven","Amazing 10 days yet again. New management and all the staff, butlers, restaurant staff, pool guys made our seventh visit the best yet. Our 30th trip to Jumeirah properties everything was outstanding. The personal service, the attention to detail, the food, the deck, the Spa team,  fabulous. The Burj in our opinion can not be surpassed and we are already planning our return. Special mention to Simona Battista, Guest relations manager, Issa, Raymond we can not thank you enough for helping us enjoy our time with you, for making loyalty count and we look forward to seeing you when we next visit.","5","2019-05"
"Now we saw how the other half lives:)))","Our experience here was fabulous and it is that of a regular European family being inside an impressive and breathtaking location; you can hardly believe that you are actually inside, in this hotel that you have only seen featured in movies and on TV as a place for the rich and the famous. Obviously, in order to get in (because we were staying at Sofitel Dubai, so sadly but understandably, not here) we had to make an on-line fully paid reservation (almost 8 weeks ahead) which only gave us access to ground floor and the lounge on the first floor. They only allow you to get near (not to mention inside) the hotel if you can present your reservation, otherwise you are good to go...back where you came from. So, needless to say this is indeed a high-end, expensive, full of rich and famous people location, so if you want to get inside, you need to spend the big bucks, but every penny you spend here will get you awesome memories to last you a last time. At the entrance there are valets, inside the service personnel is extremely professional and overly kind, we had gold-leaf coffee (yap!), main course, sweets and gin. The vibe you get is that of a movie star:))) That night we saw an African-famous family shooting a reality show. There was a quartet singing and a piano player providing exquisite atmosphere for the guests. When we left, the valet actually called us a Lexus cab, opened our door for us to get in and...off we went sighing. So, basically, to sum up our 3-hour evening here: we saw how the other half lives, which I totally recommend everyone to try:)))","5","2018-06"
"Most amazing hotel to stay in","I stayed here with my family for my birthday and the service, amenities, staff and hotel room were impeccable. A must do experience once in your life. I was given French champagne, balloons and cake for my birthday which was an extra special gift from the staff. ","5","2019-05"
"Wow","We stayed for my Husbands 50th birthday and didn't know what to expect.  We thought it  may be a bit over the top for us but wanted to experience it for a special occasion.  The hotel arranged for us to be collected from the Airport in a Rolls Royce and on arrival was escorted straight up to our room, which the hotel had upgraded to a panoramic suite.  The view and the size of the room was breathtaking.  They had also arranged a surprise in one of the cabanas which was decorated with balloons, along with wine and a chocolate cake.  The deck area around the pool is stunning and although we have visited Dubai many times the views of the hotel from the pool is unbelievable.  It was also so lovely to sit outside on the deck area and eat the delicious breakfast, the setting was so good we didn't want to leave to go and sit round the pool!!  The service was fantastic throughout the hotel and you were made to feel very welcome and special.  Yes its expensive but their is something very special about this hotel and we can't wait to go back again.","5","2018-11"
"Dubai ecstasy","What a great hotel it is. What a site. Has thus became the brand ambassador of hotels in Dubai. It's awesome experience can't be described with words.
A lifetime experience for all of us.
Height of luxury.","5",
"Still the best!!!!","Even after 12 years it is still the best and our favorit !!! Make a nice tour with the with Rolls l Royce,use the indoor pool,visit Madinat Souq.go by bus and metro to explore Dubai,like Spice and Gold Souq.","5","2019-05"
"A true Gem to visit/stay. Ask for floor 19 if staying. ","We stayed here for two nights to check out what’s all the fuss about :). 

It was a well deserved experience and the hotel staff are always at hand to make sure they say Yes to all your questions/ queries. 

The current best views are of the palm island side, compared to the other construction side. 

The suites are very grand and luxurious, however I do feel in the coming years they will be refurbishing too. 

The pool area is amazing and they do have beach access via a buggy service as well. 

Overall great stay and wish them all the best. ","5","2019-05"
"Outstanding experience","You expect a lot but you get more. The way you feel guest is amazing and never experienced before. So personalised and so fantastic. Yes the Burj al Arab is expensive, but the experience makes it worth to put this on your bucket list. ","5","2019-05"
"THE BEST HOTEL","It is something amazing, everything is perfect, from the moment U arrive. I will never forget how I felt, in the room, in the restaurants, everything what about me. They know how to make U feel special, they do not need to tell U how much stars they are, because U feel it in all. Just enjoy !!!","5","2019-05"
"The worst service","Avoid at all costs 
The service is the worst we have ever experienced and we have been traveling to Dubai for many years.
They need to seriously look at the senior management team and re-train them
The hotel lacks any kind of vibe and is in serious need of a refurb - which we hear they are in talks of doing! 
The staff are unmotivated.
If you are celebrating a special occasion,  definitely avoid - no one cares! ","1","2019-05"
"Best experience ","Pamper yourself once in a while, it was an amazing 😉 stay 👍 definitely we will come back again, foods were decent. Yeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy🤩
Receptionist Heart is so warm and welcoming.
Our butler Derrick was helpful and all the employees.🤗","5","2019-05"

I have made the best experience in Burj Al Arab.
All of employee are moderate and kind to me, so I felt bery comfortable.
If I go Dubai again, I will stay in Burj Al Arab.

"Love it!","Stayed at the Burj for four nights and loved every minute if it. Much has been said about how over the top the hotel is but what really sets it apart is the service. Arriving way before check-in time, Private check-in was immediately done by Heart in our two-floored suite. This was much appreciated as there was no waiting time unlike other hotels that make tired guests wait for hours just to check-in. Heart was just fantastic as she proceeded to write down all the amenities and restaurants of the hotel per floor! The fabulous service continued throughout our stay. In Al Iwan restaurant, not only was the food delicious but Regina and the entire team were also very welcoming and were all smiles. Many thanks to Chito for the room service and our butlers for all the help. Amazing, amazing hotel staff who were all welcoming, helpful and just seemed so happy to work in the Burj😍  Bathroom amenties were all 200ml Hermes bottles and perfume. For water, they have free unlimited Acqua Panna bottles. They also gave diffrent turn down gifts each night and complimentary snacks for the afternoon . If anything at this price point, i only wished that they prepared robes and slippers for my 5 year old daughter when we arrived like they do in Ritz and in Aman hotels. But this was really a minor issue and when i asked the items from our butler it was immediately delivered to our room. Facilities and the pools were likewise all great! We're hooked, we had so much fun and would use this hotel when we come back to Dubai!!","5","2019-05"
"Burj Al Arab - Sheer Luxury","Right from booking to check in and then checkout.. the feel was just awesome and luxury.. Hotel staff are very courteous and take the effort to make you feel that you are special guest. Surely recommend to stay at this luxurious hotel to pamper yourself and make yourself feel extra special...","5","2019-05"
"Opulence at its finest","First of all I would like to say a big thank you to Manesh, the Butler who took care of me and my wife on the 10th floor. The service and care provided by him was absolutely outstanding and it was a pleasure to have him as a butler, truly someone who loves his job and is always willing to help.

What can I say? The rooms, the lobby, the pool, the restaurants, everything is simply amazing. If you’re seeking the finer things and you’re not concerned about the price, definitely stay here when you visit Dubai. We thought we had seen luxury hospitality before but nothing like this we could have ever imagined. The hotel is truly, ONE OF A KIND! ","5","2019-05"
"a memorable holiday at the Burj Al Arab","it was perfect - such a memorable Holiday - excellent breakfast, a lot of lunch Restaurants and perfect dinner Locations. 
We have had a fantastic 3 bedroom Suite in the 21 th floor - perfect Service during our holiday","5","2019-05"
"When only the Best will do.","This is the most over the top hotel on the world and the best. We have had many stays here over almost 20 years and have loved every one. Nothing to fault any time. Best location, great service. Nothing is too much trouble for them. As part of the Jumeirah complex you have get a hotel buggy and lagoon boat to many restaurants within. And shopping also.","5","2019-05"

"Opulence and Elegance but it doesn't come cheap.","Ask for Dinesh if you want top tier personal service. He is fabulous! Food is great but very expensive, you get what you pay for though. Service is top notch, everybody is friendly. Never had an issue staying there for the last 5 yrs. Highly recommend it. Its a once in lifetime experience. Nicest pool in Dubai.If you can get a Cabana, make the pool much more fun and offers a AC room to cool down from the intense heat. ","5","2019-05"
"Iconic and Opulent Property","We are a family of 4 from New York. We had traveled to Dubai about 2 years ago on our way to the Maldives and stayed at Burj Al Arab (BAA) for several days. We loved our stay.

Driving towards BAA from the airport was an experience in and of itself. Seeing the iconic sail shaped hotel from far away is a sight you will never forget. Upon pulling up to the curb, staff members greet you by name and take you directly to your room for check in, which took all of 2 minutes. 

We stayed in a 1 BR suite. Saying 1 BR suite almost sounds quaint but the 1 BR suite at BAA is ginormous! The suite is composed of 2 floors with stairs leading up to the bedroom and a bathroom that features a gigantic hot tub. My kids were 8 and 6 at the time and they swam in the tub! Back to the room: downstairs has a desk, couches, bar and a huge tv. The most impressive feature? The view. Wow, the view of Persian Gulf will take your breath away. I could stare at the calm waters of the gulf for a long long time. 

The overall decor of the property, including our room, isn't really our style. Shall we say the decor of BAA is opulent and, dare I say, a bit tacky? Nonetheless, the places exudes and breathes luxury. 

As we did many excursions, we didn't get too many chances to explore the hotel but we did try couple of restaurants, which were decent. 

Now, is it worth the money? Well, for us it was ... for a once in a life time opportunity to stay at this property. Would we go back if we are ever in Dubai again? Most likely not, unless we hit the lotto.","5","2018-06"
"exceptional","Hotel and magnificent frame. Excellent breakfast. Magic and very comfortable suites
Warm welcoming, careful personnel and fautless service.
Special thanks to Adlin!
We will certainly return despite the exhorbitant prices","5","2019-04"
"GREAT EXPERINCE","The Burj Al Arab is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Of the tallest hotels in the world, it is the fifth tallest, although 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) from Jumeirah Beach ..","5","2018-09"

"""Best of the Burj""","The Burj Al Arab was definitely and unforgettable experience. From the perfect arrival to the perfect room with a view. The entire hotel was extremely luxurious and most defiantly 7 star. Great service through out the entire stay all the way from the beginning with reception to the end with everyone else who was at our service.  The rooms were exquisite, amazing pool and pool bar for lounging and amazing restaurants all around the hotel. Even did a little camel riding by the pool deck!!! Definitely looking forward to another stay!","5","2019-04"

","5","2019-04"
"Luxury at its best","With an advance reservation it is possible to visit the hotel, only the areas open to non- guest and have a snack and a cocktail at the terrace overlooking the beach.
Without reservation would be impossible to get passed the hotel security and  visit the place.
It is worth the visit.
At the hotel restaurant there's a minimum consumption amount of about  50 EUR.
Memorable visit while on business trip in Dubai.","5","2019-04"
"never stayed in 7 star before surprise for my wife,","found the whole experience excellent, all staff were really helpful and friendly had an amazing time.as we are not wealthy just average people had a fantastic time,but as before noticed other guest getting complimentary items at pool where we didnt and i think my money is as good as the privileged.","5","2019-05"
"Night of Royalty","For nightly rate, I don't think they need to charge double for drinks and shisa. Shisha service and quality was the worst I had in Dubai. You can get better on a desert safari for a fraction of the price","3","2019-05"
"Luxury at its best ","I received a boxed bouquet of beautiful red roses at the entrance (which I brought back home with me). We had a panoramic one bedroom suite and it was spectacular. The suite was luxurious, the plush furniture, marble bathroom with gold faucets, Hermes toiletries and so much more. I didn’t want to ever leave the suite! The view was breath taking. Our butler was very helpful and had great suggestions for us. The terrace has two pools, the fresh water pool with a swim up bar and the salt water infinity pool with four jacuzzis. The sunbeds are on sand so it gives it a beach feel. The air conditioned cabanas is perfect if it gets too hot. We enjoyed a simple but delicious lunch while relaxing by the pool. 
I’m already planning my next trip. ","5","2018-12"

Almost impossible to get better service anywhere else in the world.After dinner, take in the view of the beautiful Dubai skyline from Gold On 27. It'll just take your breath away.","5",
"First Class Experience","Burj Al Arab provided a first class experience and a price to match. This is as good as it gets but its away from everything. Great adjacent beach. Built for the select few non-mortals that aren't phased by price. Very opulent or as my companion put it: Russian Oligarch Chic. I very mush enjoyed the seafood restaurant. ","4","2018-11"
"Amazing Experience, Truly Unforgettable","After staying 6 nights in the Dubai Creek Area we checked in at the Burj Al Arab, an experience we had always wished for. We had asked for a very early check-in so we would not waste our last day in Dubai. They were true to their word and within 15 minutes of arriving we were offered welcoming refreshments by Mia and Ashraf before being escorted to our room 1605 on the 16th floor (great view of the City skyline). Superb view as all the rooms have I am sure. The two level room was amazing and so large and impressive a feeling of pure indulgence.

Febriana, our butler was very professional and approachable, we familiarised ourselves with a tour of our room she was very friendly and as we had checked out early from our hotel they did not know if we had eaten. Imagine our surprise when they had prepared a lovely breakfast laid out beautifully on our dining table, a nice touch. Later she presented my wife with a bouquet of red roses and me with a belated birthday cake which was 4 days earlier; it was extremely generous of her and the Burj.

Fadi our butler was a great guy, we felt like we had know him for many years with his helpful and friendly mannerism, he gave me a tour of the upper levels and to the Burj boutique where I purchased a Burj golf shirt, excellent quality. Can I also thank you for presenting my wife and myself with personal gifts which was very touching.
We felt like VIP's and you truly are excellent in your chosen profession.

Camara, from Housekeeping asked if we required a turning down service, we said yes and he did an excellent job, he was also very professional and friendly, we were very impressed as we were with all the staff we had contact with.

Camie was our morning butler and she was also amazing, as helpful as all three of the butler's have been. All the Butler's have been so genuine and I can only applaud the management for employing such talented personnel.

When we checked out again Ashraf and Mia were there to offer refreshments and assistance as we waited for our Emirates Chauffeur Service to take us to our Business Class Check-in. Finishing our holiday in style, If you are wondering, we are not rich people, but I would suggest everyone to sample a night in the Burj, it will leave you with everlasting memories.

Thank you all again for your commitment and professionalism, making our stay so memorable and a fitting end to my 65th birthday holiday.","5","2019-04"
"Luxury at it’s best","If you seek luxury, Burj Al Arab is the address. Beautiful designs that you won’t see anywhere else in the globe.. with a twist of Arabia and fine cuisine.. Al Muntaha restaurant is a great place overlooking the Arabian gulf. A stunning sunset view","5","2018-12"

"A Jewel in Dubai","Spend on night in this amazing place, loved everything about it. You get your own butler, to assist you. The view was stunning and the food the best I have ever had. Would come and stay here once again.","5","2018-06"
"Business & pleasure trip","Burj Al Arab is a unique hotel indeed, and deserve more than 7 stars as rating. The service, cleanliness and atmosphere makes the stay to be memorable. Certainly, the experience is totally different than any other hotel.","5","2019-04"
"Iconic and world class","Stayed for 4 nights and would go back tomorrow! All the staff are excellent and can’t be more helpful. The butler service is the best I have experienced as some, especially in cities can be a let down.

Great breakfast choice and setting. Only downside would be the gold bar but I will review that separately.

All in all the level of service is outstanding, the decor etc is on it own level especially if you see how the hotel itself was designed and but and the obstacles to overcome. 

Lastly a mention to the guys on the door who do a great job of getting taxi’s etc.

Hopefully it can keep its level of exclusivity and not have to open too much to big bus tours. ","5","2019-04"
"A memorable stay","Burj Al Arab Jumerirah is a beautiful and luxurious hotel. The staff there are professional, welcoming and helpful. It is definitely worth the money to have that once in a lifetime experience.

"Once in a lifetime experience","Our exhilarating experience started from the security gates of the famous Burj Al Arab, where we got the feeling that we were entering some sort of a Royal Palace. The drive to the hotel has an amazing view of the shoreline. The best part for us was the lobby with huge aquariums, as you go up (or down) the escalators to (from) the mezzanine lobby you could observe very colourful fish escorting you to the next level. Every time I go there I feel like I’m in a fairy-tail.  Burj Al Arab offers a good choice of unique restaurants and all of them are equally fabulous. However, our favourite restaurant & lounge is located on the top floor, where you could see (almost) the whole Dubai. The food is delicious & cocktails are a state of the art. The prices are very high but if you have a special occasion to celebrate then it’s definitely worth it! I would say that a dinner for 2 people will easily cost you $1,000 but it’ll also depends on the choice of alcohol you consume. My personal recommendation would be to go there with your loved one for a very special occasion. Trust me, your wallet & your conscious will not thank you for it, but your special person will never forget this “one I’m a life time” experience.","5",
"Yes its still 7 stars but .................................","It was our second stay at the Burj and the service is excellent, breakfast great, rooms sensational, butlers top class but..............the new terrace doesn't match the iconic Burj. 
The pools are very crowded at the weekend, security work hard to stop casual visitors straying into the area, noisy and manic around the beach style pool. Groups buying day tickets with many unattended young children.
Is this really the vision that the Burj wanted to create or has income overtaken exclusivity ?","4","2019-04"
"Amazing place and amazing services!","All you need just a touch of button!  Amazing place and amazing services! Dont think we had the same experience at any other hotel in the world. Cant wait to go to Dubai and stay in Burj Al Arab again. Highly recommend!","5","2019-04"
"An Experience to Remember","Was one of the first guests to visit this extraordinary hotel when it first opened. Firstly I think you should go online and view the documentary on TV or online as to how this was built to appreciate the level of sweat and expertise and passion has gone into this building and the impeccable guest satisfaction to cater for every whim one has when travelling. Suitable for all this really is a place of tranquility and decadence be it family or couples or business this is a must see attraction either for a few nights stay and be sure to get butler service or perhaps even book for an afternoon tea or lunch in the underwater seafood restaurant. Either way you will want to come back Year after year and it will only get better and better! You only live once!","5","2018-08"

"Birthday girl ","What can you say about this hotel that has not been said before,it may be 20 years old but it is a one off. When you have the privilege of walking through its front entrance you are blown away by the bling. We had a table booked at the top bar (sky bar) to reach this you enter a special lift all the way to the highest point of the hotel,what awaits is a major Wow,we had a window seat and the view is amazing. Now on to the service experience 7 star we were in the capable hands of Marky the food !! We’ll all I can say is have a appetite the food is unlimited you get a complimentary glass of champagne Cristal,all in all after after 3 hours photographs so much food the dream ends,and you head down to the foyer for more photos never felt rushed for one minute,a amazing afternoon never to be repeated in any other country ","5","2019-04"
"Sublime experience in an outstanding hotel","My wife and I had our best holiday ever in the best hotel of the World - and also the most expensive we ever stayed at, but definitely worth the pay.

"Pure Luxury","We had a suite on level 13 - the room was amazing although I was surprised to have pull out sofa beds for the children - the small things made the differences such as Hermes toiletries inc perfume & aftershave - the snacks between 5pm - 8pm were a little disappointing as we were expecting savoury light bites but got kit kat & a few sponge cakes and were forgotten on a couple of occasions. The staff were very courteous & helpful and the buggy's to get you around are great. We hired a cabana for the day but we only managed to see the on call waiter once even though we pressed the service call several times. In the end we just called the passing by pool staff to get a drink. We ate at the Signature Seafood restaurant which was amazing and would definitely recommend. ","4","2019-04"
"Afternoon Tea at the Burq Al Arab","We had afternoon tea in the lobby. The food was very good, there were seven courses and we were offered champagne or sparkling apple juice with gold leaf. However having had tea at the Goring and the Savoy in London I wouldn’t say by comparison it was 7 stars. The table was slightly to low to easily fit your legs underneath and the chairs were a bit outdated. 
At one point a lady decided to take selfies infront of our table with her selfie stick hanging right over our table. Bearing in mind she could have stood anywhere else. I didn’t think this was acceptable and after she did the same thing to another table the manager was quick to intervene and resolve the situation.
The entire experience was good, but I wouldn’t go back as it was very expensive for what it was.","3","2019-04"
"Burj Al Arab – Extraordinary by any metric","The Burj Al Arab is not just a hotel – it’s a destination unto itself.  Once you gain access to this special world there is so much to experience that you may not feel like leaving the hotel until check out time.  

Make sure that your paperwork is in order prior to arrival at the private gate that guards the bridge entrance to the Burj.  We arrived around one and a half hours before check in time and I didn’t have my reservation confirmation readily available, so the guards politely denied us entry until we had our paper work squared away.

After checking in our room was not ready due to our early arrival so we were escorted by an associate to the Burj Al Arab Terrace at the rear of the hotel.  The Terrace is set over the waters of the Arabian Gulf and offers magnificent views.  The Terrace is immense with three pools, cabanas, a bar area, the Scape restaurant and large amounts of walking space.  All the staff were very helpful and friendly with whatever request or question I posed to them.  There are also indoor pools and guests have access to a magnificent private beach.

Even though the Burj is the one of the world’s tallest hotels, it never felt crowded since there are only 202 rooms, ranging in size from about 1800 to almost 4000 square feet.  Even at full capacity there is likely to be less than 600 guests roaming this huge hotel.

We were escorted to our room at 3PM.  Each floor has its own concierge and butler at the guest’s disposal.   We chose to stay in the two floor 2400 square foot panoramic suite – the incredible views of the ocean, beach and city views on both sides of the suite were well worth the additional cost. 
The first-floor layout included a large living room, sitting area, bathroom, dining area and an office area with a large desk and an Apple desktop computer. 
The spiral staircase leading to the second floor adds to the majesty of the room with its polished chrome and beautiful design.

The second floor contained a large bedroom, sitting area and a totally over the top immense bathroom with a large shower, double sink and a jacuzzi bathtub.  The room amenities, décor and appearance were flawless in almost every way imaginable and the rooms were impeccable clean.

The Burj Al Arab has been opened for almost 20 years but the entire facility is so meticulously maintained that the hotel has the appearance of being brand new.  

You would expect no less, but mention should be made of the world class mattress which provided off the charts sleeping comfort - you will not find a more comfortable mattress anywhere.  A nice touch is that there is a full size mirror above the bed.

No hotel runs with flawless precision and that’s OK - it’s how things are handled after a guest mentions a problem or poses a question that matters most.   For example, the following little bumps in the road occurred during my visit:

The butler asked me what newspaper I would like to receive daily and I said the Wall Street Journal.  For whatever reason I did not receive the Wall Street Journal but instead was provided with the Gulf News, a highly respected and well written newspaper that covers local and world events.

My wife requested two pillows from the pillow menu from the butler who apparently forgot the request since we never got the pillows until the following night when we requested them again; no big deal.

At the breakfast buffet at the Bab Al Yam, the hostess seated us and asked us our choice of beverage and then apparently immediately forgot our order.  Half way through our breakfast I mentioned to the hostess who seated us that we had not received the coffee and tea ordered and he apologized, and the order was promptly delivered.
The food selection at breakfast could be larger but was generally spectacular in taste, quality and presentation.  The décor of the Bab Al Yam was quite memorable; this is just one of many reasons why the Burj Al Arab is world renown and the flagship hotel of Dubai.

The cost of a room at the Burj Al Arab varies depending on the season and the type of room but I thought the cost was reasonable.

The best part of traveling is to experience world unique places and the Burj Al Arab ranks at the top no matter what metric you chose to use.  Staying at this resplendent jewel of a hotel was certainly a most pleasant event and one certainly worth repeating.","5","2018-05"
"RUDE STAFF IN REALITY. Just want TIPS","Hotel is nice. I’ve stayed there a few times but the staff is rude and extremely unhelpful. They pretend that they care but in reality all the want is their tip: u tip them and they move on to the next. They DO NOT have a caring attitude and this is a hotel wide thing. SECURITY guards are rude. The hotel also charges 200 dirhams for outside tourists to come and see the hotel which makes it a FISH market in the evening. If you want to spend 2K a night then best is to go to Bulgari hotel. It’s much better and the staff makes sure they help you out.","1","2019-04"

Everything are nice, except [1] internet speed is very slow; [2[ the towels in the bathroom are old, and overly used so long. the color turns to grey, my wife was shocked to see there is a big hole in the towel on the second day!","4","2019-04"

"Good 5 star but not 7","We visited the Burj Al Arab for evening drinks in the Sky View bar. The welcome was lovely and we were transferred to a window seat willingly when we asked. The drinks and food were very good - as good as the best 5 star hotels we have used. However, there was nothing that took the experience beyond good 5 star other than the price ! There were two items on the drinks menu that were not available and the waiting staff forgot our desert order. A great experience but did not live up to expectations.","4","2019-04"

"Opulent!!!","If you are ever in a position to stay at this hotel take it!
I think for the average citizen this would be for a very special occasion.
Prepare yourself to spend some money on food, drinks, high-end shopping, and tipping but....
What an experience! I was hesitant to take my children on this trip but I did and it was no issue at all. In fact my 5 year old and teen were so mesmerized by the suite we were in that we actually ordered room service because they didn't want to leave.
The staff was top notch, very friendly and went out of their way to help you with anything you may need.
Great views of The World Islands and The Palm Jumeirah.
No issues taking photos all over the hotel. They allowed me to explore and snap pictures everywhere.
There is a kids club for smaller children, a library, gym, indoor and out door pools, event rooms, bar's, stores...Oh and did I mention a helipad!
Pricy but a wonderful family experience.","5",
"Terrific, again and again!!!","We’re always looking forward to our next stay and can’t wait. For those, who once had the opportunity, there won’t be need to explain.
Extraordinary place with extraordinary and excellent service. Stuff is trying to read from your eyes. If you are repeated guest, it’s something like “homecoming “. Thank you for always preparing an unforgettable stay!!!","5",
"Close to Perfection","My hubby and I went for High Tea in the Skyview Bar at the Burj Al Arab and it was close to perfection. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious, they were very accommodating with allergies and dietary restrictions. The entertainment was amazing, there was a harpist playing while we were there. So why is the title of my review ""Close to Perfection"" ... we had hoped that we would be able to walk around the entire Skyview Bar so we could see the view all the way around but we were only allowed in one particular area, the other area was cordoned off and of course that was the area facing the Palm Island. It was a little disappointing.","4","2019-01"

"The best of the best!","We spent a long weekend for our anniversary and we could not have found anywhere better.  Attention to detail from everybody at the hotel and their focus upon the clients is why this place is considered to be the best in the world.  It may be luxurious and full of quality but without the smiles and the hard work of the people how are there to make your stay one of the greatest memories you will have.  There is always a reason to go back and we certainly will.","5","2018-10"
"Few days in Dubai","I just love this hotel.  The outside is stunning, and the view from the suite we had was breath taking.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the Butlers you get on every floor are terribly helpful.  All the staff we met were very pleasant, and nothing was too much trouble.  The bar at the top of the building had incredible views, and wonderful cocktails.","5","2019-03"
"Class personified","The hotel from the outside looking in seems ostentatious, however once visited the friendliness and the magnificence of the building become evident. From the greeting upon arrival, to the days our butler helped us arrange matters was excellent.

The attention to detail and cleanliness I have never seen in a hotel before, however this does come with a price!

Breathtaking building from outside & even within with no expense spared for luxury, but also importantly the quality of the staff & service provided.

There is a good choice of restaurants to suit most palates and you still have the ability to visit neighbouring hotels with a buggy ride to experience life outside Burg Al Arab too.

Security is tight, but inconspicuous, with the funniest scenes of people having their pictures took even posing by lying on their sides in the lobby lol

Overall, for anyone looking for that special occasion or quality & relaxation break the Burg Al Arab is a must.","5","2019-04"
"Burj Al Arab","The Burj Al Arab holds up to its reputation!  The rooms, view, and amenities are amazing!  However, the breakfast buffet selection is limited and of average taste.  There are other 5-star hotels in the area that offer a much more grand breakfast buffet selection and of high quality.   ","5","2019-04"
"Drinks and canapes at Gold on 27 - a taste of luxury","My wife and I visited Burj Al Arab for drinks and canapes at Gold on 27 as part of a cruise ship excursion. The only way to see the decadent inside of this '7-star' hotel is to stay here or to have a booking for drinks, afternoon tea or cocktails, as without an appointment you won't get beyond the security gate that leads to a private road to the hotel.
On arrival we took the gold elevators (there is lots of gold in this hotel) to the 27th floor for drinks and snacks with a view. Note that all the rooms in the hotel are two storeys tall, so the 27th floor is actually 54 floors tall, and the big glass windows offered some spectacular views of Jumeirah and Dubai. It was a little hazy when we were there at sunset but you could still make out clearly the Burj Khalifa in the distance.
The canapes we were served by the waiting staff were delicious and the wine was good, but everything in the hotel was simply stunning, and even the toilets were amazing with (real) gold bins and trim, and instead of disposable paper towels you have individual flannels to dry your hands and cologne to freshen up.
It was a true taste of luxury and a memorable experience. It would be amazing to stay here but it's really beyond our current budget, but the whole experience was amazing and is highly recommended to try at least once if ever visiting Dubai.","5","2018-12"
"Top of the bill! World Class!!! Must See from the inside!!!","Staying at this hotel is more for the rich and famous. Your humble servant is not like wise ;-)  A room exceeds easy 2000$/night. The hotel is well protected against nosy or other ""unwanted"" people. You won't get past the outside gate without a reservation. But just there is a desk where you can order an afternoon cappuccino for 250 AED. WHAT??? Yes ;-) For this price you enjoy a wonderful mocktail with camel milk, then the cappuccino covered with 24kt gold powder, a desert and a sweet with some gold foil, everything in a amazing decorum, a masterpiece in decoration which will leave you astonished by its extravaganza. If you come that far, you should not be refrained by the ticket. The experience will stick to your ribs for a life time ;-)","5","2019-03"

"Hotel review: Dubai's 7-star Arabian Tower, Burj Al Arab","'Burj Al Arab' roughly translates to Arabian Tower, and if you don't know the hotel by name, you will undoubtedly recognise the shape of the iconic, billowing dhow sail shape.

In September 2018, we were in Dubai visiting family, and Jumeirah kindly offered to host us for a few nights at the Burj al Arab hotel. Calling it a 5-star deluxe property does it no justice.

The world’s only 7-star hotel

Day 1 - Arrival

After a controlled security checkpoint, we drove over a short 100-metre curved bridge and pulled up to the hotel entrance, feeling slightly out of place in our little rental car, surrounded by Ferraris and other supercars. The hotel has a fleet of white Rolls Royce Phantoms lined up ready for airport transfers and local journeys.

Walking past the many door staff and into the vast 180-meter tall atrium, suddenly the magnitude of this hotel hit us. The hotel is the tallest all-suite hotel in the world standing at 321 metres but with only  202 rooms, or should I say duplex suites.

We were ushered to a sofa on one side of the lobby and brought some dates, water and cold scented towel to refresh from September's autumn heat outside.

Check-in

Having been escorted up to the 18th floor, we presented our passports to the reception desk (each of the 24 floors has a dedicated desk) and met our butler. After a tour of the suite, the butlers brought us some complimentary fruit juices and completed the check-in formalities in the office. The suite's own office.

The Room

Our two bedroom deluxe suite was the second biggest suite I've personally stayed in, and the kids were super excited hearing that it had giant jacuzzi bathtubs that could fit all five of us in. Comfortably.

Walking through what I can only describe as akin to the front door of a mansion, it took a few seconds to adjust our eyesight to the gold everywhere. Then we found a guest bathroom, office with desk and iMac, casual living room and sweeping staircase up to the bedrooms with a working clock projected onto the wall. Before heading upstairs, we were taken through the double doors at the end of the casual lounge to reveal a more formal lounge, dining room seating ten, kitchen and butlers entrance.

By this time, the kids had already run around and explored the entire suite. Twice. We met them upstairs with its master bedroom, seating area and dressing room and then a second bedroom, equal in size but with a dressing area rather than a dedicated dressing room. Both ensuite bathrooms have a shower and bath that would meet the requirements of most guests and their entourage. I nearly forgot; every master bed has a ceiling mounted mirror so remember to take take the eye masks from your flight.

Your hardest decision is whether to open the full-size Hermes products or pack them quickly to re-gift later.

Room categories

There are 202 luxury duplex suites: 

142 one bedroom suites.
28 two bedroom suites.
18 panoramic suites with one bedroom.
4 club suites with one bedroom and pool table.
6 diplomatic suite with three bedrooms.
2 presidential suites with two bedrooms.
2 royal suites with two bedrooms and a rotating bed.

Day 2 - The Terrace

It didn't take long to unpack thanks to our Amazon packing cubes, considered as the best thing since sliced bread, so we headed down to the pool deck and then again on our second day.

This wasn't part of the original hotel construction, but in true Burj Al Arab style, it's magnificently opulent and designed to service even the most discerning of customers. I may be one of those fussy customers, but the complimentary amenities delivered every couple of hours certainly helped.

We tried out most of the facilities including:

1 saltwater swimming pool.
1 freshwater swimming pool.
4 hot tubs.
24 cabanas.
8 royal cabanas.
1 restaurant.
2 bars (one swim-up).
1 underground changing room and shop complex.
poolside spa treatments.

The Royal Cabana

We had friends staying at The Atlantis, so they joined us for the day, and I booked a Royal Cabana by the saltwater pool at the end of the deck. There are smaller two-person Standard Cabanas which we took for the other days of our stay, mostly so the kids could stay out of the sun and my wife could stay out of the shade.

A private, poolside air-conditioned area with a TV, bar, sofas, deck chairs, ensuite bathroom, shower and a balcony overlooking the sea.

To take full advantage, I checked into the Royal Cabana at 8am then after breakfast nipped over to The Atlantis to collect our friends. You do feel like royalty in a Royal Cabana, with hotel staff never more than an earshot away should you need anything. You can relax on a sun lounger all day if you want with everything coming to you without ever needing to get up off the bed.

We absolutely loved these and would highly recommend them if you can justify the whopping daily price tag.

Royal Cabanas start at GBP £1,000 (discounts available for hotel guests)
Standard Cabanas GBP £450 (can also be booked for half days)

Restaurants

We sat outside for the breakfast buffets which had more than enough choice for us although the kids did gravitate towards the pancake station. For lunches, we ate at the poolside restaurant Space or in the Cabana.

There were many other restaurants, all I'm sure, equally as great.

One night we ate in a restaurant in the nearby Madinat hotel and then for our final night, we joined our friends for the buffet dinner at The Atlantis.

Bars

This was a family holiday with the kids so we couldn't really use the bars, but I've had evening drinks at both the poolside terrace and 24th-floor Gold Lounge which had a price tag to match their exclusive atmosphere.

Beach

We didn't visit the beach during this time, but there are sections of the main Jumeirah beach reserved for Burj Al Arab guests. You take a short hotel buggy ride from just outside the lobby.

What does it cost?

Where do I begin? It's expensive, there's no getting away from that, but I guess it's relative so you'll need to decide this yourself.

Offseason you can get deals from around £1,000 per night for the one-bedroom suite or £2,500 for the two-bedroom suite. The bigger options are rarely discounted and you're looking at £5,000+ for the three-bedroom diplomatic suite and £10,000+ for the mammoth Royal Suite (there are two of these and they take up the entire 25th floor).

Nice touches

As you'd expect from an ultra, ultra, luxury hotel, they go above and beyond.

If they catch you carrying your own bags, a butler is swiftly dispatched to assist.

A daily visit from the dancing butlers to your suite with a mobile pick-n-mix station of candy and chocolate.

Your preferences are carefully noted and butlers adjust fruit baskets, room temperature and bath salts accordingly.

Packing and unpacking service with Burj Al Arab branded tissue paper between layers.

Helicopter transfers if you want to escape the Dubai traffic for that private jet.

In summary

A one-off experience that we will likely do again and again; it's so hard to fault the hotel. I don't even think that 'hotel' is the right word, 'Palace' is more fitting.

Would I stay again?

Absolutely yes and we've been lucky enough to stay four times now. However, I've heard the One & Only Royal Mirage is also great for family holidays and lighter on the wallet..

Would I recommend it?

Yes and no. If you can do it, then stay for a few nights (the average stay is 2 nights) for the bucket list experience and kudos. It is a truly memorable experience. For more extended stays, I would look at hotel options with a balcony as you may want to appreciate the Arabic weather rather than being in a glass-encased suite.

"This was on our Bucket list","Twenty years ago, we first learned about The Burj al Arab and said that some day, we would stay there for one night.  Last week,  we were able to fulfill that dream.  And it was truly a dream come true.  From the pick up in a 740 LI BMW, when I was given a box of long stemmed red roses to our ride to the airport in the same beautiful car, we were treated royally.  We arrived early and were still taken right to our room-where we were checked in and given a tour of the 2 story suite.  We were dressed in jeans and still treated very well-this place isn't stuffy about dress code.  The suite was jaw droppingly elegant.  The grand staircase was so beautiful-marble covered by a navy blue and gold runner.  The downstairs featured an office area, a bar, a dining area and a huge living room with floor to ceiling windows.  The view was out to the gulf, downtown Dubai and terrace pool.  The remote controlled everything, including the curtains.  There is a half bath on this floor, too.
Upstairs is the biggest bed I have ever seen-it was about 10x10 feet.  I heard it cost $20,000.  Over the bed was a ceiling mirror.  There was another bar with a pop up tv by the floor to ceiling windows.  The tv popped up so as not to obscure the view.  The walk in closet was as big as a normal hotel room.  The bathroom was almost beyond description-a huge double vanity, toilet, bidet, jacuzzi and multi jetted shower.
As for room amenities the list is HUGE-
bottled water, cider and date sparkling drink, a box of dates and a plate of fruit upon check in.
about $600 worth of full size Hermes shampoo, conditioner, lotion, cologne, perfume etc, toothbrushes, toothpaste and mouth wash,  shaving kit, nail kit, comb and memory foam slippers.
Our butler brought us snacks of shrimp, salmon and cheese along with another bouquet of long stemmed red roses and a chocolate mousse cake.
He also drew us a bubble bath in the jacuzzi complete with rose petals strewn all over the bathroom.

As part of our package, we had a couple massage.  It was sheer heaven.  Easily the best massage I have ever had.  The indoor infinity pool was so nice-on the 18th floor with a spectacular view.

We also took a buggy ride to see the other Jumeirah properties and take a boat ride (abra) through the canals at the marina .

We asked if we could take pictures of the Rolls Royces that the hotel has.  They not only let us take pix inside the car, they took us for a ride in it.  Such a treat.

Our butler took us on a tour of the hotel and all it's other restaurants, including the Sky bar and the aquarium restaurant.

We had a wonderful dinner at Al Iwan-the Arabian restaurant.  Delicious!
 They made us a plate of fresh berries and the skyline of Dubai in cinnamon and Dubai written in chocolate and gave me another bouquet of roses-this time pink and white. While we were there a really loud group kept talking across the dining room and even stood very near our table to make phone calls.  We told our server and they were immediately asked to be more respectful. I mentioned that the cumin is so much better in Dubai and the maitre'd gave me 2 containers to bring home.

Since we had to check out before the breakfast buffet, we had a wonderful breakfast packed for us, which we ate at the airport.  The muffin even had gold on top!

This was truly a wonderful experience.  We were totally pampered.  I must note that everything that appears to be gold actually is 24K gold leaf,

The only negative is that it's been a week since we've been home and the pre authorization hold is still on our credit card, even though the charge for the room has been posted to our card.  Many emails and phone calls and we are still trying to straighten it out.

All in all, this place is heaven on earth.","5","2019-03"
"Truly amazing ","After a day of shopping we decided to finish of the evening with drinks in the Sky bar. 

We booked a table and took the lift up to the bar. Staff were efficient with showing us to our table.

We were given a drinks menu which had almost anything you could want. We chose a bottle of champagne. Because you have to pay to enter the sky bar, this is taken off of your total bill at the end.

Fantastic night views and friendly staff make for an unforgettable evening ","5","2019-03"

"Hotel is Beautiful ","Indeed a 7* hotel in terms of deco and surroundings! We had make a reservation for lunch at one of the restaurant and thus was able to visit. Lucky was there early, so could enjoy the quietness and majestic architecture. However, when done with lunch, the crowd from tour buses bringing tourists for visitation actually spoil the ambience:( Too crowded :(","4","2019-03"
"A 7 star hotel","A very nice hotel made in the middle of the ocean..a must visit to this place..it also has a Hanging bar which is also a must visit","5",
"Burj al Arab - Tower of the arabs, with some novelties","At the luxury hotel, which looks like a gigantic sail and has long been world famous, the unthinkable became reality in 1999. With its 321 meters, it boasts the highest hotels in the world and is 14 meters taller than the Paris Eiffel Tower. The distinctive design, exposed location on an artificially raised island in front of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel beach, and exuberant luxury have made the Jumeirah Group's luxury hotel Dubai's landmark. In addition, he was nicknamed ""The Finger of Allah in the Persian Gulf"" and given many awards.

There are no rooms here, but 202 luxurious suites, for the sake of simplicity divided into ""small"" and ""large"". Because of their size, even the smaller ones (from 170 sqm) can certainly be described as ""spacious"", the big ones (up to 780 sqm) anyway. The Burj Al Arab offers 27 floors, or better said 28 if you include the permanently frequented heliport, where by the way occasionally spectacular stunt jumps take place, like that of Tiger Woods in 2004.

A 200-meter restaurant provides not only excellent cuisine and exquisite service, but also breathtaking views of the city and seaside. In the Burj Al Arab everything is really gold that glitters: Wide parts of the hotel, the bar, chairs, walls, pillars, just about every candle holder and many other precious items are of 24 carat gold leaf, reflect in an exciting way. Rolls-Royce for to shuttle anywhere, it takes four to six hours to arrange the lush flower bouquets in the lobby, and the suites are always decorated with flower arrangements, even if they are not rented. More than 30 different types of fine marble have been processed on 24,000 square meters, such as those Michelangelo has used, the bedding is made of valuable, hand-picked Icelandic downs from the island, amenities are original bottles by Hermès, the ceiling of the Junsui Bar is equipped with the largest Swarovski crystal chandelier in the world and impresses with 21,000 Swarovski crystals that replicate the Milky Way and the largest stars in the galaxy. Value: 300,000 euros.

The latest highlight is now the 10,000 sqm ""The Terrace"", a private beach area with luxurious daybeds, butler service and huge, stylish infinity pools. In the past, in order to be able to enjoy an adequate beach life, the beach had to be visited by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Now, the elite relaxation life takes place directly in front of the hotel.","5","2019-01"
"Excellent","Brilliant hotel in Dubai service, location, decor , spa, restaurants, security, ambiance ,boutiques, swimming pool, 7star hotel, butler service, transportation,  sirus, most importantly the hotel provides probably the best money for value","5","2019-03"
"The Burj","A perfect view of the burj from the great ambience of the beach. A dominant structure that blows the mind away, if the outside can be this superb  then how would the inside look like.... Unimaginable that is the word.","5","2019-02"
"Champagne afternoon tea","We bought this as a treat for ourselves on a visit to Dubai. Sensational views, lovely staff and the opportunity to visit the hotel, this was a real experience. Not the cheapest afternoon tea in the world but a real treat. All the food was absolutely stunning - if not totally conventional (beef pie anyone?  strange but delicious!). The whole experience is carefully choreographed with your own waiter and it lasts about 2 hours. Difficult to choose which was the best ‘course’, savoury or sweet. It’s clear only the best quality ingredients are used. Would highly recommend this as an experience. 
Although access to the hotel is restricted, you can politely ask to go to the terrace/beach area so you can get a flavour of what it’s like to stay at the hotel. Needless to say, everything is styled in its own unique way and doesn’t fail to impress!","5","2019-03"
"Cocktails at the Burj Al Arab","Very elegant hotel, well worth a visit. The public are not allowed to enter the drive to the hotel without permission. Greeted at the main entrance by very pleasant staff, very welcoming. We showed our cocktail evening pass and were told where to go on our own. Inside the hotel is an experience on its own. We went up to the 27th floor, top floor for our drinks, were greeted by staff and were shown our table. We were offered a choice of drinks from a drinks menu, very enjoyable drinks, accompanied with olives, assorted nuts and some savoury type of cake, very nice if you like olives. Only allowed two drinks when booking a cocktail evening at the Burj Al Arab. The views are brilliant and the hotel is exceptional, it’s expensive but well worth a visit.","5",

"Amazing experience","We went here for the Champagne afternoon tea at the Al Muntaha where you get some terrific views. It was a wedding present to us as we went to Dubai for part of our honeymoon.

It was a truly amazing experience, I genuinely felt we were treated like royalty!

The service was exceptional as was all the food, tea and drink.

"Best valentines treat ever!","I booked the afternoon tea for Valentine’s Day for myself and my husband. We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. Our hostess Regina looked after us so well and made sure all our requirements were met. She even gave us a rose 🌹 card and cake to wish us a happy Valentine’s Day. Well worth the money an excellent indulgent experience!","5","2019-02"
"My stay at the Burj","This was an amazing property and our experience was amazing.  This was a once in a life time trip for us and celebrating our 21st wedding anniversary made it that much more special.  It is too costly for us to visit again!","5","2019-03"

"Birthday celebration was amazing","The beauty of this hotel is nothing short of amazing! I had a drink at the Sky Bar! Everything was good, the drink, the appetizers, the setting and THE VIEW! They even gave me a rose before we left as a gift.  I had a chill drink called Mrs. Big Stuff, it was poured from a porcelain purse with different flavor bitters in basil polish bottles and a grenadine lipstick! Very cool! Very pricey!","5","2019-03"
"best hotel of the world","This was TOP what a beautiful week in the Burj Al Arab.
We were picked up from the airport in a Rolls Roye unbelievable.
Never made anything with what a luxury.
Everyone is so nice everything is over the top is indescribable.","5","2019-03"
"An faultless stay thanks to the incredible service","This is the third time we have stayed at the Burj and as with the previous two stays it is almost impossible to fault. The service is second to none and I feel that is what makes this place what it is. The staff are so helpful, attentive and kind throughout the resort and incredibly often know your name, always greeting you with a smile. The staff at breakfast (on the terrace) couldn’t be more helpful (and gave us the most wonderful welcome back!), especially as we were staying with our 4 small children 7,5,3 and 6 months and regularly helped our children carry items back to the table, make sure they were seated comfortably and cleared up the awful mess they made daily without batting an eyelid. You certainly don’t feel like children aren’t welcome in such a smart place (I have to say we are strict with ours as I wouldn’t feel comfortable having them run amok). The pool terrace staff were always so quick to help me with the buggy and endless bags I was carrying and making sure we were comfy and had enough shade. We really enjoyed splitting our day time between here and Summersalt beach club, where again the service was second to none. They always made sure we were comfortable and well settled with a small baby and young children and we enjoyed the brunch on Friday where we were treated to delicious drinks and food whilst enjoying the dj and lovely views. Again, children are made more than welcome yet it some how maintains a adult sophisticated vibe - quite a feat! We enjoyed all our meals whilst staying at the resort, especially at Scape where the atmosphere is most unique and again the service top notch (they made a great effort to fit us in one Friday night when they were fully booked, no trouble at all)
Our rooms were always immaculate on return (I felt awful if the children trapsed sand in!) and the housekeeping staff worked so hard and were so friendly, one man made beautiful paper crafts to give to my children. The butlers couldn’t do enough to help you and with out a doubt the highlight of the stay for our children was the visit of the “sweetie train” each evening where they get given piles of sweets (which we had to monitor the intake of!) off a cute little train - rather magical for small children! 
We adore staying here and intend to return again if we are able too - it works perfectly for our family holidays as it feels like a family holiday as well as a couples holiday all in one. The only problem with staying here? You get totally spoiled and travelling anywhere else is a disappointment!","5","2019-02"
"Great hotel experience with some flaws.","The Burj Al Arab was the last stop of our trip to Oman and Dubai. Arriving at the hotel opened a new dimension of luxury and service. Check-in was quick, friendly and professional. The introduction and personal service during our stay offered by Daniela was excellent. Our suite was outstanding and offered a great view of the sea and the city. The suites are big, luxuriously furnished (people may have different opinions on style), quite and include great amenities. We enjoyed the Culinary Flight offering a great selection of the many fantastic restaurants (thanks to Daniela we could adjust the selection) and our highlights were the Al Iwan (food and service) and the Nathan Outlaw (atmosphere). 
The breakfast place Bab Al Yam is good, but can not match the experience of the other restaurants. We would have expected a bigger choice of dishes and a different atmosphere. The big number of tourist groups were quite disturbing. A situation that we unfortunately met also in public spaces and partly in the pool area. 
During our stay we also used the very good gym and the excellent spa. A great place to relax and enjoy the view is the pool area. ","5","2019-03"
"view is fantastic","lunch with 5 adults and one child ,first the enter you don't know what you are seeing !
you don't believe your eyes.
The view from the resaurant over the palm Island and then the luch itself , fantasic , service is fenominal and the food .....
you have to get this experience by yourself !","5","2019-03"
"Burj Al Arab","Wow what a place. Way over the top. Had the 1 bedroom apartment, only thing missing would have been an elevator to go up to bedroom/bathroom/sitting area, had to walk up the spiral staircase. Again the room was just way over the top. The view was great, and the room super quiet. A truly spectacular place to stay. The bars at the top was equally great, as was the Al Muntaha. No need to go anywhere if you don't want to. Use the BMW 7 to go to town and sites, if that's too much use the Lexus. The lobby was amazing, only downside is the number of tourist that come for pic's of the place. But then again it is site to behold.","5","2019-02"
"Out of This World","What a drop dead gorgeous hotel, simply stunning. Expensive, yes. Worth six stars, absolutely. Really amazing facility on its own island, connected to land by a causeway. It also sports its own helipad. Simply put, it is out of this world.","5","2018-05"
"Afternoon Tea","This afternoon tea time was a really once-in-a-lifetime experience, that leaves nothing to be desired. Already on arrival at the hotel we were greeted very friendly and courteous and were able to explore the house a little before we took the lift to the Skyview Bar. After a glass of champagne, we were served many delicious delicacies in several courses. It was taken into account that I am a vegetarian. The staff was very pleasantly relaxed friendly. We enjoyed the view of Dubai from a window seat, which I would also recommend, even if it costs a little more.","5","2018-08"
"Fantastic experience!","The hotel makes you feel like in paradise.
Treatment, room fantastic everything perfect.
we had a memorable stay and were very sorry to have to check out.
Highly recomended hotel for couples.
Since the check in spa , restaurants it was just perfect","5","2019-03"
"Short break","We wanted to explore and experience the reputation that Burj Al Arab has. So we booked to stay there 3 nights and from the minute we arrived we felt like royalty! The way you are greeted to the way employees are dressed , their helpfulness and interest in making your stay special is superb! The concept of having Butlers on each floor is excellent and they are there to help you with everything. Booking restaurant to dojng your check in for your flight!
We enjoyed every minute. If you have the money (because it is expensive) you must experience the Burj Al Arab.","5","2019-02"
"Celebrating 20 years of marriage.","A perfect stay on a very luxury hotel. All needs were fullfilled by exelent butler service 24 ours.

"Wonderful stay with excellent staff","We visited over the Christmas period with our 2 young children.  We had a wonderful stay.  The staff were very helpful, especially Vasim, our main butler.  Our room was very impressive, with wonderful views.  We'd travelled overnight from Europe so arrived very early, and they very kindly gave us breakfast in one of the restaurants while the room was getting ready and then we were able to access the room just after breakfast ~10am, where they had also set up a further food and drink.  As it was over Christmas there were different Christmas related foods delivered in the evenings, and they also brought cake and sang happy birthday as the visit was partly for my birthday.  The girls loved decorating the gingerbread house particularly.  We found the breakfast buffet excellent, and enjoyed swimming in both the indoor and outdoor pools, as well as the Wild Wadi water park.  The views from the indoor pool were amazing.  We also ate at Junsui and Al Iwan which were both excellent.  Perfect stay!","5","2018-12"
"Very good hotel but not what it used to be","I last stayed here in 2005 and I recall tons of exotic food being delivered to my hotel room and more amenities than I could possibly use. The extravagance is long gone. Now it is a bit above average but much closer to 5 star than 7.You either like the décor or you don't; I think it is loud but still tasteful. Check-in took a long time and would have taken longer had I not insisted that they move us along and not leave us sitting in the lounge and get our bags upstairs. Our 2 bedroom suite was quite nice and the walk-in closet is a real walk-in closet. The swiss showers and oversized bathrooms were good. A lot of the suite is just wasted space; how much living room can you use here? They put a lot of amenities into the bathroom but they hardly put any food in the room -- some fruit and cake, and i had to ask for it when I checked in because there was nothing there. They come around with some sweets for the kids in the afternoon which is cool for them but provides no wow factor for the adults. Breakfast buffet was very good but nothing out of the ordinary for these parts. The terrace area was closed due to high winds and is more exclusive in name than its reality (it's just a pool area with lounges); the spa upstairs is very nice and I liked the tall windows in the treatment rooms. The indoor pool was very pretty; the outdoor pool was not really heated. The beach is across the bridge and the water was surprisingly cold to me even though it was February. DInner at the fish restaurant was very good; they still have the big acqariums but if you don't insist on a good table they will give you a lousy one. They got rid of the cute submarine ride to the restaurant and put a revenue-producing bar in its place. Fortunately, the day trippers don't get past the lower lobby otherwise it would be animal house in the hotel. The hotel gym is decent but not extravagant. Wild Wadi water park is a bit small and not many rides but the ones they have are very good. Better to go late in the day when it is quiet. The hotel picked us up from the Atlantis helipad and arranged us a day tour of Dubai; the guide we got was mediocre and I had expected that a hotel of this sort would have gotten better guides for us. When I called on the phone pre-arrival, i often found people not picking up their phones and the hotel charges you for their concierges to take care of things such as $50 to go to the Emirates Mall about 2 miles away and pick up some ski Dubai tickets. Really good hotels shouldn't do that; in Tokyo the Four Seasons concierge went across town to get me train tickets and charged me nothing. All in all, it's a good hotel but at over $3,000 a night for a 2 bedroom suite when you factor in all the surcharges, I don't think it's good value for money at this point. Cutting back the Wow stuff was pennywise and dollar foolish and basically negates the reason to come all the way out here.","4","2019-02"
"Went for lunch- had twenty four carat coffee","Never thought to have gold as a part of my drink until i had the Coffee laced with it. Beautiful drink. Beautiful experience. Beautiful place. Wildly beautiful building. Great view of the beach. Incredible interiors as well. Spectacular lay out. You know how you get 7 stars? Iron the table cloths. Wildly wonderful - oh the coffee was 35 dollars. Just saying. Was shocking pricing until i went to the Burj Khalifa. Ohhhhhh.","5","2019-02"
"AI Iwan dinner buffet","Extravagant hotel with well mannered staff. Buffet is mainly Persian food. Good quality though variety is not much. The overall atmosphere is very welcoming and enjoyable. We get complimentary lemon tea with great surprise. Very nice experience","5","2019-02"
"Beyond World Class!","I'm travelling the world for almost 30 years, i have been fortunate to stay at some of the nicest hotels in many of the major cities and tourist destinations around the world. From the best of the best nothing compares to the Burj. You expect nice rooms, views, food and service in 5*+ hotels what you dont expect is their ability to take it further by so many little extra special touches and attention to detail which is unique. I didnt have one bad experience , every single employee from the top of the house to the bottom was magnificent. 
I was also happy that my family and children got to join this trip. They truly loved every day and night.

If you are thinking should i book this , maybe its too much, perhaps i can save $300-400 on taking the next best , well if you can afford, or you feel you deserve it , then just do it. You wont be disappointed and will never regret what you could have saved elsewhere!","5","2019-02"
"Grea!!!","The best hotel experience  ever!! The rooms made me feel like a princess. The service is amazing. The spa is great. Money well spent. You won’t want to leave tbe hotel to go to Dubai’s other attracions. ","5","2019-02"
"wasn't as I expect it","the hotel canceled my reservation without letting me know, that delayed my check in and I'm sure that I didn't canceled my reservation. in general the hotel was good and the room was amazing. however it wasn't as good as I thought. ","3","2019-02"
"Grand! ","From the moment we landed we were taken into their lounge area for refreshments. 
We were then greeted with a bouquet of roses one for my daughter and one for me, we were wisked away to experience the worlds only 7 star hotel.
We had personal waiting for us who knew we were staying there because it was part of our daughter's birthday celebration. 
Upon our arrival we were quickly greeted and taken into our panoramic room, which gave us a spectacular view of  Palm Jumeirah and the Burj Khalifa. 
They serenaded my daughter, bringing her a bouquet of roses and a chocolate cake to our room. Truly spectacular!
If you stay at The Burj Al Arab expect nothing less than class service!

"Iconic and the only 7 star Hotel","It was great experience being at the luxurious hotel. I visited Burj Al Arab Hotel twice.  when it was newly opened in the early 2000. And the other visit when we had dinner at the We paid a reasonable prize of 200 AED per person at the time with my wife and two sons. This beautiful hotel was built on an artificial island across a private bridge. The hotel is accessible by taxi. We dined at the very expensive restaurant. I recommend for first time visitor who would like to see the only 7-star hotel in the world.","5","2018-06"
"Afternoon Tea in Sahn Eddar Lobby","We wanted to get inside the world famous Burj al Arab Hotel and needed a booking to do so. So we went for the afternoon tea in the Sahn Eddar lobby. A truly unique experience and it costs a fortune. 2‘200 AED for 4 people is a lot for tea and finger sandwiches, but to be fair it is in fact a 7 course meal....the quality was without any complaints and definitely on 5 star level. But is it really 7 stars worth? For this price we would actually even expect a little more ‚wow‘. 

However the hotel is quite generous in letting you visit many parts such as the bars and restaurants on level 27 and also the terrace and pool area without additional costs. 

All in all: If you wanna experience the Burj al Arab inside the afternoon tea is a good option. However don’t expect the full ‚value for money‘ - but who on earth would look for a bargain in such a location...","4","2019-02"
"Burj Al Arab - still the best","Having taken a short break last year that was excellent we did the same again hoping that our experience was standard and not by chance. We were not disappointed - still the same and absolute Quality.","5","2019-02"
"great property needing an upgrade in service","great property, greatly cleaned and maintained, great luxury, spacious rooms, not so great service, not so great buffets, overly crowed in common areas, important to see and stay but sadly does not make egor to return. can't understand why as it has absolutely everything to be perfect ","4","2019-02"
"Bucket list hotel","Stayed with family in 2 rooms. Overall staff, rooms and hotel in general were excellent however rooms are just slightly dated. In room dining table service very good. Check in was a bit confused at first however nothing too major. Check out performed on the room level and was fast and efficient. Nice touches with confectionary cart for kids on room arrival. Not exactly value for money, but this is more of a bucket list hotel for me rather than a hotel I would stay at every time I'm in Dubai.","5","2019-02"
"Still special .","Still a great hotel, nothing has changed since my last stay.

"Amazing 5 star hotel","We stayed in Burj al Arab with our 10 year old son in Feb -19. The hotel looks amazing and has only suits. We got a suite on the 10:th floor with sunset view and views overlooking the palm. They say it’s a 7 star hotel but it’s really not, it’s a nice 5 star hotel. You get a number to a butler who helps you with everything, nice but there are a couple of things need fixing before calling the butler. The wifi in the hotel is not good, not in the rooms or pool area. A 5 star hotel needs to have exellent wifi 2019!
I had 3 conference calls crashing.
Supernice staff all over, really helpful and nice!
The gym is ok, a bit run down for a 7 star hotel but ok.
Great pool area with 2 heated jacuzzis beside the large i finity pool, great in february when some days can be a little colder.
The whole hotel looks amazing standing on a small man made island in the ocean. It’s almost sureal looking down on the beaches and the oalm from your suite.
Overall a fantastic stay!","4","2019-02"

The rooms are unparalleled, we stayed in a panoramic suite—the price difference was worth it, we had an unbelievable view of Dubai. Our butler, Paul, was amazing. I’d often come home to find my clothes folded, makeup organized and bed made beautifully. It was a dream. 

Breakfast in the room is amazing and included. We also often dined for breakfast at scape by the pool, which was delicious. Every restaurant in this hotel was worth visiting. We dined at Nathan Outlaw’s and Al Iwan and had afternoon tea at Al Muntaha (request a window seat specifically for a fee). They prepared small chocolate and rose surprises for us at every place as we were celebrating our honeymoon. There was one 24/7 concierge person per floor (something like 10-20 rooms per floor I’d estimate) plus an assigned Butler per room so as you can imagine service was unbelievable. 

Only one complaint—tour groups are permitted to tour the property and sometimes saturate the entire lobby. One stepped in front of our window during tea close enough that she was pushing up against our table and blocking our view and began snapping photos (she was ultimately redirected by staff). I think the hotel would be better served by limiting the size of tour groups as it detracts from the ambiance.","5","2018-04"
"Service ","I always make big bookings with Burj Al Arab and spent lots of money on this booking. The customer service is bad. There is no one who assist guests. I asked for an invoice and they gave a manual invoice, not the proper or official invoice. ","1","2019-02"
"Excellent Service","I would stay this hotel again if I visiting Dubai, all employee are very professional to serve our inquiry, making you feel you are at home, also all amenity provided in room are top quality & brand name.","5","2019-01"
"Over rated","Many other hotels in Dubai are much better than Burj Al Arab. I think this hotel is overrated. It is a bit an old hotel.
To be inside is exclusive and they do make you feel special. The hotel is luxurious and expensive. I still it worth visiting it.","3","2019-02"
"Father and sons' weekend break","Service was second to none as you can expect. Special thanks to our butler Larry and guest relation manager Simona who were always ready to help us and fulfill our needs. We had a dinner with the kids at Nathan Outlaw restaurant which was nice experience for the kids due to the huge aquarium in the middle of the restaurant. Kids menu was a disappointment and kid's portions were  highly overpriced and very far from the quality you could expect. ","5","2019-02"
"Amazing Hotel","Stayed for two nights at Burj Al Arab and had fantastic out of the world experience. Everything from check in to all the room amenities and check out was great. Will recommend strongly to at least experience once.","5","2019-01"
"Disappointing at some areas, while at the same time remarkable at any other areas","We had check in issues on arrival date, check in process was very very slow and not welcoming, i work in a hotel as a reception and i know how to welcome my guest on their arrival.While our buttle Ms Febri and 1 male buttle were very excellent, we had a good talk, febri went up to the skyview bar with us to ensure our reservation is through, spa team also were great, i had treatment with Brad, he was very informative","4","2019-01"
"Burj Al Arab is FAULTLESS","Myself and my wife stayed at the Burj for her Birthday. From the time of being picked up by Rolls Royce to leaving the hotel after our stay the hotel and all the staff and amenities were top class. Without a doubt, The Best Hotel in The World.","5","2019-01"
"its just ok","the room which i stayed in was not ok because the apperiance of the room from the enterance is bad . once you enterd the room you will face the stairs wich covers the living room . you feel like its very small place. i didnt like it at all . ","3","2019-01"
"Standing tall for 20 years","It had been quite a few years since I last stayed at the Burj al Arab and it is hard to believe that the hotel is turning 20 years later this year.

I remember the duplex suites, the large jacuzzis in the bathroom and the Hermes amenities. And there they all were - still/again.
Each floor is serviced by one butler who, depending on the floor, has to look after 2-14 suites. Up to the 15th floor, where the deluxe and panoramic suites are located, the floors are identical and house two panoramic and twelve deluxe suites. As the structure narrows upwards, the floors have less and less suites, culminating in the 25th floor which only houses two royal suites. 
The butler son my floor all spoke German, English and another language. I eventually asked whether they were allocated to floors depending on guests’ nationalities, which seemed to be the case.
The decor is very golden. My personal preference is the swimming pool in the spa, which features slightly less gold and more wooden accents.
An addition as compared to my last stay was the large outdoor pool area and terrace, which have been added in 2017.
As I was visiting during the cold season, during which temperatures stay below 30 degrees Celsius. In these temperatures the pool facility is great. For the warmer periods there are air-conditioned cabanas available for rent in standard, luxury and royal versions.
Given the moderate temperatures there was no need to hire one and I enjoyed the pool from the sand beach right next to it.

I enjoyed breakfast and dinner buffet-style in BAB al Yam, as well as Friday Brunch at Al Muntaha and dinner at Nathan Outlaw. One night I visited Gold on 27, which is smoking and the other Skyview Bar, which is min-smoking. All experiences were accompanied by friendly and efficient service. 
Despite having to make multiple adjustments to my bookings the butler managed all alterations perfectly.
Twenty years in Burj al Arab is still worth a visit. I bet there will be a grand celebration for the anniversary that is not to be missed.
","5","2019-01"
"The service is amazing ","The decor is not my style. I like modern. However the service and helipad are making this place top notch and unbelievable experience. The presidential suit is very big with a spectacular view and gold bathrooms(not my thing) but unique. It is different level experience. ","5","2018-12"
"Everything was Perfect","The hotel - start to finish - was perfect in every way.  We hired one of their cars to pick us up and the service was so easy!  We were greeted at the hotel by someone who took us through the hotel, to our floor and handled the check in from our suite. He also gave us exactly what we needed to get our day started and made our dinner reservation. The room is not to be believed. Some people have said it’s a bit run down but I could not find a single thing wrong (I was looking).  The suite is a bit over the top for my taste but I’d truly beautiful!!!  And the bed!  I literally tore it apart to figure out where the bed and linens were from. (There is a small pamphlet that gives you all of this info so no need to tear it apart!). We slept like the dead.  The pool is amazing!  The further pool is 80 meters end to end (perfect for swimming laps) and has large, beautiful jacuzzis at either end. The closer pool has a large bar for drinks. There is also a beach between the two pools with about 100 lounges. Overall, this hotel is gorgeous and perfect in every single way. Just. Perfect. ","5","2019-01"
"Mind Blowing property ","Stayed there with my son on his vacations , No words can describe the property it’s a Man made heaven on earth .

The Suite Rooms r duplex’s where every corner of the room has something unique from the in room bar , view from the room , the bed , the washroom the amenities (Hermes). This room makes u feel like a king .

The staff is extraordinary in terms of service I would like to thank Ashley , Raman , Tushar & Samir for being so good they were outstanding in every aspect .

The check inn is an experience from the time u get into the hotel till they drop to u your room every thing which they explain u about the hotel is out of This world .

The indoor swimming pool is Master piece of art , the hotel has an access to the beaches where u can spend quality time during the day time .

The Wild Wadi park access is free for the hotels guest where u have great fun with your kids during the day .

The hotel cart takes u around the hotel , they can drop u to a point where u can take a ferry which takes u around the jumeirah there r so many high end restaurants around where u can spend your evening .

The rooftop bar is the place to be if u r looking for amazing evening.

It’s a dream place to be I liked every minute which I spend in the property .

Would love to visit this man made heaven every time I m in Dubai .","5","2018-06"
"archaic","Now i understand why the hotel is one of the most archaic landmarks of dubai,my family and i enjoyed every outlet and we were fascinated by everything! The people,the service and the food are incompatible with any other","5","2019-01"
"Legend in faded shadow of the glory from past .","When i compare this hotel with all new hotels wich been builded in last few years is Burj Al Arab is now less than average .

And what irritated me so much were all guide tours which been here from morning to evening , and i felt here as i been fish in aquarium . Is pity that overloaded of glory is destroing this unique place .   

People/butler who cares about your comfort , are completly opposite  , when you need them there are not there , but when you want not be disturbed you have to answear on stupid courtesy questions !    

Spa , in my view is small . And treatments been less than average , i almost break off a massage , i expected something much much more better , on street anywhere else is a massage better !    

Food been also average like somewhere in mass resorts !

What is awesome is new deck behind of hotel , this place is something different . But it is only one drop of clear water in glass of dirty water . 

 
This hotel need a massive reconstruction immediately !","2","2019-01"
"Stunning views","Great experience I really enjoy the service here at the hotel room with a great experience but very pricey. I will come back here for leisure experience if hotel prices are great value for money for residents.","5","2019-01"

"Magnificent ","One of the magnificent buildings in UAE. Situated right on the beach with a view of city and sea. Access is limited you need to take a taxi to reach. Beach is beautiful and windi in this season. Carrying something warm is better.","5","2019-01"
"Luxury at its Best","Went to Burj Al Arab for breakfast, it's a great way to explore/visit the Burj Al Arab. You can easily book it by calling the hotel. The hotel is like a big Sail on water. It's the luxury at its best and you can experience it. Definitely must visit place when you in Dubai . You can also book high tea experience. Great place to visit","5","2018-04"
"World’s Greatest-Perfection","This hotel was nothing short of perfection. An experience like no where else in the world, the food the service, the staff and everything in between was beyond incredible!

"Above and beyond","Our stay at the Burj Al Arab was absolutely amazing- from the hotel, the room, the pool and facilities to the helpful and very friendly staff. If you come to UAE you need to stay even for just one night to experience what this hotel has to offer- It will go above and beyond your highest expectations.","5","2018-12"
"Once in a life time experience","The hotel is superb and well endowed. Its facilities are indeed top of the range and well maintained.I would recommend friends anytime to go and experience Burj Al Arab once in their life time.RegardsSunil","5","2019-01"
"Out of this world","If there is one place in your lifetime you need to visit, this is the one (In terms of a hotel visit).
From the moment your car door is opened at the hotel entrance you are greeted by luxury and the warmest welcome
Possible!
It’s hard to even put into words how breath taking the architecture and elegance of this iconic hotel actually is in real life-simple astonishing.
There is no hiding from the fact that it will
Cost you an arm and a leg but every penny is worth it!
If I had one negative, it would be to avoid room service, the service was fantastic but the food is average-not what you would expect from a 7 star hotel (cardboard pizza and basic chicken burger was consumed...disappointing) but this no way affected our wonderful stay.

"When is a 7-star not a 7-star?","Caveat: Let me start by saying I didn't stay at this hotel so my experience is only based on my short visit.

My friends and I decided to have morning breakfast at the Burj Al Arab. When we arrived we were promptly welcomed. Walking into the building and we were instantly hit by the scale of the building which was impressive and confirmed our thoughts that this was a true architectural masterpiece.  We initially walked around and explored the interior of the hotel to see the internal fountains and the large atrium. It was then we stumbled onto the restaurant where we were to have our breakfast. I say stumbled as initially, we thought it was just a part of the extended lobby.  This ""restaurant"" only had limited tables at dining height which were only available at the window view so we had to be seated in a coffee table seating area.  The waitress was apologetic, polite and very attentive as she explained the menu to us.  We ordered different set breakfast menus to get a sense of what was on offer.

When the food arrived we were all very underwhelmed - everything that was served seemed very basic and generic in its presentation, execution, and flavour. There was no flair or wow factor. I'm not one for the “wow” experience, but I do expect something more. In the words of a previous reviewer, ""you can find this in any 4-star hotel"". Let me note this breakfast wasn't cheap and was marketed as an 'experience'.  

I got a sense that the hotel offered the minimum possible to those who want to visit the Burj Al Arab. I say this because the breakfast location lacked atmosphere or suitable seating with real dining tables. The menu offered a was a little bland - the type of things you could find in any bakery or cafe. They are seriously shortchanging guests here. You're basically paying to enter the building and food just a pretext or an afterthought.

So, in summary, we didn't expect to be sitting in a lobby type area, squatting over a coffee table trying to eat breakfast, which is basically pastries, cheeses and an omelette. This isn't what I would call an ""experience"". This hotel proclaims to be a 7-star hotel. However, I've been to many 4 and 5-star hotels where I have enjoyed a better premium experience - this wasn't even close.

After our meal, we walked around some more to view the exterior of the building and I learnt to appreciate the building even more and I was glad I did as it made my visit worthwhile. Unfortunately, the interior from design and decorations looked very dated, worn and a little booshie for my liking. I think at the time the philosophy was, go big and brash or go home. I think its time for a revamp.

My impression from the hotel and experience is this hotel doesn't live up to its 7-star status and has become complacent and is now coasting on its perceived status and legacy. Unfortunately, there are enough people like myself who love the building so much who are willing to pay to have the experience and opportunity to see this architectural marvel. 

NOTE: I've noticed that the response from the hotel to critics seem to be formulaic, and to highlight any positive points raised, gloss over or ignore any real criticism and then add a generic ""we value your feedback"". I highlight this for a number of reasons because it comes across as insincere and a little lazy. Also, it would be good if they could quantify in real terms how they will address some of the guests' feedback. 

I say this with a view that things are improved or corrected so other guests leave the hotel feeling they'd had an amazing experience, a win for them and the hotel.","3","2018-12"

"ONE OF THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD","The hotel is stunning.  We were staying at 2008, the view was breathtaking.   From enter to the hotel, check-in, go the room, restaurant, pool...etc all of the staff were in a smile and so helpful.   The outdoor infinitely pool is beautiful with great view of the Arabian sea.  This is a family trip to celebrate my mother's Birthday.  They have arranged a surprised birthday cake to my mother with flower & snacks.  Credit to Afsar who is helpful and always to be helped in needed.We have been to Al Iwan for dinner, all the staff are nice & with great smile.  Let you feel like I'm at home...they are providing professional service.  Thank you for Chef George Kniher & his team for the excellent food & service.   Appreciated for their special arrangement for the dinner, my mother likes it very much.","4","2019-01"
"High tea","Managed to have a birthday celebration at the restaurant at this beautiful hotel. High tea at this restaurant above the city of Dubai was amazing. Great views, wonderful food. Champagne was an added bonus. Remember some experiences have to be paid for . Its not cheap but definitely worth the price. Special tip don't eat before the event.","5","2018-09"
"One of the Best hotel in the world","We have stayed many times at the Burj. It is truly one of the best hotels in the world from the rooms, facilities, views and staff.

Now it’s not cheap - probably one of the most expensive hotels in the world as well  - but it is a great experience from start to end, and I am always happy to pay if you get what you paid for.

Highlights 

The new pool area / bar over looking the Arabian Sea is just great 

The rooms are large, beautiful and well appointed 

Hermès products in the room(both men and female) and not just little bottles (full size bottles) 

The gym is just amazing 

The staff are great and really nice  

That  you can go across to the other Jumierah hotels next door (by golf buggy) and also use their wonderful facilities

Access to the Wild Wadii next door water park 

It was our wedding anniversary while we were there and they made us a wonderful (complimentary) chocolate cake for us with champagne ..

All up excellent experience","5","2019-01"
"The concept is just amazing and it works","Transportation is always a problem until you feel comfortable and understand the nuisances then you are comfortable. Understand customs and be aware of these to avoid offending others. Fast and reliable taxis available and the drivers are more than willing to do that little extra to ensure you have a good time","4","2018-11"
"Dubai paradise called Burj Al Arab","5 days of paradise, we felt like royalties. Perfect outside and inside pools, perfect service, excellent Hermes cosmetics in bathroom and in the pool showers.  Food, cocktails, beaches, fun. Every day new surprise for children was waiting in the room service. Personal butler helps you with everything 24/7.","5","2019-01"
"definitely and amazingly 7-stars hotel","The hotel is breathtaking and stunning.  Last year, we went to the 27TH floor skyview bar for an afternoon tea and this year we stayed in the amazing suite. Without hesitation, the hotel deserves the 7stars either for the design, the view, the room, the experience or the service. Being in our suite was an earthly heaven, the indoor talise pool is terrific! the terrace infinity pool with a full view on the Arabian sea horizon is just g.r.e.a.t. Our efficient buttler Mr ANTHONY made our stay memorable: a very kind, helpful and professional man. He demonstrated @the same time a high level of professionalism and commitment to his job as well as the right connection and emotional bound with the guests who never felt away from home. We wish him the best for his future career. As for the other staff, they are polite and professional but no much sign of empathy and warm welcoming like in other high-rated hotels in Dubai, Abu dhabi or Oman. Warm hello to the whole team of the Junsui restaurant! Humanly kind and welcoming! dishes are delicious and correspond to our taste and desire for Asian cuisine!  
As a whole, our stay in Burj Al Arab was a memorable one and we’ll definitely come back and we recommend the hotel to all those in quest of an original and luxurious stay.","5","2019-01"
"Burj Again","Celebrating my daughters birthday - we visited Burj Al Arab for the third time.If you are looking for luxury, a perfect day on the ""beach"" and some very good asian food-then there is no better place on earth.","5","2019-01"
"The glory days are over","My second stay to Burj Al Arab and unfortunately nothing had changed, the hotel needs a face lift to survive. Service is excellent but other than that hardware and interior is way out of date. I really hope that managment takes action and realise the situation to save their reputation.","3","2019-01"
"Best of the Best","The most amazing break. 
This hotel is breathtaking and the best part is the incredible staff too. 

Whilst it’s luxury is unsurpassed it does it in a very personal and friendly way.
Mercy, Merwyn and Zaheer our butlers were incredibly good. 

The restaurant with the aquarium is incredible and the service absolutely first class. Suite WiFi needs speeding up but apart from this I can’t fault this 7 star palace it’s immaculate, the pool Is incredible and since my last visit the staff and service is perfect. Definitely going back. Best hotel in the world without question.","5","2019-01"
"Best Christmas Ever!","We were looked after like royalty, from the minute we arrived, we travelled as a family of 5 and spent Christmas at this wonderful hotel.  It is not our first visit but every visit gets better.  Our suite was stunning and the views outstanding, the Christmas decorations were beautiful throughout the suite and hotel. Christmas Eve we all rode a camel and Father Christmas visited the children.  This hotel is the best in the world we have visited and it just keeps improving, the staff, the food, the deck, cabanas, pools, all amazing and very spoiling.  Thank you everyone.","5","2018-12"

"Awesome ","It’s a great property. Honestly it’s super commercialized which kind of doesn’t go well with its value. Not to mention that people without booking are not allowed which is kind of shewed in the present world. This was just the feedback for one less star. Otherwise an excellent property.","4","2019-01"
"Amazing visit !","Thank you to all the staff for their friendly and exceptional service. Truly an amazing experience. We would especially like to thank VIP doctor, Dr. Ahmad El-Neklawi for being available and so attentive to our needs at such a last minute. VIP doctor helped our son during an emergency and it was extremely helpful during our vacation and allowed us to have peace of mind and still enjoy our vacation. The entire team was so patient and understanding. ","5","2018-08"
"Amzing Coctails at Gold on 27 at the Burj Al Arab","My mother in law was visiting along with my Daughter on partner, for a Christmas treat we booked a cocktail evening at the Gold on 27 bar on the 27th floor of the Burj Al Arab. We had the most amazing views and fantastic cocktails with fake snow and dry ice. You have to spend a minimum of 150 AED per head and you have to book but it was a great night out and something just a little special in one of the worlds most iconic buildings and also one of just a handful of 7 star hotels. The reason I did not give it 5 stars was that they allow smoking in the bar which as a non-smoker did not appreciate, however still a great experience one to be taken if you are ever in Dubai.","4","2019-01"
"Excellent hotel","The hotel is really the best place in Dubai and all was very friendly there. Also its good to know that many restaurants also around the hotel (Jumeirah area) ...and if you say that you are from Burj you have on Jumeirah unlimited access ...Also the waterpark our kids enjoy and the hotel themself have an unbelievable impression! Very clean - very beautiful - and the new pool area is also very good and safe!","5","2018-12"

We loved our Panorama Room - our first time in this category!  We are so grateful to so many wonderful staff members who helped make our stay very special!!!Thank you to our World Class Butler Team:  Afsar, Aldrin, Esmet, Aziz, Issa, Lili, and Team!

"One of the best Hotels in the World","A very good hotel, quality everything, massive rooms and lots of helpful staff that are very attentive. We have been several times as a couple and then as a family and definitely recommend it, by far the best hotel in Dubai, probably a better experience for couples than families as it is a bit special.  Its expensive though","5","2018-12"

"My 3 night stay","Back in 2010 my wife, daughter and i visited Dubai for the first time. During the trip and at a loose end, we booked afternoon tea at the burj which was superb but very expensive. Fast forward to 2018 and to celebrate my 60th I took my daughter to Dubai for 8 nights spending the first 5 nights in the Pearl Marina Apartments and as a treat the last 3 nights in the Burj al Arab. 
I booked the Burj 8 months in advance and paid around £900 per night for the cheapest suit ( the 5 nights in the Pearl Marina totalled £450 ! ) The Burj experience starts when your taxi pulls up to the private bridge and they take your reservation details. By the time you have crossed the bridge and the taxi pulls up to the reception area there is a reception committee waiting for you with cold towels and welcoming drinks, before you have even checked in. Another member of staff thenescorts you past the selfie seeking tourists past the 200 ft high fountain into the lift and up the check in desk on your floor ( each floor had one ) where you meet your concierge and butler who escorts you to your suite. The suite made us both gasp, a duplex room in gold and marble with sweeping views over the sea back to the city.
Because my daughter is 17 I requested a sofa bed to be set up in the living area and I had the bedroom upstairs. Her sofa bed was a real bed and the living area was so big her bed didn’t look out of place. Once settled in the butler knocked on door carrying  a plate of canapés a cake and a bottle of fiz as a complimentary gift. Breakfast was Included in the price, so after a nights sleep in the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, we went to the main breakfast restaurant which offer every conceivable type of breakfast ranging from American,English,Asian,European. The choices were eye watering. After breakfast we explored the pool area (3 pools) a further breakfast restaurant, bar and the famous pool side cabana’s which are for the seriously rich guests.
We spent a lot of time in the pool area and there was a guilty pleasure in watching some of the day trippers who had made it through the hotel and out to pools being politely escorted back out being told this area was for hotel guests only.
On the 2nd night after a long hot day in the Malls and after my daughter had turned in for the night I took a wander up to the famous Gold Bar on the top floor of the hotel. To gain access you have to produce your suite key, When I got to the bar I was asked by name ( freaky ) whether I wished to stand at the bar or sit by the panoramic windows and enjoy the view which I thought was slightly odd. I chose the view option and as I was sat at my table 
a waiter came over, I thought to take my order, however he was carrying a Tray with a large glass smoking with dry ice and informed me that because I was celebrating a big birthday please accept the cocktail as compliments of the Burj. The surprising thing is that I hadn’t told anyone it was my birthday.
To sum up - it will take me another few years to save up to go back to the Burj but I will and it deserves all the plaudits it gets.","5","2018-08"
"The most luxurious Hotel in the world!","Hands down, this hotel experience was the best ever.  Really, way over the top, literally treated like a King, or a Sheik, this being Dubai.  The suite was expansive and had every amenity possible, the staff waited on our every need and anticipated everything we might want.  Wish I could give it a higher rating than 5 to do it justice!","5","2018-12"
"A special Christmas Day ","Enjoyed a surprise Christmas Day brunch with a beautiful spread of all kinds of food from salads to seafood to sushi, Arabic, carvery, cheeses, desserts and delicacies that are tough to describe in words topped off with some delicious champagne. 
A very nice treat to receive a cake for a special anniversary ","5","2018-12"
"Worth the expense","We were in Dubai for 10 days and spent 3 nights at the Burj al Arab. Over the top? Absolutely. Memories that will last a lifetime? Without a doubt. The hotel is without a doubt the most opulent we have stayed at anywhere, and we have stayed at many a great hotel.","5","2018-02"
"Worth every single penny!!! ","Stayed here a week planned to see all of the beautiful city of Dubai 
Planned to go see the worlds tallest building planned to go and see the new Louvre Museum and all he indoor ski hill

"Amazing Hotel... WOWWW","Burj Al Arab Jumeirah is very amazing Hotel in the world. If you come and stay to this hotel, then you will find many things that might not be thought of by your mind. Very recommend hotel if you come to Dubai.","5","2018-04"
"Amazing hotel.","Perfect in every respect. Wonderful hotel, amazing panoramic suites, exellent restaurants and services. This is a  place where you can feel special. I honestly recommend it :). I hope I will come back here one day. ","5","2018-12"
"Magnificent.","I have been inside on a previous visit for afternoon tea which was so extra special to do and see the inside. This time I wished to capture the magnificent exterior elevations. The architect did not let me down as the building graces the skyline.","5","2018-12"
"Burj Al Arab","Amazing experience. Can't explain how amazing this place is, it is definitely an experience to do once in your life. Next time I come to dubai I will definitely do it again and I Will recomend it to my friends.","5","2018-12"
"luxury experience but cannot sleep well....","TV inside the sleeping area suddenly switched on at around 2am, the remote control was on the table far away from bed. I still do not now why this happened... those big mirrors downstairs are full of dusts (I have pictures to prove), other areas are clean.almost every staff I met are polite, greet with smile, attentive and very helpful.","3","2018-12"
"Memories created for life","There are places that set the definition of word 'excellent' and can be used as synonym; BAA is easily one of them standing tall since years together. Your experience starts with personalised greetings from the moment you step out of your transport. We were escorted inside by a pleasant lady Valleria who greeted us with traditinal drink and dates. Our request for early check in was well received and as if the whole staff knew we were celebrating our anniversay as greetings came from each one supposed to attend to us. We were straight taken to our suite which was opulent with careful aesthetic detailing and mesmerising veiw of city, open sea and terrace infinity pool. We were given check in facility from the comfort of our room.All amenities were of high quality and taste and were arraged both for 'him' and 'her'. A fruit platter, welcome drink , sparkling dates drink were all prepared for our arrival. They have an impressive tea/coffee cabinet and quality mineral water available in room.Bed is very cosy with a full menu for pillows. Dinner and breakfast has great spread and staff makes sure individual needs are taken care off. Our room was decorated by our butler Saleh with rose petals when we reached after dinner with a delicious cake waiting at bar counter. That was a goosebump moment for both of us.Outdoor pool is one of the best i have been to  (the only other comes at par is infinity pool of Marina bay sands in Singapore). Indoor pool at 18th floor is cosy and has steam and sauna attached to it. A very attentive staff is always available to provide you necessary amenities and also will dry your swimwear for next use in 2 minutes. Library, pool table, kids club are all of high quality.The staff is well trained to create a memorable experience for you and would try to deliver more than what you accept. The bagghi driver Gaffar had to give a ride to beach but voluntarily offered to take us through all connected Jumeirah properties for mini tour. We reached BAA happy and left happiest with memories created for life.","5","2018-12"
"Memorable time in shot time","It was amazing time staying with you lovely staff nd good food... all over was vry good experience. I will come back with my family soon thank you for the hospatilaty  and special thank to chef for the food","4","2018-08"
"Wonderful Birthday Cabana Celebrations!!","We booked a Cabana for my birthday day at the BAA poolside this is the second year we have done this however this year we mentioned it was my Birthday celebrations and Wow they really made it a special day to remember from balloons and fresh fruit in the cabana to a wonderful bouquet of Roses and a cake with a happy birthday song by the staff poolside. Thank you so much Thierry, and everyone else who made it a memorable birthday! 
Even if you aren’t celebrating a special day this is certainly not to be missed if you are looking for a day of luxury and relaxation with attentive staff in a first class location make sure you book a cabana at the Burj al Arab! you will not regret it!!!!","5","2018-12"
"One night worth a thousand nights","I have stayed more than 2000 room nights in my life I can tell you this hotel is by far a different calibre and experience value for money I think I it's cheap you get way more than you pay I won't talk more so as not to spoil the surprises for you","5","2018-12"
"My mom's birthday","I gave a very short notice to Lota about my mom's BD when I walked in to the lounge. My request was to have ""Happy birthday!"" on my mom's plate, but she came with a birthday cake and a rose. Honestly I did not expect this. Later Ahmed came with another rose for me and a BD card for my mom. Had an amazing time with my mom here in Sahn Eddar lobby lounge. They took many photos for us as well. Staffs are very attentive and have genuine smile.","5","2018-12"
"Outstanding experience","We visited the Burj-Al-Arab to enjoy a nice breakfast and get to know the hotel during our stay in Dubai for my wife's birthday. From a wide range of breakfast menus we chose the continental one and was a very good choice with quality ingredients. The highest point of this experience was the wonderful service of btbhe entire staff team specially Ahmzd and Leta who gave my wife a surprise rosa and cake before leaving. Special thanks to them.","5","2018-12"
"Champagne afternoon tea","My partner and I visited in January this year. I had pre-booked afternoon tea before we travelled. My partner was keen on the idea as he thought it was expensive for sandwiches as cake however he soon changed his mind! To start we had prawn cocktail then a warm individual quiche followed by lemon sorbet the the tower of sandwich’s arrived. They then offered more sandwiches followed by a three tier cake stand full of cakes! We were unable to finish everything so the boxes the rest up for us to take away! Unlimited coffee/tea was also included. We also had a few glasses of champagne.
A very relaxed atmosphere, with Devine food and amazing views, definitely recommend! ","5","2018-01"
"Blown away. ","I can’t speak more highly about our stay at the Burj al Arab, It’s a special place. We love the hotel and we’ll definitely be back. The whole place is amazing, and the customer service is second to none. 
A very minor point is that the WiFi isn’t very good but you do have a mac on hand. 
Everyone who stays should definitely spend some time in the spa. 
It’s my favourite hotel. An absolute must. It’s sooooo good. ","5","2018-12"
"Royal Treasures","Everything went well. Hotel staff was professional and friendly. Each floor had its own butler.

"Wow! Stunning Hotel with 7 Star Staff.","We stayed here in early December 2018 and did not want to leave! . We smiled from the moment we entered to the moment we sadly had to leave.
Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff which are a real credit to this hotel. The hotel itself is everything you expect to be - it’s quite simply stunning. 
Our room on the 9th floor had a fantastic views , it was sheer luxury.
Thank you to all of the staff that made our stay very very special.","5","2018-12"
"Birthday Treat","We have been to Dubai on several occasions, but not for nearly ten years , we have never stayed at this hotel , on our arrival we were met by our personal assistant who showed us straight to our room the room was amazing private bar down stairs lounge tv toilet , then large staircase to open bedroom with another small mini bar large bathroom . Pool area and outside bar amazing, breakfast setting amazing, the service is the best we have ever had , great choice of restaurants inside and out , as you may have guessed it's one of the best if not the best hotel in the world , if you have the opportunity to visit or even stay here you must , also afternoon tea is another experience must book well in advance but well worth a try .","5","2018-12"
"A must visit (but probably only once!) ","The most opulent place I’ve ever been... had an afternoon tea with cocktails and paid extra for a window seat (even though I hate heights and wow! The sky bar is high) but the view over the palm is not to be missed. A lovely one off treat but slightly over the top for my taste. ","4","2018-05"
"great experience","A great experience for tourism, the food is good but still needs to be improved. very warm and friendly and free water activities are awesome. of course the price is not cheap but worth of experiencing ","5","2018-12"
"7 Star experience","In 2017 Burj Al Arab added the pool area and the infinity pool to their premises. Tried many 5 star hotels and pool areas around the world. This is the best one so far.  Service is impeccable, down to earth but professional. They understand service without being snobbish. Expensive hotel - yes. One for a bucket list indeed, but they also deliver a plus plus experience . ","5","2018-12"
"A wonderful hotel with beautiful location","We only went to this place for dinner with local friends from Dubai. It has an amazing view.

"Great Staycation","Great service, really family friendly and a personal service. Good quality hotel products and not too busy at the time we went. Executive pool was great and use of all madinat jumeirah facilities was excellent. ","5","2018-11"
"Amazing again","We were lucky enough to stop at the burj again and it was fantastic from the minute we arrived. Our arrival was at 8.30nin the morning but our room was ready we were greeted by Alam our butler who could not do enough for us throughout our stay. He was so professional there to advise when needed and helpful in every way. He was assisted by Rosanne who was charming at all times. We met an amazing lady in the Asian breakfast room , sorry I have forgotten her name she was from indionesea and made us so welcome if a 7 star hotel existed this would be it don't hesitate to book this experience of a lifetime","5","2018-12"
"Life time experience","If someone likes to stay in a hotel In Dubai Burj al Arab should be the first option at least once because this is a life time experience every one should do. We had been in many 5 star hotels including Dorchester London and Ashfort Castle in Ireland but Burj al Khalifa won.","5","2018-12"
"One of the most impressive places in Dubai","Everything is this hotel is impressive! The different restaurants, the views, the Talise SPA and it's interior infinity pool. One thing that very few people know is that the hotel has a designated turtle hospital that has released more than 1000 rescued sea turtles back into the Arabian Gulf.","5","2018-07"
"The best hotel experience in my life","I spent my birthday at the Burj Al Arab and it was one of the best birthdays in my 45 years of living.  The property is so amazing.  The staff were the most professional people I have ever seen in the hospitality business.  The restaurants, bars, pools, and stores are all top notch amenities you could ever see in a hotel.  Every staff I passed knew my name without me having to tell them.  I will definitely be staying there again.","5","2018-10"
"Outlandish luxury","Fantastic from the moment you pull up. Check in seamless. Made to feel like royalty from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. The suites are stunning and the Hermes toiletries are a nice touch. The pool/beach area is stunning and the cocktails sublime. A special mention has to goto our Butler Alam on the 13th floor who made us feel like he was there only for us and went above and beyond to make sure every request we had was catered for. Positives1. Staff are exceptional. Go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed.2. Suites are stunning. Probably THE best hotel room we have stayed in around the world. Certainly Dubai.3. The unique feeling the Burj gives you. Can’t explain. Just go to see what I mean.Negatives. 1. WiFi was awful. Had to get the maintence guy out a few times and still couldn’t fix it.2. No premium film service. Just normal TV with most channels in Arabic which I found bizarre.3. The bed was way too soft. Both my wife and I got bad backs from it. This would also be something that needed to be addressed if we were ever going to stay for longer than 3 nights. ","5","2018-11"
"High tea ","What an amazing experience , we visited to celebrate my 50th birthday 🎂 
We had to cancel our plans for when my birthday was in April as my husband was ill.
We watched this hotel being build in 1996 so always wanted to visit
An amazing time had by us both , well worth every penny

"Amazing Security Staff","By far the best hotel experience I have ever had! Definitely 7 stars! I went to the restaurant Junsui and I had a hole in the back of my dress (very embarrassing spot) and I stepped out of the elevator and saw Janet Security and asked if the hotel had a seamstress or needle and thread, and she immediately went in to action and went and tracked down a needle and thread! The most amazing part is she even sewed the entire hole up for me in the wash room!! She is so amazing and this is the most spectacular hotel I have ever been to! I’d give it 8 stars if I could!","5","2018-11"
"Proper Afternoon Tea","Went for the afternoon tea package (with window table).
Absolutely fabulous - service: second to none, food: incredible, views: unbelievable.
The tea session (which includes a glass of champagne) lasts for 2 hours so very relaxed atmosphere and no pressure whatsoever.
The presentation of the food is straight out of a quality English tea room.
The restaurant (and the rest of the building) is immaculate.
Not cheap but worth every dirham.","5","2018-11"

"Outstanding location","Expensive, but worth every euro. The reception by the butler was extremely friendly he explained the suite in all details and all the wishes we had were fulfilled immediately. The Burj al Arab is still one of the best hotel we have stayed in. We will definitely return on our next visit to Dubai. The two pools are outstanding and the service goes on with cooled towels and a cooling bag for your drinks. Nothing else to mention you must experience it by yourself.","5","2018-10"

"Luxury at its best","Amazing hotel and location. If you are considering it, just booking do it! The two pools are amazing. One is fresh water and the other is salt water. They are in the back of the property. The hotel is an engineering masterpiece and it’s hard to believe it is almost 20 yearst old. ","5","2018-11"

"Burj Al Arab earned its ""7stars"".  It simply is the best hotel we have ever stayed at - Anywhere!","We arrived in Dubai to connect to a flight to Africa and figured we would stay several days to explore. We were very fortunate to learn of the hotel Burj Al Arab. When my travel agent told me it was the only 7 star hotel in the world I told her we had to stay there.  We are so impressed in so many ways.  The experience we have had at this hotel from the moment we arrived has been nothing short of extraordinary. The hotel is located on a man-made island just off the coast. You go through security and then over a small bridge to gain access. When you pass through security they check your name and reservation. That information is forwarded to all personnel who you will encounter in the next 15 minutes, from the doorman, the bellman, the person escorting you through the hotel to your floor and then to the butler on your floor who is stationed just off the elevator area. The butler along with you escort, take you to your room where the entire check in process, which is extremely abbreviated, is done right in your room at the desk located near the door.  Very efficient.  There is no “reception desk”.  The room we booked was 1 step above the basic room - with an enhanced panoramic view. The room is absolutely incredible!!  It is two stories. There is a winding staircase as you walk into the room that takes you up to the incredible bedroom suite. Downstairs, there is a dining area, a bar, a large living room and powder room.  A large bowl of fresh fruit along with 2 boxes of assorted dates, are waiting along with several types of bottled water and a bottle of sparkling wine.  Upstairs there is a very generous size bedroom with a king bed and bathroom with a Jacuzzi and a separate shower.  Everything is extremely elegant.  The bathrooms are stocked with Hermes products.  This includes fresh sealed large boxes of Hermes after shave and cologne for the men and similar products for the women, and it is for you to take with you!!   The bath products are also Hermes and also very large.  I would guess there are $600 of Hermes products in the bathroom for you to enjoy and take with you.

As far as standard hotel rooms go, this is one of the nicest hotel rooms we've ever stayed at anywhere (see the photos but the photos do not come close to doing justice to the room). As far as service, to give you an idea of the level of service at this hotel, when we left the room and was heading for the elevator, three executives from the hotel had come off the elevator about 30 seconds before. One of the executives immediately made a U-turn well before we got to her, and called the elevator so that it was there when we arrived. The same is true for staff in the lobby.  The butlers on the floor cannot do enough for you. They learned we are celebrating an event.  The next night they brought us this incredible custom cake that had each hour on the dial inscribed with words that were relevant to the event we are celebrating.  Also accompanying the cake was a dozen red roses and assorted bottles of liquors. 

Also, one night we were fortunate to have dinner at their famous incredible, not to be missed, seafood restaurant, “Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara” where they continued to impress.  The center core of the restaurant is a 350,000-gallon fish tank with 30 different types of incredible fish.  The ambiance, food and service are all at the top of their game. 
I cannot remember any restaurant that i have been to to have the perfect trifecta - they do!  More on this very fine seafood establishment in a separate post.  All I will say is the price matches the service and food.  Don’t come here if you are on a budget.  This is a restaurant for very special occasions or those who do not have a budget.  And it’s worth every dollar!

Like the restaurant Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara, the hotel is not for one in Dubai on a budget. However, how often do you go to Dubai and how often do you get the opportunity to experience a 7-star hotel?  If you looking for the ultimate experience at hotel, this is it. The only problem is when you leave, your future stops will not come close to the experience you will realize at Burj Al Arab.","5","2018-09"
"35th Anniversary Stay","My wife and I stayed there recently to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary. It was amazing. The hotel is beyond beautiful. It is superbly maintained and the staff are perfect professionals. From the moment we arrived until we got in the car to leave we were spoiled by the staff as they ensured that our anniversary was celebrated and special. Especially Mercy our Butler. She was absolutely a delight and always so sweet, happy and wonderful. Thanks for the great time. See you next year. ","5","2018-11"
"Total Disapointment ","
I really like the architecture building & the size of the room.

List of disappointment.

1) I understand the hotel might want to keep the middle eastern design but it is time for some upgrading to add some modern look. Room looks dated n tired looking ... Unlike the pool side n breakfast area, look modern & nice.

2) Unsure how long the sofas are there. The foam was wore out, when you sit on it, it kind of collasped. Feeling like the two arm chairs were there for decades.

3) check-in: lougue floor or room check-in is good but the whole process can be better

a) invite the guests to sit on the sofa instead of standing at the bar counter. 

b) give a full & detail briefing on the use of equipments in the room 

c) serve the welcome drinks with coaster & serviettes (that's the main 

d) the old style red roses petals on counter top n bath tub area. OMG! 

Lack of attention to detail.

1) wet towels were served when we walked in hotel lobby , next was dates ....but no wet towel was given after. Your sticky fingers can it be washed in the room.

2) no night light in the room.

3) be prepared to walk down stairs to living room if you want a drink because no pantry & mini bar at upper level (bedroom)

4) no pillows menu ?!  

What's good:

1) nice private beach 
2) nice view from room 
3) branded full size toiletries (including eyes cream n perfume)
4) maybe bragging rights

"Definitely worth the experience, very expensive, so be aware","We toured the Burj Al Arab on our Honeymoon. Jumeirah (private) beach is stunning and worth the visit. We had dinner at Al Muntaha, the first 7 star restaurant. The service is impeccable, and the food was great if you love seafood. The portions are french style, so small portions. You do leave with your belly full, so don't worry about that. Again, worth the experience, and the pictures you get are priceless. You get treated like royalty and it is worth the experience. If asked if I would return, I probably would, but if I missed it, I know that I at least had the experience once already. Enjoy :))))","4","2018-11"
"Wow!","What a fantastic property!  The Al Mahara was a fantastic restaurant.  The service was exceptional and a must try is the sea bass roasted in salt.   The decor is a must see! We also stopped for cocktails at the gold 27 club under the helipad.  What a perfect ending for a great day.","5","2018-11"
"Scape Brunch","While the beauty of the hotel and its reputation were beyond my ability to describe, I was truly impressed not only with its location but the sheer magnificence of the engineering and how the esthetic beauty of its architecture were melded into a cohesive, breathtaking visual experience. 

The hotel’s reputation for professionalism, courtesy and respect shown the guests was impressive and remains firmly intact. Memorable, genuine and, of equal importance, remarkable to observe the staff clearly enjoying themselves, their interactions with the guests and the company of their co-workers.
The Cali menu, options and course preparation were superb, well-presented and of course, delicious. Supported by Mr. Stephane  and Ms. Mel, the staff’s efforts were phenomenal in making the entire visit truly a pleasure.
The relaxing and phenomenal view of the Gulf, without question, contributed to the experience tremendously, less we forget the beautiful weather. 
The hotel’s brunch venue has my highest recommendation and endorsement and I extend an invitation to family, friends and co-workers here and in the United States to plan a visit at your earliest opportunity. You will not be disappointed.
Again, a heartfelt THANK YOU to Stephane, Mel and the staff - see you upon my return. ","5","2018-11"
"Must try the Burj Al Arab!","This is a must try experience!  There is nothing that is not perfect!  The grounds, the food, the rooms...it’s an incredible place!   The spa was divine. The outdoor breakfast buffet was extraordinary.  You will feel like royalty. I will definitely return!","5","2018-11"
"Brings new meaning to “Over the Top”","Most gold, jewels, marble bright colors you have ever experienced.  Must be seen to be believed.  However, very expensive so stay only one night and see everything in the hotel.  Service is great, well trained and lovely staff, food is extremely good.  Don’t forget to just sit in the lobby and watch the multicultural parade!","4","2018-11"
"Honeymoon","Stayed there on the final day of our honeymoon. 

Absolutely world class. 

Not much more to be said. 

They checked us in within our room. Gave us a tour of our 2 floor suite. Left some red wine and a huge cake to say congrats. We actually cancelled all our day plans and just spent the day lounging around in pure luxury. Very expensive for what it is , but overall it was well worth it. ","5","2018-08"
"Was an amazing stay","One of my dreams to stay at Burj Al-Arab, and it came true. Luxurious 2 floors bedroom and luxurious furniture. Perfumes, shower gels, and shampoos are amazing. I loved the food, the staff, the ambiance and the service. I would recommend this place to everyone ","5","2018-02"

"Dubai","I love Dubai. A must for anyone who enjoys to travel. Burj Al Arab is  beautiful. You can't get to close unless you are staying or have reservations for tea time or dinner. I recommended making that reservations! ","5","2017-12"
"Ultimate Luxury Stay, A Must If You Can Afford It","We came in to the Burj after being very underwhelmed by a stay at Armani Hotel.  We stayed in a Panoramic suite which is absolutely huge, more like a loft and has a phenomenal view.  The interior has crazy gaudy design that you would likely never choose for your own house so it was great to experience that.  We were very comfortable just lounging in the room enjoying the fantastic view.
The Burj service is obviously top-notch and we got great service from our Butler.  The hotel gym was one of the biggest we have seen, the pool with fantastic view, and all the facilities we tried were excellent.  Great food in the Arabic restaurant and the Indian food we had from room service.
We'd be very happy to come back and stay again, and as I said the hotel is on another level compared to Armani.  Definitely the best city hotel we have ever stayed at.  

Two feedback points for management:  
1.  When we arrived there was a flood of people coming for lunch and taking pictures of the lobby.  No one opened our car door and then when we came in, we were not offered a place to sit because it was so busy.  Maybe you should reserve an area for guests, even if it's just a small place.  Maybe your security could radio ahead when actual hotel guests are coming so you don't assume that people are just coming for lunch.  
2.  The breakfast area is too small so it felt like a school cafeteria with all the people bustling around, lots of noise, and no space.  I understand that the location of the breakfast is very nice, but a second option of a more quiet place would be great for people like us.  There is an ""Asian breakfast"" upstairs but we didn't want that, so expanding the current space or replacing the ""asian breakfast zone"" with a duplicate would be great.","5","2018-10"
"Wonderful stay, great memories","The hotel was one of my bucket list hotels. It was also a birthday gift for my husband. Both of us cherished every moment we had at the hotel. The staff made us feel so welcomed. The Suite was just so luxurious and beautiful. We didn’t want to leave!","5","2018-11"
"Simply Memorable!","My visit to the Sky View Bar was a wonderful birthday surprise booked by my sister from the UK and 'engineered' by my daughter during our visit to Dubai. Afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab really made my day! 
We made our way to the plush foyer where we were elevated to the 27th floor in a matter of seconds. I am not a fan of heights but I barely realised how high we were and was briefly distracted by the spectacular view. That was the smoothest elevator ride I have experienced. We were shown to our table and introduced to Marky, who looked after us throughout our time there. He was very attentive, professional and immediately put us at ease and comfortable. He explained every item on our 7-course afternoon tea menu. Each item was delicate and delicious and there was much more than we could manage. And that wasn't the end - A lovely birthday dessert (with my favourite flavours) presented with a bloom. Meanwhile, the harpist provided beautiful, beautiful music from a broad repotoire! I would like to know if she has a CD? 

We finished off with photographs of The Palm and the surrounding views at dusk.

From our arrival to the time we left we felt very special and I would definitely like to return. Thank you!","5","2018-11"
"Unforgettable experience.","High Tea at Burj Al Arab was absolutely wonderful.  We were treated like royalty the moment we entered this beautiful hotel.  Expensive at about AUD$224 each but worth every penny for the 7 delicious courses including champagne, tea, coffee and cold drinks.  (The passion fruit iced tea was delicious).  We paid approx. AUD $40 extra for a window table which gave us great views all around.  We booked a few months ahead to secure a table but it was not full when we went in Mid October.","5","2018-10"
"no","This is a honeymoon trip.Although the check-out had a small problem, the overall restaurant was great.There was a great place to experience a great place everywhere.I will stay again for a few days next time I arrive in Dubai.","5","2018-10"
"Very exotic design ","Unbelievable hotel that I has ever see the lobby so huge and fantastic . They got the fountain that shoot up very high . The room are very luxury and the service is the feeling very warm while stay in the property ","5","2018-04"
"Burj al arab","It was really nice stay in the hotel. We stayed there for one week and it was lovely. People in hotel were really nice to us. When we arrived to the hotel, Charles was really nice to us. In the first moment i alredy felt welcome. Especially Charles gave us good tips where to shop and where are the nicest places in Dubai. Thank you.","5","2018-10"
"Sky view afternoon tea- out of this world!","My husband and I came to Dubai on our honeymoon 14 years ago and gazed in amazement and awe at the incredible Burj Al Arab, but simply couldn’t afford to go there. 14 years and 2 children later we are back in Dubai for our wedding anniversary and booked afternoon tea as a long awaited treat. From start to finish the whole experience was incredible. The building, interiors, floors, lifts, lights and ceilings are beautiful. What really really makes this place is the staff. Without exception we felt as though we were treated as the perfect combination of both royalty and family. They made our afternoon very special, and so relaxed. Next step is to save up to stay there! Thank you so much to everyone at the Burj for making our 14 year wait worth every second! ","5","2018-11"
"Amazing hotel - Amazing staff - Amazing food","Thank you so much for a perfect holiday - your hotel is fantastic and fautless.
From the minute you arrive to when you leave everything is perfect. The staff are amazing and ensure you have everything you need. The rooms are lovely and the butler is attentive and charming.
The restaurants are superb, the food, the staff and the chefs are all so welcoming and knowledgeble.
We will definately be back and highly recommend your hotel to all our friends and family.
Thanks again

"Luxury treat Cabanna for a day","Whilst we are regular visitors to Dubai, and love the Burj as an iconic and luxurious Hotel, we don't have the resources to stay there unfortunately. As a treat though we have visited for meals and as guests of friends. A cabanna though for a day whilst not cheap , for us is a touch of luxury for a day. You get the usual Burj top quality service and amenities, and can also use the bar and restaurant, which are actually not too over the top , cost wise.
We thoroughly enjoyed our day ( 9.00 am till 7.00 pm ) and would recommend it to anyone who wants a luxury chill out day whilst being treat like a millionaire.","5","2018-10"
"Incredible Stay for Honeymoon","My husband and I spent four nights at the Burj Al Arab in a One Bedroom Panoramic Suite to celebrate our honeymoon and it was worth every penny spent. From the second we arrived, we were greeted with cold towels and dates. Although we arrived six hours before check in, our room was already prepared for our visit with a surprise complimentary breakfast spread. 

The room was well appointed, and while the hotel has a more ""traditional"" feel we felt like everything was beautifully maintained and felt like new. Our room was enormous with a 1.5 bathrooms, a gigantic shower and jacuzzi, walk in closet, and enormous floor to ceiling windows with a view of the sea and the Dubai horizon. The bathroom was stoked with full sized Hermes toiletries.

The grounds of the hotel are also beautiful. If you stay by the pool or the beach you can expect to receive help with towels, umbrella, and a bag filled with water and facial mist. All the restaurants are also exceptional - each one we went to treated us like royalty and were aware we were on our honeymoon. The spa, pool, and gym were also fantastic.

Last but not least - our butler Alam was INCREDIBLE. He went out of his way to familiarize himself with our itinerary, ensured we had everything we needed, and prepared a surprise of rose petals in the bathroom for us one evening. Having his help throughout our stay really set the Burj Al Arab above any other hotel for us.","5","2018-09"
"Afternoon Tea","Absolutely amazing afternoon tea to celebrate my 50th Birthday 
From the moment you step into this gorgeous hotel to leaving we were treated like royalty 
I require gluten free food and they were able to accommodate me and the food was impeccable 

Thank you for the rose and cake, such a lovely gesture ","5","2018-10"
"Contact hotel manager","Our last stay in August was perfect, but there are some things I would like to share with the hotel manager personally, I would like to get in touch with Mr. Scott Murray
I think he’s is still the hotel manager of the Burj al Arab
I try it in this way.

Best regards

"Pure Luxury","The bar is open to all even if you are not a resident. Very opulent hotel with grand lobby and waterfall. The staff treat you like you are a resident. Would recommend a visit for a few drinks and admire the view.","4","2017-11"
"Service of 3 stars hotel","Been here last week 
With expectations of 7 stars hotel which it claimed itself. I couldn’t see anything that made me appreciate about this hotel except the good looking of building and interior design. Other than that are awful especially the service that 
1. Not friendly 
2. Not polite at all
3. No service mind
4. Not even take care the guest
5. Talk to the guest with bad sound

I don’t know that this is how it calls 7 stars. 5 stars hotels are even better than it comparing the service.","1","2018-10"
"Interesting to See but Not Enough to Stay","This building was most unusual with a heliport and two story suites averaging $5,000 per night.  The lobby had cascading waterfalls and fountains.  There were two staircases to the second level on the sides of the water feature.

We were able to walk around before looking at one of the suites.  The suite we saw had three bedrooms and baths, a small kitchen, a bar, a living room and a dining room.  The views were spectacular since the hotel is on the water.  

We found the decor to be too ornate for our tastes with a lot of gold and very bright colors.  We all agreed that we were happy to see it but had no interest in ever returning.","4","2018-10"
"My family had breakfast in Sahneddar","Title: The best breakfast in Sahn Eddar 

My Family and I had breakfast in Sahneddar very relaxing place nice view and Delicious food and what made our experience special is that we get excellent and professional service from Ahmed and Lota, they are both very knowledgeable about Hotel and food. We definitely come back next time.","5","2018-10"
"Great Time at Sahn Eddar Burj Al Arab Dubai","My husband and I had breakfast at Sahn Eddar restaurant located on the first floor of Burj Al Arab during our recent visit to Dubai. The hotel is grand and the breakfast was delicious, but what made our experience great was the hospitality we received from the team (Bekhruz, Ahmed, Sanjay, Lota & Marianette) by making sure that everything was satisfactory.","5","2018-10"
"Relax","stayed there for work, paid by the company, rented a room with a friend. The room itself was on the 16th floor. The room was two-storied and there was everything you wanted. The staff helped with things at the entrance, thanks to him. The view from the hotel was fantastic. The room.The atmosphere in the room was cozy. After the trip I wanted to go back there. Going out into the waiting room and looking at the top, the ceiling is not visible,","5","2018-02"
"Excellent Stay","Must Try!!! This place is very expensive but definite worth a try.... Staying inside is a total different feeling than just for a visit. You got exceptional service and luxury like none other, there is a butler in every floor level 24 hours for you need. Every waiting staff is super friendly and professionally dressed. ","5","2018-10"
"Simply Extraordinary","Theres nothing I can say that can make this hotel better. Its simply extraordinary. If you want to experience pure luxury and be treated like royalty then you must visit. From the moment you get there till your last minute you are treated like royalty. Every little thing is taken care of and theres nothing they wont do to make you more comfortable. Thanks for an amazing stay.","5","2017-12"
"Truly a unique experience","From the moment we arrived at the airport till when we returned to the airport for our departure - you are treated like Royalty. The experience of staying here, the archtiecture, Dubai itself - it really is a awesome one. Friendly staff, always willing to help - go the extra mile. The location and the hotel itself is unimaginable, only once you set foot onto the island do you realise the beauty. ","5","2018-02"
"Best experience EVER!!!","Best experience we have ever had so much so i went 3 times!!

Once for a week with my two sons, a couples long weekend and my mothers birthday.

What can I say accommodation amazing, food amazing (I ate in all the restaurants through my visits), staff who couldn't do enough to please you. I loved every single minute.

I would highly recommend a visit, you don`t need to go around dressed up in fact you find the people who are all dressed are usually just visiting for the day.

The staff went out their way for my sons who were 10 & 12yrs at the time of visit they had a great time.

**stayed 2009, 2010 & 2011**","5","2017-11"
"DON'T DREAM OF LIVING...........LIVE THE DREAM!!!","There are lots of ways that you can spend your money, some rewarding and some a waste of time and money. Here at the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah you live like a Princess and dine like a Queen. Totally unrestrained luxury, pampered by the wonderful staff from start to finish. Fantastic views, gorgeous suite, divine food. Amazing stay.","5","2018-07"
"Top Cocktails at Gold Bar","We visited as two couples for a special occasion. We were not disappointed. Gold bar was full of atmosphere and fantastic views over Dubai. We tried different and spectacular cocktails with lots of theatre and good flavours. It’s pricey but worth it for the experience. Book at table and you get to have a look around the hotel on you’re way up to the bar. ","5","2018-10"
"Buffet dinner at Al Iwan ","Exceeded our highest expectations

From the moment we stepped inside the luxurious restaurant the staff made us feel welcome and special. They were knowledgeable, engaging and charming. They were attentive to details, noticing what we liked and sharing a delicious surprise for us at the end. The chef Renaldo explained with passion and great knowledge about the different Arabic dishes - his warmth and friendliness made the meal very memorable. 
Ranjam, Mohamed, Hazem and Marianette were exceptional, giving us the best care and attention and made the evening such fun.  We really enjoyed Mohamed’s special Moroccan mint tea. This meal experience has been a highlight of our trip to Dubai. ","5","2018-10"

"Dubai's most iconic brunch!","Stepping into the the Burj Al Arab is already an experience itself. I was lucky enough to have brunch @ Scape restaurant & bar on Friday. We where blown away by such exquisite menu. Not only the service was outstanding but, the food & drinks where incredible. Like always, it's a pleasure to visit the hotel and the amazing mixologist Sheen Benni. Fully recommend this Brunch!","5","2018-10"

"Never Stayed Better, Opulent, Service Impeccable","Well I think I had best stop travelling because no hotel will come near to this one, Superb
We were greeted on our arrival at 6am in the morning and were escorted to what I thought was a lounge area of the Burj, the lovely receptionist completed the formalities whilst we relaxed with champagne.
On completion I enquired where I was to go next assuming we would be shown to our room and was astounded to hear that this beautiful lounge area was our room, I was gobsmacked.
A beautiful staircase led the way to our beautiful bedroom, bathroom and unbelievable sea view.
The bed was not too firm nor too soft, just right.
Full size Hermes toiletries are provided in both ladies and gents scents, absolutely beautiful.
All areas of the hotel are tastefully decorated and opulence abound.
Our Butlers were lovely men and made sure our stay was impeccable.
The private cabana that we enjoyed one day as part of our package was a welcome delight from the 40 degree heat whilst we occasionally ventured out to refresh in the pool. Refreshments are provided and a television with movie selections.
Our included breakfast enjoyed at 2 restaurants was extensive and delicious.
I could go on and on about this hotel but it is the best in the world and the staff work really hard to help achieve this accolade.
Thank you for our unforgettable stay","5","2018-08"
"A couple of days R&R","Stayed at the BAA for the fourth time and it just gets better and better.

"Afternoon tea for anniversary ","We visited the Burj al Arab for our anniversary in September. The service was impeccable. They catered for our dietary requirements including having no cream in some of the pastries for my husband which were all made fresh. They also offered an alternative on one course as they noticed I hadn’t eaten it. The food was lovely and excellently presented. It was pricey at £130 each but a great experience. The harpist was excellent too ","5","2018-09"
"Excellent service ","I went to Burj al Arab last night there is escape lounge there The classy place and the best staff specially the sheesha makers Ahmed and others were so nice he made the best sheesha and I was surprise to see everyone behaving like family usually it never happens but my experience with each and every staff was very nice even the lounge staff every one were so well cleaned and always near to ask you best place to visit at evening thanks ","5","2018-10"

On the way to the pool lounge we met unforgettable Mr. Samy with magnificent smile.  Since that moment he gave us a feeling as we are only people at the hotel. The respect, kindness and desire to tell us more was unbelievable.  
The short tour which Mr. Samy did for us will always  stay in our memories

We really enjoy out short time in Burj AL Arab.

Thank you Mr. Samy.","5","2018-09"
"Absolutely wow","I visited with my partner for 4 nights and it was just pure bliss. We had a one bedroom panoramic suite and the room was gorgeous, the staircase was wow! You were treated like royalty. On arrival you were welcomed and taken straight to your suite where some morning snacks and coffee were in the did of room. The views were amazing!
When we went to the pool, it was quiet and there was plenty of choice for a lounger, none of this fighting for a bed and people reserving beds with towels...as you would expect from this type of hotel. You were greeted by the pool staff as they walked you to your lounger and presented you with cold towels and fresh chilled water. 
We chose not to take our child when we visited this hotel but there were children there. 
The Bal Al Yam buffet restaurant done a fantastic lunch. The pool bar and staff were friendly.
I would definitely recommend this hotel but remember plenty spending money....you’ll need it!
And i will visit again one day, don’t know how I’ll top my next holiday","5","2018-09"
"Wonderful Stay","We had a problem at the time of booking which a manager made sure to resolve quickly and it didn’t effect or stay or impede on our thoughts of the burj. The north deck is a massive improvement and the service is second to non a truly magical stay and so kid friendly our children thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of pool and kids club options. Would definitely recommend ","5","2018-09"
"A Special Breakfast at Sahn Eddar","My family and I went to Sahn Eddar for breakfast yesterday. We had the continental breakfast stand with lots of delicious and exquisite choices. The healthy breakfast option is excellent as well; love the presentation and the guilt-free varieties.

The ambience of the restaurant in the morning is amazing; very relaxed yet with a touch of luxury! The staff are accommodating. Lota and the rest of the team made our day extra special! They gave my Mom and I roses and offered a cake when they learned it's my birthday! Truly a dining experience to remember!","5","2018-10"
"You need to make this experience at least once in your life","We have seen a lot of material in the internet, but feeling it yourself is absolutely recommended - you will remember forever! We recommend this hotel 100%.Every complaint would be ""moaning on a very very high level"". However - Amazing Hotel, amazing suites, very helpful and friendly personnel, just some minor room for improvement in the lobby area during checkin/checkout. I believe some clever organisational processes could improve this dramatically.","5","2018-09"

"Amazing Stay Dubai","Fantastic hotel that offers real hospitality you can expect from a luxury brand. The room is amazing with the best design and layout I ever seen. I'm a travel blogger and stay at luxury hotels all the time. But Burj is a step above the rest. Highly Recommended.","5","2018-02"
"A Must Experience","Another great 6 days at the Burj Al Arab. When asked my response is simple - if you have an opportunity to visit it is a must experience. An army of fantastic people makes the cost worthwhile. We will be returning in 2019.

A few people to call out. Firstly to Alam , one of our butlers on the 10th floor, who took great  pleasure in helping us with every request. Keep up the brilliant work. The Terrace is so relaxing and we were brilliantly looked after by Abbas and his team and whilst we also used the Summersalt beach club our preference is the Terrace although happy to recommend both.

 We ate in Scape twice and again will be returning. We loved the Tuna Cerviche and the Sea Bass and Mel was a great host - my wife’s favourite dining location. Junsui was again very enjoyable and a big thanks to Silvia and Chef Leong for the beautifully prepared food. Finally Bab Al Yam under the leadership of Sateesh and Prashant and the culinary team led by Chef Gurt. Great choice for breakfast and dinner and just a shame it was slightly too hot to sit outside  -our problem. Well done to Teresa and her team for the quality of food and beverage across the hotel.

A must experience, we will be returning and if you have the opportunity go end enjoy the Burj Bubble","5","2018-09"
"Burj Al Arab","Breath taking view atop the Burj Al Arab (Tower of the Arab) Hotel. Starting rate is $1,000 USD per night. You get every pennie's worth!Located on the water front of the Persian Gulf (or Arabian Sea).","5","2018-10"
"Perfection","There is nothing negative to be said, which is very hard to swallow. Perfection from check in to check out. Short visit, 3 nights, but for a special occasion, worth the time, effort and money. Congratulations to all workers, those behind the scenes and those in full view, because one without the other just wouldn't work. If we were people who returned, we would definitely be back, but there are so many other places to visit and see, but a trip we won't easily forget.","5","2018-09"
"Elegant lunch experience!","I was there for a business banquet lunch. Ambiance was great and so was the service. Basically what you would expect from such a wonderful unique hotel. My only criticism would be that food quality especially the steak was not what I expected.","5","2018-09"
"Pure Luxury, a must do great, family memories x","Stayed one night with my husband and 7mth-old son. We had lunch in the seafood restaurant (Nathan Outlaw) it was top notch.

And dinner in Junsui in the evening 

Note: Babies are only allowed in the Junsui restaurant in the evening.

Definitely lived up to its 7* reputation service, food, staff, Ambience, Butler 100% excellent 

Book in and make great memories x","5","2018-09"
"AMAZING HOTEL AND AMAZING SERVICE!","We have just returned from a 5 night stay.  From the moment we arrived (and being greeted by the fabulous Hardley) to the moment we left it was a fantastic experience.

We had a suite on the 10th floor serviced by the amazing butlers Alam and Tanuja.
The hotel really is spectacular, the room was amazing.  A two storey suite with superb views over towards the Palm we felt like royalty from the moment we arrived. Alam showed us our room, explained the facilities and we can honestly say nothing was too much trouble for him.  He was so attentive to our needs and when  he found out it was my husband's 40th and our wedding anniversary he arranged for rose petals to be placed up the staircase and around the room and also served a beautiful chocolate cake to us.  We could do with an Alam at home...he's just amazing!

Breakfast was also gorgeous...the selection was brilliant and the service was also superb. Special mention to Inden who greeted us by name every  morning and served us our latte machiato without us even having to ask - he just knew that was our routine and that made a big difference especially with the number of guests he was serving.

We honestly couldnt fault this hotel, its an experience of a lifetime and you will not be left feeling disappointed....a definite must for any traveller who likes a bit of luxury. We are already considering our next visit!

"Thank you Burj  and Alam","We arrived 6 am and the hotel checked us straight into our suite, very much appreciated. The room, service and facilities did not disappoint.

"Amazing Stay, Incredible Rooms & Service!","We stayed two nights in two rooms on the 10th floor as a family & had an incredible time! The rooms were amazing, but what stood out to us the most was the phenomenal service from all the staff members at the hotel but in particular our designated floors butlers, Alam & Taniya. Alam and Taniya were always attentive to our needs, very friendly and kind people! They made the stay all the difference between a 5-star and a 7-star hotel. 

Great time! We will be back :)

"Amazing Hotel, fantastic staff","Stayed In two suites on 12th floor for 3 nights. Staying with husband and sister and brother in law. There was not a moment I did not enjoy this beautiful luxurious hotel. From the welcome to the goodbye the staff were wonderful, friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. There were two Butlers on each floor who helped with dinner reservations etc and were always happy to help. Rooms were spotless, furniture and soft furnishings pristine. Restaurants and cocktail bar Gold on 27 were fantastic offering lovely food well cooked and well presented and amazing cocktails!  Had a Cabana for the day which was lovely. Prices of drinks were to be expected and like many places in Dubai fairly expensive. Visited the beach club (other side of bridge) which was much more reasonable and on par with London prices. 
Would definitely like to return and would recommend the experience of staying there to all. 
Loved it!","5","2018-09"
"Absolutely Wonderful!!  Definitely a seven star hotel!!","Had an amazing stay at the Burj Al Arab.  Our butler, Alam, on the 10th floor was absolutely phenomenal!  He helped us with everything that we needed and made fantastic recommendations for us to go see around the city.   Would definitely ask for Alam if you are going to the Burj Al Arab — Alam is simply the absolute best!!  

The desk assistant, Tanuja, was wonderful too.  She’s very nice and made sure that our stay was perfect.  

The pool bar staff was fantastic.  Sheham made awesome drinks for us at the swim-up bar.  Sheham is very kind and personable - he was a lot of fun to chat with while we were there.  

Thank you to the Burj Al Arab for making our stay wonderful!

"4 night stay- third visit to the  Burj Al Arab","This is my third stay at the Burj .. I must admit that the overall experience has changed on this visit..  couple of issues with service at the pool, maggots in the strawberries at breakfast! Not what you would expect from the most luxurious hotel in the world.  However, I’m sure they must have been luxurious maggots. Food was Luke warm in the restaurant. I do prefer mine hot. Despite this we still enjoyed our stay, we love the Burj but there is room for improvement. The staff were all lovely and we do live this hotel, however we had a few minor concerns, which were dealt with when we brought them to the attention of managers ","4","2018-09"
"Worst stay at burj Al arab","I faceed the worse treatment from luxurious hotel which supposed to deliver a luxury treatment, since I received an upgarade since i am agold member  the treatment after that became so bad, the utilities in the bathroom removed no shampoo no soap nothing above all of that they charged 1 persson extra in a two bedroom and we are only 3 person 1,800 per night which I don’t know it before they didn’t understand it looks like money all it is matter .Buttler service is a luxury service but if he is not arround most of time or covering two floors it is usless.I escalate the issue to the duty manager but no action. They even shorten my stay one day befor. It is my final visit to burj Alarab and jumeirah hotels. ","1","2018-09"
"Worth it","I didn’t expect to come away feeling I got value for money but that’s just what happened. They give you so much and you will experience something very special here! You’ll be blown away with the gifts they give you, their attention to details and their dedication to your happiness. What more could you ask? We really want to come back. It would be worth a stop over and even just a night. The breakfast was lovely too. They deserve 7 stars they really do- it’s a completely different level to any other hotel I’ve ever stayed.","5","2018-09"
"Nice experience but rooms feeling a bit dated now","Nice stay, staff cannot do enough, pool very nice. Rooms are now looking gaudy and dated, in need of next years refurbishment. TV and entertainment system also dated. Junsui restaurant and Bab Al Yam nice.","4","2018-09"
"Burj Al Arab ~ Piece of Paradise 💫","My partner and I visited Dubai last week and what an amazing trip we had. The place is packed with lots of fabulous places to see and things till do.
The people are extremely friendly, it’s a very clean environment and may I add we felt very safe here. 

But the highlight of our trip was non other than visiting The ‘Burj Al Arab’ for afternoon tea in the ‘Sky View Bar’ and it did not disappoint! 
This was a breathing taking experience from the exquisite food to the spectacular views. 

I booked the afternoon tea for my 30th birthday treat online and corresponded via email with ‘Kamal’ who replied to any questions and queries I had regarding my booking. He was extremely professional and prompt with all emails that I’d sent. He even managed to meet and greet us on the day of our afternoon tea and give us a tour of beautiful hotel and showed us around, to which was outstanding and we throughly enjoyed. 

Our afternoon tea was delightful, we over indulged in lots of fabulous cakes,sandwiches,scones,teas etc and I even managed to receive a birthday cake and a beautiful red rose from our very attentive waiter Robbie, such a lovely guesture. 

The interior and exterior is out of this world and it is absolutely pristine!!

I would thoroughly recommend this experience to anyone visiting Dubai and we hope to return in the future. 

Thank you Burj Al Arab & Kamal, you made our experience one we won’t forget for a very long time. 

Back in rainy Ireland and missing Dubai already!

"Over the top glamour","The Burj is the Burj and does not expect much understanding for the over the top gold glamour.

Loved the service and attention to detail. 

There are certainly so many places to stay in Dubai but this property is one of a kind in terms of out there so give it a try, even if just one night. Spoil yourself!","5","2018-01"
"Amazing .outstanding","Amazing,outstanding hotel Burj al Arab , gave me the feeling as a Celebrity ! From Check in to Check out everything was so different and so unique,love the welcome treats and great. Huge suit like a palace with great views and amenity. At bed time the way they prepared and made the atmosphere it amazed me, like Home away from home ! Love the way Mr Karen prepared my Jakuzzi  , Amazing services Love the terrace and Scape restaurant atmosphere and great food. Breakfast in junsui was tasty and great service great atmosphere. Beach and poolside are excellent. Floor Butler Mr Karen’s services were outstanding. All employees always friendly and smile faced .My stay was so relaxing and so comfortable like dream comes true!","5","2018-09"
"An Absolute Delight","After many years of existence this hotel delivers in every aspect. It is a self proclaimed 7 star hotel and it certainly has raised the bar and maintained the bar at the highest level.
I was fortunate to spend my 30th wedding anniversary staying this wonderful hotel and the staff and anyone we came in touch with ensured our stay was perfect. Rose petals on our dinner table, rose petals in the bath.
This place is not all self proclaimed hype, it is real and it delivers.
I cannot wait to return again, and again, and again.","5","2018-09"
"Marvelous hotel","The room is so spacious. More importantly, the proactive room service makes me so happy. If you stay in your room in the afternoon, the staff will give you a surprise (e.g., sending you a blueberry tart). The pool is fantastic!","5","2018-09"
"The views worth a visit","This was a birthday surprise to go for drinks whilst we were in Dubai. The booking was simple, we did this online and it was all confirmed, obviously be aware there is a minimal spend which you will reach due to the prices but check this before you book. 

We arrived early so walked around the hotel and I must say it did not wow me, the hotel itself even with gold plates and water fountain was ok but compared to the other hotels we had been too I did not feel it was spectacular. I understand not having seen the rooms this is just a snippet view but from what I saw it was standard for me.

The Skyview Bar was great, we were lucky to get seats near the window and the view was amazing! There was no rushed turnover time, we were given snacks and the cocktails were delicious! Kumar served us throughout the night and was so attentive, friendly and explained which drinks would be best suited according to what we like, so helpful! 

My partner told the management it was my birthday so to finish our lovely night Kumar brought me a cake out and flowers which was very lovely. 

The drinks are costly but an experience and if you can do it then go as it is something you will love and be impressed with!","5","2018-09"
"Simply the best!","My wife booked the Burj as part of my 50th birthday celebrations and we were both blown away with the luxury of the place. This isn't a hotel, it's an Icon, an image and we're in the belly of it.The suites are amazing, great size and just love the fact that there is an upstairs to retire to, brilliant! I will however mention that there are a couple of loose ends, like the electrics are looking a bit tired and loose in some places, also, and this is a big bug bearer for me and that's the quality of the toilet paper, its cheap, I've had better quality at a travelodge, it's the same at Al Qasr, poor quality tracing paper..For a hotel of such standard the toilet paper should at least be of better quality...apart from that this place is a most stay for it's views and comfort.","5","2018-09"
"An Experience not a Stay","The hotel describe this as an ""Experience"" rather than a ""Stay"".  I thought they were overselling themselves - they were not.Even before our departure date I was receiving emails asking for any preferences I may have.  The arrival, the room, the staff were all brilliant.If I was pushed to find an issue it would be that children are not allowed in the bars.  However, this is the law of the land (age 21) so it’s a case of  ""When in Rome ...""Find an excuse, find the money and go.","5","2018-09"
"Meho & Sebi","Amazing Place, worth the ratingHaven't stopped talking about it to family & friends5th visit to Dubai BUT this takes the cake.Valeria & Fadi greeted us and made our stay wonderful.. Will be back ;)","5","2018-09"
"Treat yourself for the day!","We rented a private cabana on the pool terrace for the day so we could experience a little of the Burj al Arab ambience and hospitality.  Not cheap but well worth the money, such a relaxing day in beautiful surroundings.  The staff were so attentive, it was our anniversary that day, and they made our day really special with cocktails, cake and flowers for me.  Even gave my husband a pair of BAA flip flops so he didn't burn his feet on the way to the pool!  Lovely touch. ","5","2018-08"
"Opulence 6 star","This is an amazing building in a friendly country  Staff was very attentive and respectful.  However, opulence has its cost it was very expensive but seeing it was my partners birthday it was worthwhile. I would love to go again.","5","2018-07"
"Superb Mini Break","Spent 3 nights / 4 days in absolute luxury.  Hotel is breathtaking inside and out.  Suites are huge and fantastically equipped.  Facilities / Restaurants are all top notch but its the people who bring this hotel to life from Valeriia who greeted us to our butlers Sami/AJ/Dinesh and Mirahjon, Philomela at Bab Al Yam restaurant and Timo (and his colleagues) on the pool terrace these guys made our vacation and will be the reason for our future return.  They just couldn't do enough to make you feel special.Having read previous reviews when we checked-in we got Mirahjon our butler to spend time going round our suite explaining the facilities  and what was included and what was additional this allowed us to relax as we knew the costs of any decisions we were making. ","5","2018-09"
"Opulent hotel but worth the cost","Staying at the Burj for three nights en route to the Maldives. Hotel is very luxurious, but also very expensive. Mind you Dubai is expensive in general.

Temperature about 40 Celsius every day. If we came again would probably come a month later as very hot although air con everywhere.

Also the Burj is very expensive you are treated like loyalty. The room is a two floor suite, and the bathroom has lots of Hermes toiletries that they replenish every day. All large bottle and perfume and aftershave so we are coming back with half a suitcase of toiletries!

Service is second to none.

Will definitely return","5","2018-09"
"Supreme luxury - a class of its own","Two bedroom suite is a duplex apartment with everything you can imagine. We didnt feel like going out as everything was provided. Lots of complimentary gifts together with unmatched service. Personalized check-in inside our own room was very impressive.
We booked the suite to celebrate birthday and they gave us the best birthday surprise!","5","2018-09"

The hotel lives up to its seven star rating - from arriving to departing we were provided with first class treatment. Afternoon tea itself is outstanding - a real treat. The service was exemplary.

"Hotel with un-compromised luxury","Burj Al Arab is no doubt most luxurious hotel in Dubai, if not in the world. Really enjoyed our stay here but only think i didnt like about the hotel is the bed and the pillows. All staff are very friendly and curtious but two name in particular who were above the rest Tanuja, from the butler reception on our floor and kobir, buggy driver. They were super friendly, goes above and beyond and stand out amongst the rest when it comes to providing service with a smile","5","2018-09"
"Worth a night","I will surely not go into the price details as this is a 7 star property & you expect it to cost up to the level...we stayed here just for 1 night for an experience ...the buffet was just superb ...interior of the hotel is a worth a visit itself...They have a central fountain inside the lobby where you take stairs up the floor...Blue & gold interior is usually observed & they even offered us hermes goodies...the bar view from top was splendid ...you can see the world islands as well as palm islands!.

"Amazing food and service ","Been here twice now and it’s been great both times 
I’ve had the buffet the two times I have been, the food is just so amazing you  just have to try each dish. The staff are so friendly as well and if you ask for a certain dish they will cook it for you ","5","2018-09"
"one of a kind experience with excellent service","Burj Al Arab was quite an experience with everything during this stay being over the top. We had the smallest room which was a two story 180 qm in arabic design with 2 bathrooms one being a big mosaic bathroom with huge bathtub, big living room with tea area, bedroom and dressing area. The service in this hotel is top notch. I removed some little soaps in the small bedroom and ten minutes later they were already replaced. all the staff working in the hotel were super friendly and noticed small details about the guests and their wishes.

 I loved the spa on the 18th floor with stunning views over the palm. if you travel as a couple or are on honeymoon you need to know the spas are seperated for man and woman. i also had a massage which was great. 
The upstairs bar on the top of the hotel was quite amazing and they had delicious pasta :)
I also loved their beach club which was a great place to relax during the day.
Coming from Europe this kind of excellent service in all areas (like getting your bag carried to the beach or someone coming with you to press the elevator button for you) might feel a little surprising at times but staff were super friendly and actually were relaxed when i told them not to worry that I can carry my handbag myself :) 
They really try to create the most perfect experience for their guests and I would recommend the hotel for everyone looking for an outstanding hotel experience a bday trip, surprise or special occasion for friends, couples or families","5","2018-08"

"Anniversary Breakfast (Burj Al Arab - Sahn Eddar)","We chose to have breakfast at the Burj Al Arab restaurant for our 20th wedding anniversary. We found the service to be above and beyond what we could have expected, they catered exceptionally well for our 6 year old (who can be a fussy eater). From the experience and the service we received, we encourage other visitors to not think twice as we could not find a single fault with the restaurant and venue itself. 

This day was made very special and we will definitely visit again, if and when we visit Dubai again.

A huge thank you to a select few of people who were very attentive throughout and welcoming upon our arrival: Lota, Regina, Glacie and Durga.","5","2018-08"

"Don't miss this hotel.","Burj Al Arab is part of The Jumeirah Beach Resort complex, situated on Jumeirah Beach Road, a leisurely half hour drive from Dubai International Airport. Soaring 321m; Burj Al Arab towers above the renowned Jumeirah Beach Hotel and Wild Wadi Water Park. This unique sail-shaped building stands proudly on a man-made island some 280m offshore, linked to the mainland by a slender, gently curving causeway.","4","2018-08"

"Family oriented luxury","Most reviews already speak to the beautiful grounds, luxurious feel and top shelf staff that comes with staying at the burg, but my experience went beyond this. From the moment we stepped through the door we were treated with special care. My 6 year old was greeted and skipped off hand and hand with our greeter as we were taken to our suite. She later returned with a stuffed animal and hand written letter since my daughter mentioned her love for animals. 

Once in the room we were given a bottle of wine as a complimentary gift. My daughter asked where her ""special gift"" was. Little did we know our butler heard and returned with a special sweet treat just for her. 

Our butler even returned and ran our bubble bath for us later and refilled our complimentary fruit basket because we eat a lot of it. Every detail whether big (making reservations at the seafood restaurant Al Mahara while vegan) or small  (night time turn down service) were thought of. I especially appreciate the anniversary cake and roses that the staff presented to me. 

All and all my stay couldn't have been any more magical. ","5","2018-05"
"Burj al arab","Absolutely beautiful luxurious piece of architecture is worth the visit. Dinner at the hotel was great !!! The landscape was serene with beautiful waters surrounding. Must visit this place if your in Dubai.","5","2018-08"
"One for the bucket list!","We would go back to Dubai just to stay at the Burj Al Arab again! We stayed there for 4 nights in August in a Two Bedroom Suite! Although we had plans as a family to do more sightseeing in Dubai, we enjoyed the hotel so much that we ended up spending more time on the grounds and eating at the fantastic restaurants. The pool area is fantastic! The service is exceptional! The only disappointment was that we had to leave! ","5","2018-08"
"Not worth the money","Not worth the hype! Over priced and over rated. Hotel seems to be in need of an upgrade. Food was average at best. Service was good. Breakfast Buffet you can find at any 4 star hotel. A lot of people wandering around taking photos","3","2018-08"

"Superb wedding anniversary experience","We celebrated our wedding anniversary here and the hotel did not disappoint. On arrival we were greeted by name and my wife was given a bouquet of roses. We had booked a panoramic one bedroom suite which had fantastic sweeping views of dubai. The room was very well decorated and i did not notice much wear and tear. We had rose petals sprinkled over the surfaces in the bathroom and more flowers.  During our stay we ate at various restaurants at the hotel - the staff at each one were all aware we were celebrating our anniversary so more petals and cake!  Scape restaurant was very good for both lunch and dinner.  Nathan Outlaw is nice for the atmosphere eating next to an aquarium but we found the food expensive for what it is. Cocktails are excellent at the skyview bar.  We went once to the beach club outside the hotel but the pool was crowded so we spent the rest of the stay at the Terrace which is super and you do not miss the beach at all.  We have stayed on several occasions at other Jumeriah hotels but this one really deserves its reputation and we would fully recommend it if you are looking for something a little special.","5","2018-07"

"Out of this world!","Stayed at the Burj al Arab to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary - i can only use one word to describe our experience and that is incredible.  Having been lucky enough to stay at many of Dubai’s top hotels my expectations were already pretty high but I must say we were blown away by the levels of hospitality we received.  Would definitely recommend and will most definitely return. The Burj Al Arab is the most iconic hotel in the world for good reason outstanding building, outstanding amenities and outstanding staff - loved it!","5","2018-08"
"Luxury with love and care","The hotel is epitome of luxury and is a class apart.  The ambience is unmatched.  Beyond ambience it's the staff who made the stay memorable with their care and love throughout our stay. Enjoyed the many facilities available for the family which made the stay very special. ","5","2018-08"
"Exceeded Expectations....mostly.","Our decision to book a three day stay at Burj Al Arab was not made lightly.  Dubai has no shortage of reasonable, highly-rated, opulent, luxurious, hotels. It was hard to justify paying nearly three to four times the average hotel rates and in the end we decided that experiencing the Burj brand was worth the splurge. I’m delighted we did. 

I, unfortunately, made a very expensive mistake and ended up spending as much on a bottle of Chardonnay as I did for one night
In the hotel.  Before I explain, it’s important to point out that I take full and total responsibility for my error and have no plans to dispute the charge. However, if I can save someone else from making the same extremely expensive mistake, I feel obliged.

After a 15 hour flight, I arrived at the Burj exhausted and excited. I was met by the most lovely butler, who gave me a grand tour of my suite and presented me with a bottle of wine compliments of the hotel. I asked if I could exchange the free bottle with a Chardonnay and he explained there would be a room service charge and asked if (insert whatever brand he said here). My first mistake was not asking a price and assuming he would replace the free bottle with a like priced Chardonnay. In addition, I asked him to bring club soda because I’m a lightweight and drink wine with soda.  Second mistake was not boning up on the UAE to USD conversion rate. So, when I signed for the wine, I still had no clue what I just did.

It was only at checkout that I realized a mistake had been made.  While I take responsibility, I do think the butler might have given me the option of the two Chardonnays on the menu.  One was a Robert Mondavi for 500 Dirham and the Italian Chardonnay I drank on ice with seltzer was a whopping 4,000 Dirham.  He might have mentioned that. 

I have wondered more than once if this little bait and switch is a policy of the hotel or just an innocent oversight. I hope it’s the latter because it’s the only thing that tarnished the Burj experience.

"Perfect Anniversary","We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary here last week.  We went in with high expectations and they were easily exceeded.  Very well maintained property, outstanding suites and ammenities, and some of the best staff we have ever experienced.  We mentioned our anniversary at time of booking and they made it the theme of our stay - from flowers to all staff congratulating us each time they saw us.  We really felt like we were taken care of here.  Only regret was staying one night.","5","2018-08"
"BLOWN AWAY AGAIN","The Burj Al Arab has a timeless beauty which my family have been privileged to experience 3 times and each time, unique memories are created.  We can only say that if anyone is lucky to visit, they will feel true hospitality and the Butler Service is the link to making things happen. ","5","2018-08"
"Burj Al Arab - A must stay if visiting Dubai","We recently visited Burj Al Arab expecting it to be a one off vacation of a lifetime.  However after staying there we can say that we will definitely be going back.  From the airport transfer on arrival until the transfer back to the airport everything could not have been more perfect.  The entire staff ensured that we had a vacation we would never forget.  It was my wifes birthday while we were there and they all ensured she would never forget it.  The butler for our room was Alam and though all the staff helped make this a stay to remember it was Alam who made sure that we will never forget this experience.  He had this knack of knowing what we wanted before we did with nothing being to difficult for him to arrange or do for us.  He walked with you down to breakfast, down to the pool ensuring we were looked after.  He arranged a buggy tour of the nearby resort  which we wanted to see.  He was always there vwith fresh flowers particularrly on my wifes birthday and a beautiful cake which tasted really good.  He would arrange tables for us for dinner and showed us around the hotel giving us a personal guided tour.  I could write forever describing how good he was but instead I will say that we will thanks to Alam be staying at Burj Al Arab again in the future.  It is expensive but in my opinion worth every penny we spent there.  If you are in Dubai this is a must location to stay at.  Thank you Alam for making this a vacation we will never forget","5","2018-08"
"Different way to life !","There's no denying this is an up market hotel , the interior opulence is slightly over the top for my personal taste but I cannot fault the attentive and professional staff , the facilities are first class and you do very much feel like royalty when you stay , very different experience to any hotels I've stayed in , in Europe! Hefty price per room and I'd imagine if you shopped around you'd get a fabulous hotel elsewhere in the UAE for the same money , all in all a fab experience which is now ticked off our bucket list .","4","2018-08"
"Not good services","The overall stay was okay but not worth $1500-2000 per night. Check in / check out service were not good probably due to many customers staying at the same time. The fitness gym was clean and comfortable. ","2","2018-08"
"Spoil yourself and your family","We only had good experiences at Burj Al Arab. We brought our 7 years old son and he enjoys the Kid Club “Sinbad” 3 hours a day. It is a very upmarket hotel yet we could come and go in flip flops and shirts and be ready for beach, pool or Wild Wadi Waterworld”. All the restaurants we experienced were amazing, service impeccable and professionalism of the multi nationality staff is incredible. Our butler knew the name of our son and they made him enjoy the stay too - Thomas the Train even came to our room - great initiative for children. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Burj Al Arab. We understand why it is recognised as the best hotel in the world and 7 stars ! Just look at it ! ","5","2018-08"
"The 7 star hotel (unaffordable)","This is probably the most gaudy hotel I've ever stayed in. The suites go up to 50000 dollars and the basic room I  about 4000 per night. However I've got to tell this the service is the best there is in the world. But the main question is can you really afford it? It's highly exquisite and luxurious, it is a real gem among all the hotels I've ever visited. Staying just one night is not very satisfying because by the time you get into the groove of a kings life , they request you to check out. ","4","2017-10"

"Beautiful hotel","My husband and I love to stay in Jumeirah hotels in Dubai. We usually stay in villas and al Naseem, but decided to try just for an experience as it’s not very convenient to get to the beach every time you have to wait for a buggy. Also too many tourists taking pictures in the lobby. But this hotel has AMAZING! Amazing what?? Just EVERYTHING inside is really beautiful! We tried many restaurants and the food and the service is great! Rooms, lobby etc is impressively decorated. SPA is excellent and with a stunning view of course ;-) so yes definitely recommended to stay couple of nights just for the experience as I said not super easy to get to the beach. Rest is great! ","4","2018-05"
"Ultimate Luxury","My youngest daughter, 3 grandchildren and I stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. The hotel states it is the best inn the world. I agree. Transport from and to the airport was first class. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a butler and all the staff were very pleasant and helpful. On being taken by a lift to the sixth floor room we were astounded by the luxury of everything in the room. Snacks in the room seemed to never end. The restaurant was a buffet with a very wide range of food. we were given a tour of the buffet before we selected our food. Everything is expensive but that is to be expected. We will definitely return if we are in Dubai.","5","2018-08"
"Amazing hotel and crew","This hotel is amazing from a to z thats why its the best hotel of the word i will come every time when i am in dunai the hile crew the buttler sercice the check in/out in the suite is perfect see you nect time","5","2018-08"
"VERY IMPRESSIVE AMAZING HOTEL -- WOW","Just returned from this amazing hotel,The staff are excellent and we were greeted with a wet towel and cold drink,Our room was out of this world and spotless,The food at restaurants is award winning,The view from our room was truly breathtaking,This hotel is not cheap by any standards but remember you get what you pay for,I will go here again for sure and highly recommend this remarkable hotel.","5","2018-08"
"Of course, what else?  Expensive, but an experience in luxury","Extreme luxury all around.  I mean, I thought Le Blanc in Cancun or The Peninsula Hong Kong with their limo or Royce pickup was the ultimate luxury until I was welcomed at the airport by their agent and my driver.  At the hotel, our butler was amazing and seem to be able to read my mind.  He even reserved shots at the bar itself and of course, all our activities, reservations etc... Until Disney hotels, the Burj doesn't charge you for anything and everything.  

The view, is amazing as well.  It is expensive to be sure. But, it is well worth it.","5","2017-09"
"Once again an excellent stay","Excellent stay. The quality of service is outstanding, particularly Aldrin on 19 and Sammy, Abbas and all the staff at the pool.  Quality food and drinks service at all bars and restaurants. Can't wait to return. ","5","2018-08"
"stay at the suite Burj Al Arab","Unbelievable stay, I think if you like service and the best of everything, you have to try this once in a lifetime, it is definitely worth the money. I love the Jumeirah chain and the Burj Al Arab is the best.","5","2018-08"
"Fantastic Place","I have stayed in a number of Dubai hotels and always wanted to try the Burj Al Arab. I had promised myself a visit here since the hotel opened and have now stayed there twice. 

Security is tight, but we were whisked through as we were in a hotel car. 
The concierge sent us straight through and we were escorted to our floor. Here we were introduced to our butlers and then taken into the suite for the completion of the check-in formalities. 

Although you know what to expect, it is still a jaw dropping moment as you survey the suite and all it has to offer. This was the one bedroom deluxe suite, set on two floors.

The suite is just lovely and you would describe the prices as ""reassuringly expensive"". 

The butlers on our floor were absolutely fantastic and they never failed to greet us enthusiastically every time we approached. Every time you entered the room, they had left some ""goodies"" for you to nibble on.

Breakfast was without doubt the best buffet breakfast I have ever eaten anywhere. Gulf shrimp, Tasmanian Salmon, Exotic fruits. Everything was delicious.  The service and the food was excellent.  

The new pool area at the rear of the hotel is absolutely amazing with two massive infinity pools. It was never anywhere near busy and you really felt relaxed.

The private beach area across the causeway was lovely. An attendant escorts you to your sunbeds and arranges a cool box full of ever replenished water to be at your side at all times. Cold towels are provided regularly. 

On the negative side, many of the restaurants don't allow children under a certain age, and all insist on long trousers which I sort of understand but I really don't see why a nice pair of chino shorts would be allowed. I really wanted to that my children to Nathan Outlaw's restaurant but they were too young to go. A real shame.

The other negative was that if you went out of the hotel by buggies to visit the local reataurants in the complex, you didn't feel ""special"" at all. Sometimes we had to wait half an hour or more to get a buggy and it's a free for all. They used to have Burj Al Arab buggies but that exclusivity seems to have gone. One night my wife walked back because we waited over an hour for a buggy and she got awful blisters. I really do think the hotel should provide exclusive pick ups for their customers, or at least a facility to call a buggy at a certain time. VERY IMPORTANT.

If this hotel is on your ""bucket list"" do it at least once. The trouble is that it will spoil you, and once probably won't be enough as we discovered!","5","2018-04"
"Half board joke","The half board is an absolute joke !  All jumeirah regulars including ourselves assumed that the half board  is the same throughout Jumeirah  as it has been every other property,  yet the other cheaper properties can come to the Burj Al Arab and use their half board and the higher paying burj customers may not use the other outlets it must be the biggest joke in the jumeirah corporation, 
The new pool complex is superb though we preferred to go to Summersalt the beach club, our 2 bed suite was outstanding as was alam our butler who took care of our every need, thanks alam.
More of a short stay stopover than a full holiday resort, truly stunning hotel let down by some silly management decisions making you feel they only want stopovers not true holidaymakers.
The lower rating is purely  due to our half board experience, we are regulars at jumeirah and often meet up with others for meals even though sometimes they are not in the same hotel, our friends stopping at Al Naseem joined us at the burj for a meal on their half board, yet my daughter couldn’t visit them using half board while we went elsewhere SO PAY DOUBLE TO GO TO THE BURJ AND GET LESS  PRIVILAGES !!! So may as well stay in adjacent Jumeirah Beach Hotel or Madinat , visit burj for meal/ experience and save thousands of pounds.
There is also no club lounge so happy hour is in your room ( fine if you’re private people) but no  socialising ","3","2018-08"
"A 7 Star hotel","We stayed for 3 beautiful nights last week. The service was the best ever. The room well what can I say it was truly luxurious, from  the bathroom goodies to the turndown, our floor butler, the swimming pools and the buffet breakfast. Will  be back.","5","2018-08"
"Spectacular !","One of the most finest opulent hotels in the world. The moment you step into the place, you are transported into a totally different world altogether. The lobby is mesmerising. The staff simply brilliant. The rooms spectacular and detail to attention. Luxury at its real best. ","5","2018-08"
"Really nice","A perfect choice for a special occasion. We really enjoyed the afternoon tea at the luxury hotel.  The sea around was beautiful. You feel the richest all around. Really worth the visit and is a must try","5","2018-08"
"Unbelievable stay","Truly First class experience - recommended!  From the minute we arrived we were greeted by name and very professionally. The panoramic suite was fabulously accommodated and appointed, and the toiletries were second to none - Hermes!  ","5","2018-08"
"Superb","Superb stay but food options were very limited , beach and swimming pool was great experience . 
Bathroom amenities were luxurious .
View from room was great

Over all super and good life time experience.. ","4","2018-08"
"Visiting my brother ","We went to Dubai to visit my brother. I wasn’t expecting much from Dubai since I have lived both in USA and Canada . On the other hand this country is absolutely gorgeous. It has the comfort of the West and the beauty of East at the same time. Burj al arab it’s a beautiful tower and it’s one of the main tourist attraction. Also don’t forget to visit their water parks as well. Since they are so close to this tower. It’s one of the best water parks that I have seen in my life time. Enjoy every minute of this beautiful tower with this amazing city.","5","2018-08"
"Amazing!","What a wonderful place. I really did not know what a 7 start hotel was supposed to look like until I went inside. Service quality was amazing and everything was just so vast and colorful. The newly opened terrace is also great.","5","2017-11"
"Vacay to the middle east","We visited Dubai and made reservations to have tea at this gorgeous hotel, we tought it was expensive 250.00 dllrs per person just tea and appetizers, but i think is worth the money, such a wonderful hotel, optimous customer service, in general it was super good and beautiful, will do it again","5","2017-09"
"A 'must see'","An absolutely stunning place, went for afternoon tea with champagne - go hungry!! Much more food than expected and all delicious, although not so great for our vegetarian Daughter (dietary requirements provided at booking stage), a course of lettuce and cucumber? ","5","2017-11"
"Exceptional Hotel & staff","My Wife & i stayed in the Burj Al Arab for a few nights in late June 2018, as the second hotel on our visit to Dubai as part of a 7 night stay, from arrival to departure pretty much everything was perfect. We stayed in a panoramic suite which was just something else !, definitely the largest hotel room we have ever stayed in.
All the staff we met were all so helpful, nothing was too much trouble, but a special mention must go to our Butlers ITA & TIJO, they were outstanding, on our last night the flowers , strawberries , drinks & canapés & hand written thank you card in our room was very special for us, they also helped me arrange the purchase & delivery of a necklace for my wife as a surprise during our meal at Nathan Outlaws restaurant during the evening, thank you guys.
A special thank you too, to our housekeeping.
We dined in Al Muntaha & Al Mahara both outstanding.
Spent lazy days on the beach by the infinity pool & the pool bar staff again fantastic, all very helpful & happy to chat .
Had cocktails a couple of nights in Gold on 27 spoiled for choice, very nice.
Having stayed in quite a few very nice hotels all over the world the Burj Al Arab certainly tops the list for exclusivity, service & luxury, certainly lives up to its seven star billing, we do hope to return on our next visit to Dubai.","5","2018-06"
"Still the same 6 years on...","The family and I happened to be travelling via Dubai and decided to reminisce by having a night at the Burj. We were glad to see that the hotel has hardly changed since our last visit 6-7 years ago and that the service was exactly what you expect from a 7-star hotel - intuitive yet unobtrusive and concierge always willing to assist. 

Our butler from 6 years ago also 'dropped in' to say hi, which was a pleasant surprise but again shows how this hotel goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome with the little things. All the amenities were what you expect (Hermes still) and the kids loved it. Well done to the Burj for continuing its high standard of service. 

Oh and the in-room breakfast is definitely a must do at least once - superb!","5","2018-08"
"Exceptional staff! ","I visited the Burj Al Arab with my family and what can I say....truly amazing! Alam our floor butler was outstanding. We have visited the BAA a number of times, but this trip was made even more special than previous visits by the exceptional service. Nothing was too much trouble from getting the sweet trolley there for when the kids returned from the pool to the parasailing trip to the beautiful flowers he presented to my daughter for her birthday. I will certainly be requesting him as my floor butler on my next visit! 

We spent much time by one of the two fabulous pools on the deck. Again we were treated to outstanding service. The bar staff including Indika, Shiv and Derrick were fabulous. Best milkshakes and cocktails - taking the time to chat with the kids. Professional and friendly. 

The pool staff were also exceptional. Randika and Marco always made sure we had our seats ready, fresh water and brought us treats throughout the day such as ice lolly’s and ice cream. 

The Burj is beautiful and a true taste of the opulent Middle East. However, what really makes it stand out and a 7 star hotel is the staff. Thank you!","5","2018-07"
"What a place","A dream for all that have the opportunity to stay here , A dream come true , just relax and let the day pass by in a way you would just dream about , was just the place to be , as they say when in Dubai do as in Dubai ......","5","2018-07"
"Once A Dream (full review)","We have never imagine that we will get the chance to stay at this iconic 7✨ star hotel. It’s like a dream came true.

One Bedroom Suite - it’s a duplex suite with a huge living room and a round table serve as a dining. The have a small office space on the corner with a Mac computer. Upstairs are the Master Bedroom & the bathroom. The interior design is really elegant. Though it’s not a modern type design but it’s all luxurious like entering a royalty room. The bathroom amenities as mentioned on the booking are Hermès full size toiletries (Body wash, shampoo, conditioner, perfume, after shaved & hand soap) for man and woman. They also have toiletries for my toddler which is so thoughtful. Even the robes they also have one for her small size so cute. Everything that we expect that they have in this suite is there. Like everywhere you look there’s gold details. But there are some few things missing, like something a 7* hotel must have is an updated electronic system. Since there’s an iMac downstairs would be nice to have an iPad that controls the entertainment system, lights, curtains, etc. there’s always room for improvement and I hope Burj Al Arab will take note of that. I also recommend getting a higher floor. And request to have a view of the Madinat hotels side where Mina A Salam.

Indoor Swimming Pool - it is located inside the Talise Spa at the 18th floor. Never gets crowded. But be mindful of taking pictures. It’s not really allowed but if you’re by your self there sometimes the lifeguards let you. But one time we were there and there’s a couple taking photos. We didn’t care at first but when it took them more than an hour taking photos it’s kind of a disrespect. The changing rooms have plenty of cubicles to take shower. And the attendants are really helpful.

The Terrace - it’s a pretty nice pool area which was really new to the Burj Al Arab. It has two swimming one with a swim up bar which my toddler is not allowed and one infinity pool with the view of the ocean and partial Madinat Jumeirah hotels. The service is good. There a only few people when we went so it’s not crowded. What interests me at the terrace is the sandy part close to the infinity pool which made me feel like we’re at the beach. It’s so cool. We didn’t get to try the cabanas coz we’re not sure if it was included on our package.

The Breakfast - there are two restaurant you can choose from for the breakfast either Asian or Continental. The Asian was located at the Junsuí. The staff is so helpful and nice. Plenty of Asian food selections. It’s like a brunch buffet already. And the other one is at the Bab Al Yam. It has great view and the food is just right. The have live egg stations too they also have crepes. 

The Service - I have failed to get their names (my fault) but our butlers are the best. They gave us a tour inside the suite let us know on how to operate things and where are things. They always greeted us with a smile. Even play with our little toddler. They always made us feel like they’re just one second away to be reached. How cool is that. All the staff the we had encountered in the hotel are all nice. From concierge who helped me surprising my husband for his birthday, to the staff at the terrace, the nice hostess at the Junsuí restaurant and the staff at Nathan Outlaw and the staff in the spa they’re just the best.

Overall out of two nights stay made us felt like we’ve stayed there longer than that. It is really luxurious and for us to stay there again next time we have to save again a lot :D. But if you have the money and you want to treat yourself for a luxury I recommend this hotel for you. And if you’re somewhat like us in the middle class, if there’s a special occasion that you wanted to celebrate a birthday or anniversary maybe I recommend staying here too. It’s a once in a lifetime experience for us and we’re never going to forget it. ","5","2018-06"
"Pure luxury","What a hotel! Pure luxury all the way. Service by all staff was professional, friendly & timely. Restaurants were superb, particularly Al Iwan ( Arabic) & Junsui ( Asian).
The air conditioned pool cabanas were appreciated in such hot weather, the price inclusive of complimentary tea/coffee water & softdrinks. The 2 storey, 1bedroom suites are massive in size, well maintained & extremely luxurious. Shuttle buggies were available to visit nearby souks & restaurants at no charge. 
Definitely would recommend for a special occasion!","5","2018-07"
"Amazing return visit","Returned to the Burj Al Arab for another 2 night visit. Last visit, we missed the pool deck opening by days so it was great to get back and experience the pools. As always the rooms, staff and facilities were amazing. The friendliest staff at the pool deck breakfast. Pleasurable staff and a must for anyone who has the opportunity!","5","2018-07"
"Amazing!","We have been going to Dubai for the last 14 years and usually stay in Mina A'Salam.  However, this time we decided to start our holiday with a stay in Burj al Arab.  We have visited this hotel many times over the years for dinner, afternoon tea and cocktails but nothing prepared us for actually staying.  To say we were impressed is an understatement.  We arrived early in the morning and were told that our suite was ready for us and that we had been upgraded.  Our suite was out of this world and we were blown away with everything about it from the size, opulence and the incredible views.  Our butler Kirin was so lovely and helpful as were all the other members of staff throughout the hotel.  The new addition of the Terrace is amazing and a beautiful place to relax throughout the day. The Burj al Arab is truly a cut above the rest and definitely a 7 star experience!   This was meant to be a once in a lifetime experience but I suspect we will be back in the not too distant future.","5","2018-05"
"As good as ever","Still fabulous as ever and service second to none. Looking forward to seeing it after the refurb next year   Thanks to our Butler Afsar for his kind attention and to driver Nasir. Will miss Albin and thanks to him over the years ","5","2018-07"
"Thank you Burj!","Amazing relaxing and delicious breakfast served by the warmest regards of the employees! Thank you Ahmed! The beautiful view, refined ambience, personal care and sincere greetings truly stats the 7 stars of this hotel!","5","2018-07"
"Wonderful experience","I booked this hotel to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and the experience I had from this was out of this world. Hotel staff knew that it was our wedding anniversary and they did everything to surprise us from food drinks to cabana everything was arranged for us.","5","2018-07"
"Stunning sunset","Place is amazing. Had a tour including the venues. Had the best sunset view from the Lounge and from the infinity pool. Very nice and helpful staff. Always smiling. We had a great time there. Hope to come again soon","5","2018-02"
"One of the best Hotel in the world!","Excellent hotel with the best conditions for a careless stay. Nice employees, always with a smile and
a natural feeling for services and hospitality. The seaside terrace has a beautiful beach with mineral
sand and comfortable Cabanas for a private surrounding. Also the bars and restaurants have a nice
collection of top quality food and drinks. That's why I always come back!","5","2018-06"
"What a brilliant place!!","This place really rocks!! The opulence is something which needs to be witnessed. The front facade and the interiors are very well done . A bit over the top, but eventually this is the best hotel in the world and hence has to be over the top.","5","2018-07"
"a great stay","A hotel to feel good with the best service.We were satisfied.The hotel is absolutely recommendable.
Every wish would be fulfilled immediately.A special surprise of the hotel on our wedding day.A lasting
experience.","5","2018-07"
"Beyond Every Expectation","With all the hype, I kind of expected to be a little disappointed with Burt Al Arab —
How could anything live up to that?

I need not have worried. The Burj stretches your imagination, and appeals to all your senses. It’s over the top in so many ways, but, like Vegas without the smarm, it’s all breath taking. 

Superior service at every level — we ate in 3 of the restaurants, which were superb, and loved the spa and workout facilities. If you go, as we did, in the summer, it is hard to take advantage of the outside facilities—. It’s just too hot. But there’s more than enough to keep you going inside the property. 

We viewed this as a stopover to break up a long trip, but we found 2 nights only whetted our appetite to return.","5","2018-07"
"Rightly 5 star","Wonderful hotel with great reception. You will feel like a really important person . Guys do anything to make you feel happy. We just had to visit as we heard about the inside beauty and it really impressed us","5","2018-06"
"Family Outing","It’s a thrilling experience to stay in one of the world most luxurious hotel. We stayed one night. In Dinner, there are no Indian dishes. But to our surprise the chef arranged North Indian cuisines exclusively for us. Really great","5","2017-12"
"A cut above the Rest","This Hotel is simply a cut above the rest , with the addition of the Terrace it is the icing on the cake!
A True 7 Star Experience, the suites are out of this world and the Butler service is great. This is a special place for a special occasion I am looking forward to returning to the Burj Al Arab again.  ","5","2018-07"
"Exquisite afternoon tea","My husband and I had an amazing afternoon tea in Burj Al Arab during our honeymoon. There are so many courses and all the food was delicious - including dates, prawn cocktail, sandwiches, sorbet and sweets/scones. We had prosecco, and a big selection of tea and coffee are also available. We were so well looked after right from the time we stepped out of the taxi at the hotel. Our server in particular was so pleasant and helpful and gave a detailed description of what was included in each course. I also received flowers from the hotel as it was our honeymoon, which was a really nice touch. We chose a window seat and had an amazing view of Jumeriah. I would recommend anyone going for afternoon tea to book a window seat - it's totally worth it! Thank you to all the staff for giving us an unforgettable afternoon tea experience. We hope to return again!","5","2018-07"
"They never let me down.","I have stayed at this property three times so far and will definitely be back. Although I tend to be a very picky guests, I have literally no complaints on this property. The rooms are obviously beautiful and comfortable, views are breathtaking and staff is exceptional.
The candy train visit to the rooms is just a special touch. I had not visited the inside pool and the Spa during my first two visits. Glad I did on my last trip.

You can find my travel photos on IG @charlottezanzi","5","2017-09"
"A Dream Come True","Staff upon arrival was okay. However throughout the stay room butler and every service was amazing ! I miss this place and I left yesterday I will definetly return everything was magical great job Burj al Arab !","5","2018-07"
"Over-The-Top Luxury!","Excellent over-the-top luxury in every way. Fantastic service, dining and amenities. Yes, it’s very expensive but there’s nothing else like it! Picked up from the airport in a RR. I booked a multi-story suite which included a 24/7 personal butler, really nice. The outside pool deck is amazing and the private beach area is very nice as well. ","5","2017-12"
"A tick off the bucket list","The Burj Al Arab takes hospitality to another level, and then more.  Pretty much everything about it has the wow factor.  Particular accolades go the the people, who provide a welcome and level of service I have never experienced before in many years of luxury hotels, and the thought that has gone into the design of amazing suites","5","2018-07"
"Incredible!","One of the most incredible hotels at which I’ve stayed.  Our two story suite had gorgeous panoramic views.  The hotel staff went above and beyond to anticipate our needs, providing a level of service that was on another level.  Our stay at Burg Al Arab made our stay one to remember!","5","2018-07"
"The Next Level for service","A surprise stay for my wife 50th birthday and wow What a stay from the point of being picked up in the Rolls Royce to the little things like the cleaning of sunglasses 
the service is in a different league our 4 day stay was located on the 21st floor with views over towards the palm. not the room if you don't like heights.

we visited many of the restaurants where we were not disappointed with service and quality. 
if you like a cocktail the sky bar and Gold on 27 is a must don't go for a cheap drink its a visit to remember and we certainly will.
a request was made for a ballon decoration and a birthday cake this was more than was expected with over 100 ballons and a cake that lasted for days.
our days were spent between the terrace and summer salt beach club both great venues
one being beach and other within the Burj Al Arab Hotel both First class 
Overhaul we would say its not the cheapest location But its not always about Cost its more about true memories

Many Thanks to All at Burj Al Arab 

We will be returning","5","2018-07"
"My 42nd birthday at Burj Al Arab","Though our experience is superb and unforgettable as a whole, pls make sure everything on the suite is perfectly ok before check in. Because the control system on the master bedroom didn't work well using the remote.  We only confirmed this the night of 13th July when we are about to sleep that the light switch is not working, and we couldn't turn off all the lights for better sleeping. Though the butler tried to fix it herself she needs to call the technician to have it fixed. Though the technician has fixed it we didn't sleep early as planned. Then we thought it will be the last problem but during around 2 or 3 am the aircon system went crazy and we are sweating on bed that we have to transfer to the other room with our kids. We didn't bother to call the butler as we don't have much time to wait before it could be fixed and sleep again. Though our request for late check out is granted, I suggest you check the suite entirely before checking in of guests, so everything will be completely enjoyed and there will be no more wasting of time specially for those who are just staying for a night. ","5","2018-07"
"AWSOME","Overall one of the best experiences of my life. The staff always had a smile and a friendly hello. I opted for the rolls royce from the airport to the hotel, expensive but well worth it. Can not wait to stay again","5","2018-07"
"amazing hotel!","I was on the breakfast one month ago in Shan Eddar restaurant and I'm impressed. The service is discreet and courteous. The breakfast was varied and delicious. In addition, the restaurant manager: Marta Grzywacz was very helpful and hospitable. She told us a few words about the hotel and history. And her smile made us feel better. I would recommend!","5","2018-06"
"One of the best hotels in the world","I had visited this hotel before as a diner, but this was the first time I dared to stay here. My flight arrived at 9am, but no problem. They sent me right up to the room. The room was huge: two floors with a wide staircase connecting them. The attention to detail was impressive. The stationary in the room was the best I’ve ever seen in a hotel. Each night at turn down service, housekeeping left a different, interesting item on your pillow. Free dates in the room also. There is a concierge desk on every floor that is so good, you would be embarrassed not to tip them when you check out. The only place I ate, besides the excellent breakfast, was at the Middle East buffet, which was very good. There are two lounges on the top floor, and, thanks to the concierge on your floor, you will be greeted as you step off the elevator. The lounges are well designed, and you get free munchies on a serving tray in the shape of the hotel. I have gold or platinum status with all the major hotel companies, so I’m not easily impressed, but these people did it.","5","2017-09"

"High tea, high life.","Experienced the high tea at the Burj Al Arab in January 2018. I cannot express how amazing it was.

Incredible service, amazing food, great views, great atmosphere.

Do it!","5","2018-01"
"Couple nights get away","Yes.. it was expensive Like a few of the other hotels around the world but one night is not enough. Do not do only one night. It's like smelling food and having to leave. 2 nights is the feeling of as if you spent only one night.  Great experience.  The pool... hmmmm nothing special at all.. disappointment actually.","4","2018-05"

"Ultimate Delight","I had breakfast at this small lobby restaurant. Super attentive staff and a delightful extra healthy breakfast. The outside view is of the beach across the water but the attraction is the stunning, gorgeous lobby. A peaceful place to be rather than being in the 111 degrees outside. Lots of help with getting phone and computer charged and very kind attention tion to every detail.","5","2018-07"
"Prit","This is worlds one of the finest property. Its location is outstanding and so is the interior. The suits are very well appointed and has that Royal touch, special mention for the toileteries kept in Bathroom ","5","2018-06"
"Burj al  Arab","Very nice place with sea beach,clean water we played on the beach too,sea coast guards were there to guide people, kayaking was there.We had a nice experience ,people were entering to sea and collected shells.","5","2018-06"
"Burj Al Arab - Nice place","I came to Dubai with my family. We went to see Burj Al Arab. I was mesmerized after seeing the Beauty of the place. It was such a wonderful ambience. We went to Scape restaurant and had Dinner there. It was great experience","5","2018-07"
"Place like nowhere else.","Our stay in Burj Al Arab was outstanding and very much enjoyable. We were amazed by how well maintained this place is and all the services where excellent.  Sea food restaurant  was best choice for our dinner, as well as Bab al Yam buffet for our lunch. Definitely recomend to stay here and have this amazing experiance.","5","2018-06"
"Just perfect in every way...","I don't know how it gets better than this. How there are 29 hotels on Tripadvisor ranked better than this, I have no idea. And I have stayed at many of them, and there is no way they're better than this, in my opinion. Is it expensive? Yes. But is is an experience like no other? To me, in Dubai, it's a resounding yes.

What's so fantastic about this hotel is the service. From the butler on your floor opening your door, to giving you whatever you want/need, it's outstanding. Now other hotels do have great service, but what set this apart was that the staff knows how to cater to you WITHOUT being up in your face all the time. They know when to approach, they know when to keep their distance. In short, they know how to read the room.

Rooms are spectacular, food was delicious, staff was friendly, and the pool was relaxing. Same great service applied across the board. Now this isn't a place that you'll go a lot (unless you're really rich), but to experience it once (or from time to time), is worth the price of admission, for sure.","5","2018-06"
"Meal","We booked meal on 23rd floor restaurant this was the best experience of my life and we ate food that wowed us - every course was unreal and the staff and service was fantastic- we would definitely return ","5","2018-06"
"Burj Al Arab birthday","The Burj Al Arab is far and beyond the best hotel I’ve ever been to. I visited Dubai for my birthday and when the staff found out, they threw me a private birthday surprise and all! Their staff there at the establishment  is simply phenomenal... unmatchable!","5","2018-06"
"Beautiful hotel","Hotel was great,housekeeping team were amazing as well as the front desk team would surely visit again.The food in the restaurant t had a lot of options and I mainly enjoyed the breakfast .I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel to everyone I k ow","5","2018-05"
"7-Star Luxury Indeed","Reserved for a table in one of the restaurants of Burj Al Arab. This gave me the opportunity to check out the hotel, touted as a 7-star hotel. Tourists cannot just walk in to see the hotel. You have to be a registered guest or have a reservation in one of their restaurants. I was able to roam the lobby, mezzanine and the oceanside with its glorious infinity pool facing the Persian Gulf. The lobby looked like an art work from the floors to the walls. Look up and there's a gorgeous design and geometric pattern. A terrace of fountains grace the facade with 2 escalators leading to the mezzanine where there are shops, restaurants and a waiting area. This lavishly designed hotel is a feast for sore eyes.","5","2018-06"
"Amazing breakfast at Sahn Eddar Dubai","I visited Sahn Eddar restaurant on Friday morning and I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. My whole experience  was outstanding and really enjoyed the time spent there. Food was fresh and timely prepared.  People who served us were the nicest people I've ever met. Especially I would like to thank  Malgorzata Grzywacz who took care of every single details and made my experience memorable and exceptional.","5","2018-07"
"Bobo's famliy","Impressive tirp ever in my life. Excellent experienced that I never had. We will return to Burj Al Arab angin. My little boy told me that he will viste hotel with his friend after several years. ......","5","2018-06"
"WOW   the best hotel in the world.","Great flight on Emirates as normal,  Dubai Airport is Amazing & my wife always buys perfume on the return as the perfumes our the best selections,  we were picked up in a beautiful Rolls Royce Limo to the hotel  O.M.G.  it's so BEAUTIFUL from outside looks like a Sail, we were greated & bags taken from the car, our room was amazing with a big window sea view, my wife loved the bathroom & toiletries are very nice, we asked for extra & was given a selection my wife toke home.   The room chap was lovely & gave us some lovely chocolates free in our room, it was my birthday treat the hotel made me a cake surprisingly.
The Breakfast was lovely & evening meal, we were lucky we booked half Board free upgrade from B&B with our UK travel Agent.
It was a amazing hotel & staff lovely, nothing was to much trouble.
Thank you for a lovely memory & we our looking forward to stay with you for another 3 nights soon.  Dubai is a amazing place & we had a meal on a lovely boat in the creek we saw lovely boats & it's a very nice walk, recommend.
We would recommend the beach at the hotel as it's very nice & private, my wife had a perfect Mocktail Cooler on the beach as did I, We being English don't sunbath for long & it was very hot, My wife asked a butler if we could have a ice cream each & he brought to our sun bed,  We brought Marks & Spencer's tea bags (the have a M&S in the Burj visiting the Burj Kahlifa @ 124 as we visited friends at Al Hamra Golf Resort for a game,  I think it was a Hilton in RAK think its called 'Ras Al Kalma' about an hour drive away but a good road, watch the speed cameras, we saw Camels in RAK on the side road off the motorway  lol  🐪🐫🐪
All in all fantastic few days & like 8 star hotel with butlers was the nicest place we have stayed EVER, Much Much nicer than the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi.","5","2017-09"
"Amazing Experience!","We went to the Junsui restaurant for my 18th birthday, and It was the most wonderful experience. The staff were super attentive and kind, the chef was amazing, offering and serving us special signature dishes, the food was of excellent quality, much variety to choose from and I received such wonderful attention from the staff for my birthday, they brought me flowers, cake and a special desert, offer of the chef. An unforgettable experience really!","5","2018-06"
"Still great","Tried and true and iconic.
A must visit and even the food at the buffet is well done. The new pool area is great and private cabanas are a nice addition.
Some of the interior finish, carpets and fountains need an upgrade but this is still a hotel that takes the breath away and can be affordable. ","3","2018-06"
"Out of this world","This is the best hotel in the world. Although it is pricey it is definitely worth it. Perfect for honeymoon or for that special holiday to relax with first class service. You will not find this anywhere else in the world. I really enjoyed my luxurious holiday. ","5","2018-03"
"The most amazing hotel I had ever been ","Our hotel room was impeccable. The room was amazing it had a view from everywhere you looked we had a pool table, kitchen, living room a bar, another sitting room a bathroom and that was just downstairs. Upstairs was an office sitting room, bedroom and luxurious bathroom with a huge round bathtub. The Butler was very nice and the hostess was super sweet. The restaurants were amazing. It was an honor to stay at this hotel. I would most definitely return here!","5","2017-10"

Gym was too good..  better than Atlantis","5","2018-06"
"A Totally Unique Structure","This unique structure is often featured on postcards and is worth seeing in person -  is the case with quite a few places in Dubai. This is a site for travelers who enjoy photographing different architectural marvels. There are many photo-op positions from the beach that work well.  ","5","2018-06"
"Afternoon tea to dine for!!!","The best afternoon tea we have experienced so far!!!
We booked a table for the view and this didn't disappoint.
From the moment we arrived at the Burg Al Arab the staff treated us with the utmost respect and service was out of this world. 
We are not champagne drinkers so they brought us gold leaf infused non-alcoholic bubbles which was lovely.
If you can eat your way through the 7 courses then congratulations as we sure couldn't!
Unlimited coffee and numerous varieties of tea to delight all connoisseurs. 
We were celebrating our birthdays and I not only received a beautiful red rose but we were given yet another delicious birthday cake... 
Thank you once again to Reuben, our wonderful server, for such attentive service. 
Can't wait to return next time we visit Dubai!! ","5","2018-05"

Beautiful & luxurious rooms and bathrooms....Best staff... All staff were including butler Ms. Maria, Telly, and Aziz were very good....We give 95% marks to the hotel...only the thing to improve is the continental restaurant.... should include more items and also should have some Indian food on daily menu....Great hotel, great staff and great comfort....","5","2018-06"
"Best we ever stayed at","The Burj experience was the best i and my wife had for her 30th Bday surprise. It was everything we ever expected. 
Lovely, beautiful, and 7 star treatment from all the staffs. 
Will definitely visit again. ","5","2018-06"
"7 Star High Tea","This was the highlight of our visit to Dubai. To celebrate my birrthday and fathers day we booked a table in the Skyview Bar for High Tea. We arrived at the welcome centre to show our paperwork to allow us inside the perimiter. Then we were allowed past the security barrier to drive across the causeway to the entrance.

Met at the entrance we were shown inside the hotel the ground floor was very nice and the first opportunity to take a few photos. Then it is up the escalator to the first floor. Here you can see very nice restaurant and some very expensive shops, and you start to see more and more Gold Leaf.
If it looks like gold it will be gold. Even the caution wet floor sign is in gold leaf.

Walking along a highly decorated corridor you are greeted by a member of staff who checks your booking number and ushers you to a lift. Each booking has the lift to themselves.
When you reach the top floor you are again greeted by a member of staff who shows you to your table. The views from the Sky View Bar are amazing. When seated your waiter explains what is going to happen and pours a glass of champagne. As each of the seven courses comes to the table the waiter explains what is what on the display plates. During the session you are offered tea, coffee water or sodas or you can by more champagne at 140 AED per glass.

if you want more non alcoholic drinks they are all free. During the session the waiter offered to take photos for you and encouraged you to take as many of your own as you wanted.
I think staff came over to check everything was good several times during our tea.

As it was my birthday the waiter brought over a small Birthday cake with a candle, which was a nice gesture and wished me a very happy birthday.
You should go to the restroom even if you don't need too just to see the size and decore, even the tissue box bolder was gold plated.

when you session is over the hotel have a doggy bag of cakes that you did not manage to eat, nicely presented in a box or two.Then it's down in the lift and another look around and more photos as you make your way out.

Walk back across the causeway to get some lovely photographs, or ask someone to call you a taxi. We walked across as the exit is right by the Wild Wadi Water Park and there are lots of taxis available.

It was a fantastic afternoon, but beware when booking a visit. The price on various excursion sites can be very expensive. Book direct with the Burj Al Arab site and you get it about half the price of the excursion sites. Don.t let the other sites try and justify their prices by saying they will provide the transport. Taxis are not expensive in Dubai if you use the government taxis with the coloured tops.

It is a once in a life time visit unless you have a lot of spare cash or about £900-00 per person per night to stay in one of the 202 suites.","5","2018-06"
"Family Friendly Luxury ","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab with our two youngest children (3 years and 18 month old). The service was outstanding and the staff treated our children like a prince and princess, in fact our 3 year old asked if we could stay forever. Our suite was spotless and had everything we could have asked for. The butler service was extremely professional and requests were responded to promptly, nothing was too much trouble. Dining was excellent and our children well catered for, with gifts such as soft toys and sweets (candy) offered. Given the heat we made use to the cabanas, this worked really well for the children who were able to take a nap in the air conditioned environment and watch kids programmes on the TV when they weren’t in the pool. Again, service to our cabana was excellent and the staff made a fuss of the children bringing them pool toys to play with. The Burj Al Arab is a fantastic hotel that we would strongly recommend, all the staff made it a memorable stay for adults and children alike. We’ll definitely visit again in the not too distant future. Thank you to all the staff for our wonderful experience during our stay. 10/10.","5","2018-06"
"VACATION","great service, beautiful hotel, friendly staff, well maintained property, great location, 6 class hotel, rooms beautiful, location central to get around Dubai, and will come back if we are in Dubai again ","5","2018-06"
"But it is Burj Al Arab...","Super friendly, super clean (super expensieve as well), but at the same time strange kind of kitsch... The infinity pool is magnificent, the view is perfect, the staff treats you like a king/queen and food and coctails are tasty. The reception area design can be improved...","4","2018-06"
"Holiday","An absolute experience of a lifetime the service what can I say your treated like royalty. The attention to detail is out of this world. Dining extroadinary can’t fault it, the suites absolutely amazing a must do while in Dubai","5","2018-06"
"Super Long Eid Wekend at Burj Al Arab","A very special stay at a very special hotel.  From arrival and check in at our suite, we were made to feel superbly welcome.  The entire staff were welcoming and friendly and quite prepared to go the extra mile.  Superb food, wonderful drinks and great ambience. Great spa experience and lots of relaxing in an unexpectedly good beach. The only negative was the Sinbad's Kids club.  It felt like an afterthought and didn't live up to the expectations from the rest of the hotel. More a holding pen for children than somewhere they could have fun. No criticism of the staff who were lovely. The facility more resembled a cupboard than a club.  Hence our daughter spent more time outside of the hotel in the other Jumeira hotel facilities.  Will definitely go back, but n this experience without child. Definitely felt more of an adult destination than a family destination.","5","2018-06"
"Start the night with cocktails in the bar on the top floor . Dress to impress","Start the night with cocktails in the bar on the top floor. Amazing diversity in cocktail offering .Visually and taste 

Finish the night with dinner with the Aquarium as a backdrop. Its a special night out and will be a highlight of your trip","5","2018-05"
"Dinner at Burj Al Arab","Absolutely stunning.  Service is superb and above and beyond   Hotel amazing and beautiful. Dinner was great and bar at the top has a great view and better than average drinks.  Hotel is beautiful and location superb ","5","2018-06"
"Lives upto it’s Name","The memories we had there have just as majestic place in our hearts as the Burj Al Arab itself. Firsts have to special and this certainly was. Everything from service, ambiance to those yummy fries at Escape Lounge were exquisite. 
Definitely going for seconds!","5","2018-04"
"Gold on 27","The bar is magical .. the views are stunning and the service is perfect but the drinks are another story .. something from heaven
Reserve before you go 
You can dance to the beats 
Wait till the lights are dimmed and see the magic","5","2017-07"
"Sky View Bar - High Tea","The Sky View Bar High Tea was recommended to us by friends from Belgium. The experience of visitnig the Burj Al Arab was excellent in itself. (you can't get past the gate without a reservation) The trip to the 27th floor was great in the mainly glass lift. We had window seats which I would highly recommend for the few extra Dirham. The high tea was an experience - superb service and outstanding food. The food was plentiful and certainly a challenge to complete all the courses, even though it was just afternoon tea!!
Loved it!! Highly recommend Sky View Bar High Tea. ","5","2018-05"
"Remortgage you house :)","I am not a millionaire - Or even a Hundredaire at the moment looking at my bank balance. Sad face! So to go here was once in a lifetime - unless I win the lottery?

The pinnacle of service and luxury even at the cheaper end (Still very very very  expensive to us mere peasants)

From start to finish this hotel offers you the best of the best. They would fly in a steak from Paris for you and still manage to be quicker than any train service in the UK.

The thing that stick out is not the views or the building but is the service by the staff. They work hard to make your stay the best as possible - Hats off to them!","5","2018-02"
"Amazing atmosphere"," The hotel is perfect from inside and out. I had a chance to visit this place but did not enter the building. So cannot comment on services or luxury inside.
But the view on the driveway to and around is really awesome. There are always few things/objects that we inspire more when seen from a distance ","5","2017-08"
"George","Ultimative Hotel experience. Prefect from A-Z. Beautiful building on a perfect location. Nice private beach and other hotel services. The suite perfect, well equipped. Just the tv is not in the same league as all the other amenities.","5","2018-06"

"Captivating!!!","I stayed in this hotel for work - from the minute I set my eyes on this place it was just mind blowing!! The rooms are a masterpiece I even had my own butler!! This hotel being a 7 star speaks for itself it is incredible - the staff and the service was out of this world!! This hotel is in a league of its own!!","5","2017-07"
"Extremely over priced ","We had dinner in the restaurant, it’s very warm with all the glass around you , 
The service was average , the food was very nice but so overpriced . A bottle of cloudy bay Cost over $300 Australian .
Good experience but wouldn’t go again .

"MRS VANESSA WILLIAM","Burj Arab Jumeirah is the most luxurious place we have ever stayed in. The staff are so friendly & the service is impeccable. The facilities are amazing & better then we have ever experienced. The 
restaurant are very expensive but the very best in the world. I would advise to get the package that  include breakfast & dinner which we got through Luxury Escape, that would make it more affordable
 & enjoyable . 

","5","2018-06"
"Part of our curiocity","This hotel was labelled 7 star, The highest rated Hotel in the world thus our curiocity was elevated so high too that even high cost to visit the hotel was set aside.  The cost either to eat in the top floor (27th Floor) Restaurant of the Hotel or check-in  in the hotel.  The answer to the curiosity is the hotel is Gold Plated or covered with 24karat Gold. The column post, the wall and even the toilet is covered with Gold a very unique hotel in some degree.  The place is sitting beside the beach thus another plus for the hotel.  Cost per night is AED 7530 or$2121/night or PHP112,950/night This is very costly that only very rich people can afford to stay.  The other option to see the interior part of the hotel is to eat at Al Muntahan Restaurant. A very expensive place to eat a dinner but much cheaper compare to one night stay in the hotel..A minimum of $150/person to eat a dinner. The inexpensive white wine for one glass cost AED115 or $32.40.  This cost can buy 4 or more bottles already.","5","2018-06"
"fantastic stay","after 2 years from a previous visit I thought I would try the Burj again the new pool rea was amazing and so was the staff definitely will go back soon there was talk that it will be re furbished soon which would be great as the rooms have not changed since I was last year.Bit of a shame Jumeirah beach was closed a spolit the atmosphere r beach etc","5","2018-06"
"Opulence + Grandeur Defined at the Burj al Arab!","I've stayed at the Burj twice now, 1st time I was upgraded + the 2nd time it was just as captivating. The lack of a balcony or terrace does not come to mind when you enter their suites as there is so much internal space over 2 floors. The decoration, furniture, fittings, accessories, bath robes, slippers + Hermes toiletries + perfumes put a spell on you instantly to just enjoy + enjoy this precious time + fabulous gift for your memory box! Loved it here, the breakfast wasn't the best I've had in Dubai but very special in its own right. The breakfast is an intimate area quite small but very good food + drink. Service staff throughout are meticulously trained in customer service + rightly so when you spend that price per night you expect some of the money to invest in the staff as that's who make this place too. Some of the most fabulous photos to take as everything that catches your eye demands to be shot with the lens. Love the Burj, the sky bar is cool too + your own mixologist at your table is a nice touch too! Great entertaining space + place if you have friends/family in Dubai + definately the place to book for a special occasion! ","5","2017-07"
"1st birthday celebration for all of us","we booked the stay at Burj for the weekend as we wanted to experience something different, it was our son 1st birthday as we wanted to chill out and experience a touch of luxury.  we arrived at 11:00 am knowing check- in is not untill the afternoon, they stored our luggage and we had lunch and chilled at the pool.   When the room was ready one of members came to get us to inform our room was ready and we went to the room and we were staying in 2303, the room was a one bedroom duplex, it was amazing the view and bathroom was the highlight of the room. the hotel amenities were wow.. got a hermes perfume added to my collection ( full size ).  we spent most of our time by the pool, the service by the pool bar and staff was exceptional. always checking on my son and giving him fruit and water.  the in dinning room menu had amazing choice of food.  we were put off with the Arabic restaurant being a buffet as we are vegetarian.  overall stay was amazing... and would do it again if the price was correct.","5","2018-04"
"returning customer","Have stayed at the Burj twice, the first time we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite . Stunning suites and a butler at your beckon call. Breakfast was a bit limited not as good or big as other jumeriah beach hotels . Bathroom freebies were hermes perfumes and shower necessities etc. On checking out to the Dar al Masyaf we were kept waiting for about 30 minutes , not a problem they gave us tea and dates but to make up for their delay in the transfer they upgraded us to white phantom rolls Royce, Where else would you receive that kind of service. Amazing experience, expensive yes but worth every penny.","5","2017-07"

"A Master Piece","With a special arrangement, we have a tour in this hotel of high Secuirty. It is not opened for public visitors unless you have booking of one of the suite. They only have suite not room. We have the privileged to visit to the top presidential floors and view the gulf and watch the Dubai city from a distant and palm island. I must say it is worth to visit this hotel, although it is not cheap . Take advantage of any special in a package. If you watch the series of engineering connection by Richard Hammond before , you will be amazed by this building in design. Building on sand, the water fountains, the revolving door entrance, high speed escalator at 11m per sec. however it was not a too “vow “effect when get in the lobby. It is big but .. the water fountain at the lobby is amazing in using a laminated flow physics . There are a lot of columns and door frame are gold leaf plated. It does not look shinny as paint in texture because it is pressed with real gold leaves. Their staff are so professional, friendly and respect to all visitors disregard what you dress and wear on your feet. Once you are the inside customers, you are treated. There are different softness of pillows for chosen in every suite. The facilities of each suite is elegantly placed. The top floor gulf view restaurant is big, like other large revolving restaurant which I have visited before. The shops are , of course , the top brands of the world. This is a high Secuirty hotel. Suggested to watch the engineering connection video of this hotel before your visit will definitely help you to enjoy not just the luxury, also the amazing building and architecture. 👍","5","2018-05"

"A Royal Place outside your home","Once you pass security one feels like one has entered another world. It is magical. The food is great. The staff are exceptional & always more than ready to make sure you are treated right. One feels secure with so many people around to make sure of it. 
For our family it was like a dream. We ended our trip here & could not have hoped for anything better. The meaning of good quality can be totally understood & experienced here. 
Undoubtedly we are all kings & queens of our homes but to feel like royalty outside your home is very rare. We got this here. ","5","2018-05"
"Burj Al Arab stay","An outstanding overall family experience with plenty of attention to detail. Although we stayed overnight only, we were able to enjoy the facilities, best part being the Terrace pool and the restaurants.","5","2018-06"
""" A Very Very Special Place""","This trip was for my husbands 70th Birthday and wow wow wow.... picked up in the Rolls Royce early morning and delighted that our suite was ready. Vivek our butler unpacked while we enjoyed a fabulous breakfast in Bam Al Yam. The hotel was looking amazing as always. We had family with us who were blown away by the whole experience. We had a wonderful day on his birthday and had the use of a Royal Cabana with the staff providing him with a cake and some champagne so thanks to Marawan and Lourdes who looked after us at the pool everyday. In the evening Cynthia and Albin and the team surprised him with the famous ""Singing Butlers"" and he felt like royalty once again. Some people think its a bit over the top but believe me its just a special hotel with AMAZING staff. The florist made a wonderful job as did housekeeping. I have to also thank Anthony another butler for helping me pack....he makes a wonderful job. Last but not least try the spa as Cora is the lady who makes me look and feel good each visit. Thank you to ALL the staff who made his special birthday truly memorable and yes of course we will be back BAA......","5","2018-05"
"A landmark of Dubai","Best place to visit in Dubai . A man made monument in sea. Best carving done from inside in golden. A monument in the sea were u can enjoy the fresh air and sea water from the beaches. Great place for families","5","2017-08"
"Worth the experience at least once. Soak in the luxury.","1. Appearance - The overall structure looks awasome from outside. However the entry from the bridge and the exterior of hotel entrance is very average for a seven star hotel. The interior is exotic in terms of lavishness full of gold colour. At certain places the colours appear too bold and bright. 
2. Service - The maintenance and house keeping is impeccable. Toiletries are high class and there are amenities from Hermes.  The rooms are huge and plush. Beds are super comfortable. The butler service is variable. Some butlers acted as if they were our long time friends and guided us for our choices. Our very pleasant stay was however marred by the behaviiour of one butler. We had asked for possibility of 2pm check out which was denied and I am perfectly OK with that. However unlike what was promised by the previous butlers this one was not willing to let us visit the indoor pool even for few minutes. Since we had missed visiting it during our stay we wanted to just view it. The butler even said something strange like - ""There may be other people there and they may not like your going there"". I do not know what that meant. The butler then showed some willingness to allow us with some riders. By that time we were so put off by his behavior that we left without visiting the pool. This is an example of how 50 people's job can be spoiled by one.
The experience on the terrace pool was quite enjoyable with very attentive staff. The buggy service to go to the beach was prompt and the facilities at the beach were excellent.
Restaurants: Good experience with the breakfast. I will review the restaurants separately.","5","2018-05"
"Gold on 27","We had cocktails in gold on 27 cocktail bar  it was truly an experience we will remember for a long time. Purely luxurious surroundings attentive waiter unbelievable cocktails and nibbles as well. We'll will be back one day.","5","2018-02"
"Extravagent is the only word","On the special occasions that you stay in the best hotels in the world, it's usually refined service and quality of the product that make it special.

At the Burj Al Arab, the wow comes from the excessive nature of the suites, amenities and the look and feel of the facilities.

The butler service is pleasant. Staff are eager to please whereas in Europe a butler would offer a more refined approach.

On arrival we were taken to our non smoking suite, yet the previous occupants had clearly been smoking in it. We asked to move and staff took us immediately to another room. They were a little embarrassed especially as the replacement suite hadn't been set up for our arrival. There was a bit of running about by the butlers, housekeeping and receptionist for 15 minutes to get everything sorted.  This didn't create the best first impression however they soon made up for it. The butler brought welcome drinks to the room, packed a beach bag for us to take to the pool and arranged a birthday cake.

We struggled to get a table for dinner when we requested it for arrival however this was resolved by meal time. It didn't feel like the hotel had reserved sufficient tables for in house guests (I had also tried to book by phone in advance and told to ask the butler when we arrived).

What I like:
- the toiletries
- the size of the room
- eagerness of staff to please

What I'd like to see more of if I come back for a 4th visit:
- innovation. A few years ago they were trialling gold ipads in the suites. This has gone and the old remote controls are being used. If ipads don't fit in, then an Amazon echo or other voice controlled device for the room would be good
- wifi speed in the suites and on the iMac were slow
- keeping the amenities. The men's eau du toilette size has reduced from 100ml to 50ml and you don't get deodorant 
- checking the finer detail before a guest arrives including the requests made on the pre-emailed request that the hotel sent a week before and that the room is definitely non smoking.

If the whole experience was based on being slick end to end, I'd give this trip four out of five. It is the eagerness of staff that make me give it the five out of five.","5","2018-06"
"Still has the wow factor Part 1","Decided to surprise my girlfriend to a cocktail evening at the top of the Burj.
We booked while staying at the Mina  A Salam hotel ( Jumeirah) and decided it would be lovely to treat her with the stunning views on offer.

This first part is the trip inside. Part two is of the cocktails we drank.
The total cost was around £170 in English money ( around $230 dollars) 

You have to dress decently for this event and wear shirt trousers and shoes for the man. The woman can dress sophicasted or as simple but not t shirt and shorts.

We picked up the buggy form reception at our hotel and decided to get off along the bridge and walk the extra 100 metres to take photos. 
It's a nice setting so make sure you do it around dusk.

Once inside..It still has the wow factor with some expensive shops and some elegant restuarants too! 

But today we are reviewing the cocktail bar.....in Part 2","5","2018-05"
"Very special experience!","We stayed here about 10 years ago and although it hasn't changed a lot, this hotel is still a very special place. We were made to feel special from the moment we walked in the door. I absolutely love the decor, opulent rich colours all around. 
The staff were all attentive and very friendly from the doormen to the butlers. You are always made to feel like a VIP.  
The new pool area is a fantastic addition. There are 2 pools, one a saltwater infinity pool looking out on the Persian Gulf. 
There are plenty of restaurants and bars and you don't have to leave the building. The other Jumeirah hotels are just a short buggy ride away, as is the fabulous beach, the whole complex is beautiful! 

All in all, staying at the Burj is an incredible experience! Hope we get the opportunity to do it again!","5","2018-05"
"Fit for a Queen!","I stayed at Burj for my birthday and it was a luxurious experience beyond anything I have ever seen. I arrived in the Rolls Royce to everyone awaiting my arrival. Everyone was extremely attentive and knew the needs each guests. The room was VERY well appointed and had everything you wanted and needed for your stay. I love the spa and pool facilities. The dining options were fantastic. Truly in a class of its own.  ","5","2018-05"
"High Tea","A must do in Dubai is high tea at the Buru.Six stars for service, food and views. Bookings are necessary and do so as early as you can as it sometimes difficult to get a booking.The whole experience was amazing!","5","2017-08"
"Room without a view!!!!","We were very excited to be staying in a deluxe suite at this exclusive hotel. We paid for a sea view. However, unfortunately the electric curtains and tv broke in the bedroom around 10pm on our first night. 

So as not to wake the sleeping children, we waited until first light to call for assistance.

Despite the butler attempting to fix and promising IT would attend at 8am to fix it, the problem was not resolved (until we were about to leave our room, around 12.30). 

We had asked our butler three times to fix, and we called main reception to complain when we went for breakfast -hoping they would fix it before our return. After we went out again to the pool to discover it still broken, we called the manager. 

She simply offered us food and drink- how does this compensate for the loss of what you come here to see?... the view!
 
I felt exceptionally cheated. I planned my morning sipping coffee in bed reading the paper and admiring the view... but alas this was not to be.😢 I couldn’t even watch any TV in bed the night before.

Indeed, the service on the whole was pretty shocking for an exclusive hotel (with the exception of breakfast).

Other problems we experienced: 

Tap fell off in the shower- maintenance came to fix, and walked in on me, in my bedclothes, without even knocking on the door!

Jacuzzi hadn’t been cleaned, and upon filling and turning on, it pumped out brown scum into the bath. Yuck! Then the plug wouldn’t work after I cleaned it out- so I gave up!

We asked for the room to be serviced. All dirty dishes were piled up on the table and left for the duration of our stay. I got fed up of looking at them, and in the end had to put them myself outside our room. I even had to clean my own cups, to have a cup of tea the next day, as no clean ones had been supplied.

My daughters hair turned green from one of the pools, due to incorrect chlorine.

The sofa cushions in the downstairs floor on one side were so worn it felt like you were sitting only on a plank of wood.

All in all, not the experience we were expecting. Poor service, no view and defective room.

Positives: Hotel has lovely architecture, and friendly pool and breakfast staff. Nice full size Hermes toiletries.

However, overall I feel exceptional disappointment in this experience, indeed I feel cheated of the luxury experience I expected!

","2","2018-05"
"Panoramic suite was one of the highlights of our short trip to Dubai.","So this stay was a bit of a ""once in a lifetime type of opportunity"" because who knows if we will go back to Dubai again and this was our indulgence and boy o boy were we not disappointed.

We literally did not want to leave the room, the panorama suite offered us views that we never get tired of, the suite itself was amazing I don't know how I can describe everything that was in the suite.

2 floors, an iMac all setup with internet connection ready to go and a desk. Full bathroom downstairs with 2 sinks, 2 lounges and a massive corner lounge. Huge TV and dining area for breakfast. Upstairs, massive main bathroom with incredible shower and spa and double sinks. Huge storage area for clothes and luggage.

Do you pay a lot to stay here, yes you do and nothing is really cheap but it doesn't mean you have to do anything there or even have dinner there but we did as it just added to the experience.

The full breakfast that you get is incredible and you can keep going on it well into lunch as we did it was just so huge with really amazing food.

You get fresh fruit restocked each day and an apple/date sparkling wine on arrival, dates and boxed local pastries as well.

You also get a collection of men/ladies toiletries which are yours to keep and use after you leave the hotel.

On to the best part of the hotel for me! I use the gym a lot when I go on holiday and this is without doubt the most incredible gym I have ever been to! The equipment is state of the art, the bikes which I use, or quiet have full access to TV and other streaming services you get headphones/water/towel and cold compress given to you while you are doing your workout as you look out of the gym on the 18th floor to amazing views. Combine this with the change areas that have a showers, saunas, plunge pool and full service within from an attendant, including a spin dry machine so you can rinse your workout clothes in the water and then get them dried in 30 seconds and there is a pool close by to for an almost infinity view out of the pool.

The out door pools are great and one has a very good infinity setup with spas and the other pool has a swim up bar, large amount of chairs and great service while you are sat down for drinks, including cold water given to you when you arrive.

Do you pay a lot for a stay here, did the staff and our butlers go out of their way to make our visit memorable my word they did, nothing was too much trouble.

If you are after a highlight stay then I would highly recommend it, could there be slightly cheaper places to stay with a similar level of service, yes, probably but they are not the Burj Al Arab with the view and the location.

We also visited the other hotel close by with access to the beach which we had access to and had we stayed longer you also get access to the Water Park of the other resort close by.","5","2018-05"

"OLD AND SERVICE OVERRATED!!!!!!!! NOT A 7-STAR HOTEL!!!!!","Very OLD rooms and facilities, with a lot of RUST around (see attached pictures).

Only one shower in a suite for multiple people.

NO TECHNOLOGY AT ALL IN THE ROOM! Very very old style!!!
No USB or Universal power plugs. ZERO!

No Fresh Fruit Juices for breakfast (they are mixing a small fresh portion with a lot of package juice and the result is terrible!)

Dirty pillows and other things around. TERRIBLE!!!!! NOT A 7-STAR HOTEL!!!

There are much better places to stay in Dubai, with better services and lower costs (e.g. Shangri-La, Ritz Carlton, Fairmont, etc.)","1","2018-05"
"Wow! Ostentatious gone mad","You need a reservation to enter the Burj al Arab and as we only wanted to visit the Skyview Bar we just booked in for drinks. Beware they are super expensive but it is worth it to sit and take in the view as the sun sets over Dubai and all the lights across the city come alive. Definitely a must do and I'm so glad we did.","5","2018-05"
"Family Holiday ","My 2nd visit to the Burj Al Arab but this time with family and WOW again blown away by the quality and level of service.

Having requested our original Butler Aldrin for the stay he was again superb. It feels like I’m coming to meet a family friend. My children and parents loved him and the brilliant service he gave.

Will we be returning? 100% yes, hard to consider another hotel with service this good.

A massive thank you to all hotel staff for making our stay so special. A great holiday and many amazing memories.","5","2018-05"
"Surprise Birthday Treat","As you would expect. First class hotel. First class service. Expensive 4 day break but you get what you pay for.
Only disappointment was I told the hotel we were celebrating my wife's birthday. They said in the email they had arranged a special treat. I was told the same at check-in yet nothing happened. Never mind. It certainly didn't ruin the experience.","5","2018-05"
"Amazing !","This hotel is first class in every possible way.  The staff is so attentive to every detail into making your stay as amazing as they possibly can.  Make sure you go to the teatime upstairs because it is totally first class and you will see an amazing view of everything from up there","5","2017-07"
"Bucket List Staycation","What a great opportunity to stay at the Burj al Arab! We received 25% off during Ramadan, but the cost was still 4700 AED after taxes, including breakfast. However, the service, amenities, and extras were well worth the price. We had the panoramic room, with beautiful views of the Palm and Dubai. The pool was fantastic, breakfast delicious, and the butler service amazing. You can even get a bubble bath drawn in your jacuzzi at 3am! :) If we can afford it again, we will definitely be back. In your suite you get a full Hermes toiletries set, including a bottle of perfume for ladies and cologne for men. All the little extras made our trip unforgettable. ","5","2018-05"
"A 7stars hotel? It is not even a 4...Stay Away!","We had this wonderful idea to spend our Holidays at Burj Al Arab in Dubai. Well.. a 7 stars hotel? I am sorry it is not even a 4 stars. Very old rooms and facilities. 
Let me document everything here for you to avoid wasting your money over there: 
When you arrive at the check-in there is not a welcome. You have to go at the counter, they ask for the IDs and then they pretend you to wait forever for the room without telling you anything for hours. They do not even tell you or call you when the room is finally available which is not acceptable not even for a 2 stars hotel. 

The rooms are very old style. For example:
Only one shower in a suite for multiple people. The shampoo provided in the room is more similar to a glue and not to a product you can use to wash yourself. The shower is the oldest style possible. Do not expect to enjoy a Chromotherapy shower or a modern massaging shower, because the shower is absolutely ridiculous. 
Zero technology in the room, but I am not referring to high technology, not even the basics. There is not a USB plug to recharge your devices in the entire room. No air-play. NO Keyless Entry. NO personalized Tv screen upon entry. NO docking station. No Mirror TV. Lighting and climate control impossible to set them remotely. 
The sockets are only for locals, they do not provide international plugs in a hotel for tourists, how weird. Ah.. and of course no sockets available to recharge your phone near the bed. Zero Convenient power sources. You have to dive under a desk to access power sockets to connect and charge your devices. 
Zero extra-blanket in the room. If you have an emergency, for example you need a pad/tampon or a band aid they asked you to pay the relief pack which is around 160 AED. What? In a 7 stars hotel (and for the price you pay per night) you have to pay for a band-aid? 
Breakfast: well… they pretend you are not able to distinguish between a fresh-fruit juice and a chemical one. The breakfast quality is no that good as it is supposed to be. 
At the pool: 
-The pools are full of rust, see pictures attached 
-They provide water at the pool in very dirty bags, see picture attached
-The pillows at the pools are also very dirty, see picture attached 
-There is no a no-smoking area at the pool, so they are basically ok to make their guests sick. Even if you ask to be in a no-smoking area they do not care at all. 
-There is no toilet at the pool, you have to go back inside the hotel to find a toilet… very inconvenient
-The plants are all dry and arid, see picture attached

In other words, zero value for money over there. You  will not feel special at all. Stay away. They have a lot to learn for example from six senses zighy bay, or from Shangri-La or Conrad or from Waldorf Astoria and Fairmont.","1","2018-05"
"Antonio Mas Perez","What can you say about this hotel that has not been said before? It is the best hotel in the world, with an unbeateable situation, excelent food, fantastic service, beutifull and confortable suits with lovely views, luxury features all round, you really fell like a king in this place. Expensive, but worth every penny. Is an experience, that everyone should have at least once in a lifetime. More if you can afford it.","5","2018-05"
"Not as it was","We spend a few days at Burj al arab, not our first time there and not our first time in jumeirahs hotels. It is still nice but the service is not as good as it used to be. They are to busy with the huge buses of Asian customers arriving for one night to look after their other clients maybe...","4","2018-05"
"great stay but has service has slightly declined since last time","We stayed here for our honeymoon last year and our stay was so perfect that we had worries about coming here again incase it wasn't as good as before and spoilt our memories from before. 

After much debate we decided to go back. We booked the rolls royce as I believe that is the only way to travel there.... upon arrival we wasn't greeted in the same way as before. There was one lady there with a cold towel where as before there was a whole line of people with coffee... dates towels etc etc. 

The lady with the cold towels was lovely though and guided us to the room. To be fair to them they let us check in at 8am which is really good of them considering check in time is 3pm.

The butlers helped with the bags but on this occasion they did not show us around the room and explain anything like before. Maybe they presumed I knew everything from our previous visit but it was 16 months ago and I had forgotten how to operate the curtains etc.

I also felt like their knowledge of the hotel wasn't up to date.... I was misinformed about the breakfast timings... they told me it finished at 10.30 in bab al yam but infact finishes at 11.30. There were several other occasions that I was given false information also.

Before when I stayed the butlers called the elevator for you, and also opened your suite door when they saw you coming back. This didn't happen this time. 

The butlers did not do a bad job just not the same as before...

The pool area was really nice... peaceful and relaxing. The dinner in Al awan was good the breakfast was really nice but some items a little cold. 

All in all I would stay again as it is a wonderful experience","4","2018-05"

"Outstanding hotel and service","We decided to stay at Burj Al Arab aswe had been working in the UAE for a number of years and are due to leave and this was on our bucket list.  Having stayed in a number of top class and renowned hotels around the world i can honestly say this surpassed them all.  We booked a panoramic suite, which is well worth it, unbelievable floor to ceiling views over a huge duplex apartment. There were a number of complimentary items including full size Hermes fragrances for male and female plus associated toiletries etc. No detail was overlooked, at turn down service more complimentary gifts were left and also roses on the bed. We had breakfast on the first morning in Junsui the asian restaurant, the food was very good although not sure green curry for breakfast is something I would do every day but it is what we expected and was different. The service was excellent and our waiter engaged with us and asked us about our stay etc.  Later in the day when we returned to our room there was a card and a glass engaged Burj Al Arab ornament from the Junsui staff as a reminder of our time in the UAE, this was totally unexpected and a lovely touch.  That day we did the Abra boat tour and then to the pool where once again nothing could be faulted, iced towels, iced complimentary fruit juice, cool bag with water which was swapped every hour.  The following morning we decided to try in room breakfast and take advantage of our views, the breakfast turned up on time and was huge and absolutely gorgeous.  Check in and check was simple and painless and the luggage and valet service were the best i have experienced, on the day we left we had four people at the car to ensure everything was ok.  To summarize, if you want to experience a beautiful hotel with totally outstanding service you have to visit the Burj Al Arab!","5","2018-05"
"Burj Al Arab","We booked the 3 Bedroom Diplomatic Suite but unfortunately it wasn´t available when we arrived at the hotel and we have received a lower service than we booked.
The Burj Al Arab give us a extra bed in the salon. Very bad! :(","3","2018-03"
"Undoubtedly The Most Luxurious","Stayed a night with family for our marriage anniversary in a Club Suite with panoramic view.
There is nothing I can add about the suite. It’s really the most luxurious hotel in the world. And it’s an experience we will cherish throughout our life.
The only minor glitch I would highlight is that they forgot the anniversary cake during the occasion.
However they handed it to us during checkout the next day. This wasn’t Burj Al Arab standard.
Will surely return.

I’ve not been to every hotel in the world, of course, but this hotel must rank among the most beautiful... and most expensive in the world.  We did not spend a night in the hotel, but we only had lunch there... a VERY expensive lunch at that... but well worth the price.  We even got to ride back to our ship in one of their three GORGEOUS chauffeur-driven white ROLLS ROYCES!  That was expensive also... but was money well spent for this ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME experience!!!

"Incredible hotel with exceptional service..but","Fantastic hotel with great service and phenomenal rooms. We stayed in a two story two bedroom suite that is bigger than most houses.The views are as you would imagine and the suite would accommodate a party for 50 or more people if you desired.

The butler , the car service the ambience is all  wonderful. A place that you really need to stay at least once in your life. Our suite would be the perfect place for major business meetings or a family group with multiple living areas and even a full kitchen.

The but is this is truly an expensive option and it is not within walking distance of anything outside of the Jumeirah resort area.

And you have to wonder why the TV in the bedrooms (which is a wonderful size) is right in the middle of the view!!

If you are looking for the best hotel secluded away from the masses this must be it. If you are looking for a base in Dubai to explore the tourist attractions then possibly not.

I will definatley come back when next in the UAE.","5","2018-05"

This hotel is soooo luxurious and prestigious.

The rooms are incredible, 2 floors in each room with a massive staircase. A bar, Apple computer, massive hot tub.

We had the panoramic view so the views was a bit of everything!! City, beach..spectacular!

Everything about this hotel has such fine and expensive materials.

"Afternoon tea at The Burj","It has taken me awhile to write this review and the reason for doing it now is because I am thinking of going back.

We visited Dubai and stayed at the Sofitel on the Palm but wanted to experience afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab.

I have been to Dubai several times and up to this point had only been in to the lobby of the Burj. So on our next trip we decided to eat there.

The experience of the day was fabulous. We had a good look around the hotel first in the areas we were allowed then went up to the skyview bar.

The food and drinks were delicious. The service was excellent and it was a pleasure to go. We were there for around two hours and left satisfied.

I am returning to Dubai in September and was wondering if I should go again. The price has increased slightly to 650 dirhams per person which is around £130 each. So I think I'm going to have to give it some thought.","5","2017-06"
"Disappointing from an Iconic hotel","They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression...this first impression was poor...confused staff, no butlers to check you in , no communication as my 17 guests were left waiting and becoming more and more frustrated. Restaurants great, staff helpful once check in disaster was over- you couldn't help feeling like the staff thought you were doing them a favour staying at the hotel. Surely 7 stars should know how to make guests feel comfortable. Hoepfully we can go back someday and have a better experience it probably should deserve.","2","2018-04"
"Gold on 27 ... Sublime","What more perfect way to end a day in the fascinating and breathtaking city of Dubai than by having cocktails and nibbles in the 'Gold on 27' bar in the Burj al Arab, overlooking the Palm and the city as the sun sets and the city begins to twinkle with night lights. Having passed through the various understandably high-security checkpoints to reach the hotel (one can't visit even for a drink without a confirmed reservation) we entered the foyer with clever flowing water features and sheer elegance and extravagance ... one feels one has arrived to sheer luxury here. We enjoyed a quiet wander around the stunningly beautiful pool area and checked out some of the other bars and restaurants for future reference. We had hoped to visit the 'underwater' restaurant but a rather autocratic and, disappointingly, somewhat condescending member of staff wouldn't permit us which was surprising given that I was in a very elegant long black dress, Chanel handbag and expensively bejewelled and my husband was also very smartly dressed in a blazer, long trousers etc despite the heat (as we know from experience befits a luxury hotel) and, despite explaining we were considering booking to dine there for an upcoming celebration, she still refused us entry - not the most welcoming service from that particular member of staff! The Gold bar is, as one would expect - decadent, luxurious and very very gold ... even all the fitments in the WC are gold. We were delighted to be the only customers for a while - very romantic in the dim  ambient lighting. The cocktails were unique and superb, beautifully decorated and the light bites we ordered we perfectly unusual too. Prices are very high but it's expected in a place of such quality and understandably so given the clientele.The bar staff were lovely - very attentive, discreetly friendly and helpful. The only disappointment in the Gold bar was noticing that a couple of customers had been allowed in even though they hadnt observed/respected the dress code ... they wore shorts and shirts which werent smart which lowered the tone and understandably irritated my husband who was respectfully suffering the heat in long trousers and a long sleeved shirt. They would have been refused entry in the Ritz, London so it was indeed a shame to see here. Nevertheless, top marks to Burj for decor, exclusivity and decadence.","5","2017-11"
"A piece of Art","What a beautiful place, we truly had a good time in Dubai. The view, the cleanliness and the scenery . I will definitely visit again. The kids enjoyed it and it was very safe we can have a peace of mind while shopping","5","2017-06"
"Best indeed","Burj Al Arab is always extraordinary experience. Nothing compares to this hotel. No matter if you come to stay weekend or just for dinner - it is always memorable and special and always can surprise by offering something new","5","2018-05"
"No doubt it’s gets the rating and reputation for best hotel in the world. Amazing experience!!!","If only the prices were a little more resonable could revisit more often and bring children along. Other than that,
Truly recommend everyone who can to visit at least once in a lifetime, well worth it. ","5","2018-04"
"Iconic Experience - Needs refurb/update","This was our last stop of our Honeymoon trip from Sri Lanka and Maldives. My husband booked it as a surprise as he knew I always talk about this hotel being an icon within the hospitality industry and to the location. This was the first 7star hotel in the world, back in late 90’s and built in a man-made island.
The staff was very friendly and helpful. Bashir and Patricia/Gabriela (? from Mexico), our butlers, are great assets to this hotel. They assisted us every day.

Room: 
We booked a Deluxe One Bedroom Suite, which is huge! It had a view to the Dubai Marina. The turndown service was on point on the first night, the second one wasn’t done so I had to call and request it and they came quickly. The room was cleaned as soon as we left for breakfast every day and spotless. The toiletries and room amenities are great, all Hermes.
The bed's mattress wasn't comfortable, I didn't get the impression it was very new.
The ac, lights, curtains can be controlled by remote control or individually at each room, not iPad or any newer control system.

Dining Experience: 
Food overall is great. Presentation, variety, quality. 
Breakfast is a la carte, and the rest of the menu is great, containing all western, indian and asian items to choose from.
We had daily breakfast at Bab Al Yam (great variety but I was expecting more) and dinner at Jun Sui (huge assortment and great quality+ service).
Al Muntaha: great food and service. Looks very 90’s.

Recommendations:
Needs rooms update, refurbishment. For the rates you pay, more is expected and newer modern entertainment/TV/Audio/AC amenities. 
The carpets, sofas feel and look dated, from the 90’s. The staff Uniforms for the butlers and receptionists look costumey, very 90’s.
With so many hotels opening and so much competition in Dubai, I was surprised this hotel didn’t feel was keeping up with the changes for the modern traveler.

Pro’s:
Lots of dining/restaurants to choose from.
Good shopping/jewelry offerings on site.
Very Friendly staff.
The buggies can take you around the other sister hotels, complimentary and they run very minute!
Water Park entry is included!
Great room toiletries/amenities, make you feel you are getting some of what you pay for.

Needs refurb to keep the magic/reputation of the first 7star hotel of the world!","5","2018-04"
"A star service  ","Visited the Skyview Bar for high tea. The staff service at the bar is good. 

However the service staff at Burj Al Arab entrance were not attentive as they were just standing at the entrance chit chatting and no greeting from them either. ","5","2018-04"
"Hi tea at burj al Arab sahn Eddar","Booked a hi tea at Sahn Eddar. A lil bit of formal wear and you are ready. Going there with two checkpost asking for reservations and on entering you feel gold and rich color combination enhancing the royal experience. 
The staff was very polite and guiding you about the place. 
Only issue i had was to visit the upper deck. 
I would have booked at sky bar upper deck but due to a child i didnt so asked if i can go and just to experience the place but the staff said only having reservation to sky bar you can go. 
So enjoyed my 3 course hi tea at lounge with live music. Food had a rich taste and flavours. 
Staff at lounge was very active though if reordered any specific item they take so much time that you just want to leave it. 
I recommend this place but i would recommend booking afternoon tea at sky bar as you ll get a view of outside while having delicious food.","4","2018-04"
"Great place to be","Great place for sunset. Shisha Ahmed is great and manager Nalaka is very helpful. This is not my regular place and I will be regular. I am a gold Sirius member and I am happy to be a member in Burj al Arab. Service is one of the best I received Abin my sever he knows what he is doing. I use to stay time to time in Al Qasr,Zabeel Sara(Mr.Omar👍),Al Naseem
(GM Mr.Azar❤️)Dar al Masayaf,and city hotels Jumeirah Creek but this is the best I must say.","5","2018-05"
"Surperb tea","On an excursion from a cruise we went for high tea on the 27th floor of the hotel. The hotel is fabulous and we were treated royaly for tea. The items served were delicious. The view was great and the service excellent. This is truly a grand hotel.","5","2018-05"
"Best Valentines Ever!!!","We stayed for 2days in Burj Al Arab during Valentines and the experience was mind blowing! Awesome Suite, fabolous interior, great food, amazing staff! Loved all of it. Tire's nothing to compare and every moment of our stay was magical.

Incomparable luxury of Burj is Highly recommended!!

"Pure indulgence!","The rooms are divine suites, all amenities are luxurious, and the spa & indoor pool are blissful. 

Would highly recommend to all considering the cost of the luxurious hotel. 

Even if you only do it once, you just do it! We will hopefully return one day :) ","5","2018-04"
"Exquisite Property & Service","Our experience at the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah was just as we wanted it to be - private, quiet, and romantic. The property lives up to its reputation, and is quite stunning. ID and reservations are required to pass through strict security. Every possible detail is anticipated and the entire building is immaculate. If you have an opportunity to stay or visit the Burj - it's a must. Whether you are an eco-traveler or a Michelin maven, your sense of style and standards will be elevated.","5","2018-01"
"World famous burj ","It’s a beautiful landmark hotel the service we received was fantastic very high quality food and drinks. This is my favourite place in Dubai it’s a experience to go in burj al Arab. We really enjoyed definitely going back again and again. ","5","2018-05"
"High tea was epic! ","As a birthday treat my friend and I decided to book on to the high tea in the afternoon at the Burj Al Arab. This turned out to be an incredible 7 course high tea!! We had the most stunning view as we had a table by the window (highly recommend).

We were first offered dates and drinks (alcohol available if desired), then went on to a prawn cocktail, a different array of sandwiches, lemon sorbet to cleanse the palette, beautiful scones with clotted cream and jams and a variety of other desserts! As many hot or soft drinks as you want throughout. They take every care to cater to your needs if you have any allergies. 

The service from the staff was second to none. They were gracious, kind, friendly, attentive, non- fussy and informative!

Upon finding out it was both our birthdays they were so incredibly kind and brought us both a slice of cake and a fresh red rose out each! Our waiter even sang us happy birthday! 

If you’re looking to be pampered and literally waited on hand and foot, as well as being stuffed to the core then this is an experience you must not miss! ","5","2018-04"
"Talise Spa @ Burj Al Arab - mindblowing . . .","What a wonderful spa!  Incredible views over Dubai from the heated quartz bed and incredible treatments.  From the welcome on arrival to the afternoon tea served by the pool (on the 27th floor!) it was magical.  Special thanks to Neil Hewerdine for the personal care he gave to our appointment from my initial query to the welcome and farewell.  I will be back.","5","2018-04"
"Unexpected surprise ","Anyone dreaming of dining at the magnificent Burj al Arab must take advantage of the ‘jumeriah restaurant week’ offer. Applicable 29 April til 5 May, it s available al fresco dining in their ‘Scape’ restaurant and it s a 3 course mouthwatering delight. An excellent choice of set menu and the staff are all amazing. We were excellently looked after by the lovely Nilah who made us feel very relaxed and comfortable throughout the evening. Her knowledge of the food and hotel other restaurants was superb. You must pre pay upon reservation but at aed250 per person it s an unforgettable experience.","5","2018-05"
"View around the Burj is more exotic than on the Burj :-))","WoW......Plan your day & especially during the evenings, since food on cruise is quite tempting & spread amazing....a subtle signal that you may miss your next day morning travails :-))

Try the Indian guide services (Mamoothy) is really amazing .....you would be lucky to get him although....","5","2018-04"
"Save your money and stay at Jumeirah Al Naseem instead","Second time of staying in the Burj Al Arab and felt compelled to write a review as it was once again a disappointment.

The first time we stayed our check in process was ridiculous, nobody seemed to know what they were doing, we had to wait about 30-40 minutes before we were shown up to our room and when we were then shown into the room they gave us the paperwork for another guest (who had the same first name as my husband). We were told it was due to it being a Chinese public holiday so the hotel was much busier than normal as a vast majority of it's guests are Chinese

We took them at their word and booked again, assuming that when the hotel was quieter the check in process and general service would be much better - not so.

- Tried to check in at 12.30 pm, room not ready which is OK as they don't guarantee check in until 3.00 pm (although it's never fully occupied so I don't see why they can't have a room ready for you). Were told that they would call my mobile phone when the room was ready, by 3.30 pm we had still not received a call so had to go back to reception where they apologised and said we hadn't been called because our room was only just ready. So a 7 star hotel thinks it's OK for your room to be ready 30 minutes late and not call you to explain and apologise...
- When we got to the room I asked for our bags to brought up, they then brought us another guests bags... it took them more than 30 minutes to locate our bags and bring them to us, it also shows that they are not at all careful with guest luggage which is a worry.
- When our bags were collected upon check out the butler informed the member of staff collecting them that our car was already downstairs, so we expected the bags to be put straight into the car, when we got downstairs (about 15 minutes after the bags had been taken) our bags were not there and nobody knew where they were. Then they found them on a trolley (with three bags there were not ours) and proceeded to load the wrong bags into our car (as not all bags had been labelled when they were collected). Thankfully I checked otherwise we would have arrived at the airport with someone else's bags.

In short...

Cons - check in/check out process, no adults only pool, hotel full of visiting day trippers (they are everywhere!)

Pro's - high quality and large suites with good views, great butler staff and unique pool setting

I'd recommend booking a stay in a suite at any of the other Jumeirah Madinat hotels, particularly Al Naseem. You'll get a far better service for half the money.","3","2018-04"
"One of the heaven ever seen","Best atmosphere,  the last word for luxury ,  excellent  customer  service. Best service  provided.  Best hotel ever seen. Icon of dubai
Friendly  staffs.  For the price  its worth. I didn't  stay  but i visited with  my friend.","5","2017-06"
"Sophie","Amazing hotel, amazing staff so happy to help and always make you feel important. Really would recommend to anyone. Anything you need the hotel has got it nothing is to much for them. Was an absolute pleasure will be back soon

"Very special visit","I visited the Burj al Arab for afternoon tea with a close colleague who together with, we were celebrating our 10 year work  anniversary. It was well and truly a special occasion and we couldn’t have chosen a more special venue. Fantastic service and great venue!","5","2017-11"
"Fabulous stay","Check in speed is a little slow, and the reception should show sincerely, though they keep smiling. The lobby is a little messy at noon, a lot of tourists visiting and taking photos. There are many facilities, have not enough time to taste all.","5","2018-04"
"BETT Trip. ","After attending a conference in Abu Dhabi it was wonderful to end up at the Burj Al Arab for 3 days of R&R.   Service was outstanding.  Mea and Meg the suite Butlers we always gracious and helpful.  Further more a young man In The lobby by the Name of Sriram helped me several times with directions and so I would seek him if I had a question.   What he didn’t know he figured out quickly and it was clearly not his job. His above and beyond approach is much a lost art in today’s world.   He was a day saver and game changer for this short trip 

The spa was very nice and food was great at every restaurant. 

Lastly. While pricey the helicopter tour off the roof landing pad was great.  With long time pilot Andrew was very skilled and polite as well.  Andrew is said to hold the record for the most landings a top the Burj.  

It was a once in a lifetime trip. 

God Bless. ","5","2018-04"
"Stunning architecture, luxurious, wild colours, tacky and vulgar","Magnificent setting and dramatic architecture. Atrium is remarkably coloured, cascading waters, escalators, dripping plants and crazy colours. But over all it's vulgar - the designers have thrown every colour, fabric, natural and fake material at it meaning there's no real 'style' to speak of. Highly expensive to sleep here, eat here, stand here or breathe. Leave it to the peacocks and those who 'need to be seen'.","3","2017-11"
"The perfect special treat","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab on our Sirius points to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday..  We just stayed for one night but for the most part, it is amazing.   First we attended the Brunch at Al Muntaha.  The service, food and wine were amazing as before.  The room was very special and was larger than some of the places we have lived in.  We had upgraded to a corner room and it was worth it.  The view was awesome.  We spent some time at the pool and then went to Gold on 24 and had a great table where we could watch the lovely view and have great cocktails.  The next day was spent at the pool with a cabana.  At all time the service was great and we got to eat to breakfast at our favourite place,  Junsui.  My only complaint, as I am childless, is that there was no place for adults to escape from the children (there were children playing in the hot tubs and also in the indoor pool).  That was disappointing.  Overall, if you have a special occasion, this is the place to be.","4","2017-12"
"just amazing....","this is our second visit to this hotel from india, this time we went for breakfast at lobby level and just amazing experince. my parents 50 th anniversary was there so they gave a surprise with flowers, rose petals n cake. food was good however, we feel that the menu items should be more in this price.","5","2018-04"
"Had much higher expectations.","We revisited burj al Arab around 10 times, and that is purely for a personal reason , however, every time we expected their service to improve and it didn’t . Their staff rotation is so fast , that no one is trained properly. Over 1 year ago they literally had a kids size pool , at those prices you would expect at least a decent size. Beside the morning views , and the new pools which are decent , is nothing there to impress . Was in all restaurants , burned food at the top ( the staff didnt apologize or offered a replacement ) , horrible smells in the Asian ( where the food is good but you need to jump in shower strainght after cause you all smell worst than a cantine ) , breakfast is mediocre, they can’t do anything right, the aquarium restaurant downstairs treated us horrible , have no clue of an international dress code asked my husband who was wearing a collar shirt to wear a blazer , and left some weird guest in sweat black pants and sneakers! Prices are to high for what it is. TVs in the bedrooms are on a wrong angle , and they had technical issues every time we stayed there , so I had to interrupt my stay every time and wait for a technician to fix it. The staff is constantly bothering you with phone calls. The clientele is not well behaved , the entrance is literally a bus station since there are buses with tourists stoping every 30 min. Is crowded , you can’t get in your elevator , is a lot of events which brings so many weird people in. They don’t even serve freshly squeezed juices at the pool , they expect at 2000$ a night people to drink canned beverages. In the spa , you literally have a pool and few beds , can’t enjoy any unique experience there . Massages was horrible I left all bruised after a romantic private evening at the spa with a cost of extra 2000$. 
The worst experience there: 
Once we went to the pool at 11 am and was told we can’t enter the pool since they found some guest excrements in the pool and is due to desinfection ?!!!! I mean come on ! The decor is not that great either , is quite scary in 2 br suit at night. The management doesn’t follow up with your complaints, neither does anything to improve!  Not a single signature dish in the hotel , even the jacuzzi water in the pool is to hot , like 100 degrees outside are not enough.","1","2018-01"
"50th birthday","Amazing 50th birthday experience at the Burj Al Arab. A unforgettable treat.  Thankyou to everyone that made this possible . A experience we will treasure forever . See you again very soon InshaAllah x","5","2018-04"
"Great place for that special occasion","Its an outstanding hotel, you fee special from the moment you enter. Here all the rooms are great and the dining is amazing. You also have a number of different restaurants to chose from if you wish. If your not staying at the hotel try as a special treat afternoon tea.
The best is the English afternoon tea, recent addition is the Arabian tea. You can just relax and soak up the relaxing atmosphere. Its a pity there is not a dress code during my visit there seemed to be a number of people having afternoon tea wearing cargo pants and carrying rucksacks.","5","2018-04"
"One of the finest hotels in the world!","Shaped like a giant sail, this is one of Dubai’s landmarks .  Service is immaculate, impressive, and personal, with every wish handled immediately.

"50th Birthday Trip","The Burj Al Arab claims to be the most luxurious hotel in the world and it totally delivered for us. 

I booked the hotel for my wife’s 50th Birthday and asked them what they could do to make her feel special. They told me they are well versed in making people feel extra special on special occasions and left it at that. 

They absolutely knocked it out of the park. From the flowers in the car for our airport transfer, the meet and greet with Ingrid on arrival, the upgraded suite, more flowers, complimentary wine,  chocolates, strawberries and birthday cake accompanied by a Happy Birthday song and card by the guest services team everything was done with grace and a sincere smile. 

The terrace experience was the most peaceful and relaxing way to spend the afternoon with drinks at the Skyview Bar to follow in the evening. The cocktails were amazing with some of them either making your eyes roll into the back of your head or giving you a crick in the neck, if you know what I mean.

Dinner at the Al Iwan Arabic restaurant topped off the night, not that we needed it as we had eaten our body weight in olives at the Skyview Bar thanks to Kumar who was a great host. After a sumptuous buffet dinner we were ambushed with more birthday cake and more singing. So very grateful to the Al Iwan waiters, we are just sorry that we couldn’t do the cake justice as we had eaten so much already. 

Special mentions to Shubum and Vivek, our floor butlers who could not do enough for us, and another mention for Ingrid who made a point of seeing us off in the lobby and using her contacts at our next hotel to make sure that we were warmly welcomed there. ","5","2018-04"
"Luxury in dubai","Burj Al Arab spectacular, stunning,from arriving to vibrant colored  sail and being personally greeted and introduced to the hotel amenities, escorted to our butler and then to a luxurious 2 story suite we were blown away by the service and class. The suite is amazing with a butler on call 24 hour service and nothing is too much.. I think above everything it's the service I will praise the highest.","5","2018-04"
"Good quality fine dining","We had to visit here on our honeymoon, as we'd heard good things from family.
We booked through our hotel for lunch & was told to dress smart.
wow!! hotel is indulgence personified, from entering to the water feature to getting in the lift to the restaurant. stunning!!
Once sat in the restaurant, what a view, right across the palm stunning.
We didn't go too mad & went for the main course & desert meal.
We both went for the steak mains, which was cooked to perfection, followed by a desert of Choux pastry, which was very nice as well.
Anyone coming to Dubai, has got to visit here & try, the views are stunning, the food is very good.
Be prepared to take a financial kick in the pocket, as its pricey, but, Dubai is pricey.

"Holiday of a Lifetime","Stayed at the Burj. Hotel second to none. Fabulous hotel with great staff and wonderful restaurants. Hard to choose which restaurant was our favourite.

"Another fantastic stay","We returned to this hotel for Easter and again having stayed last year it just surpasses our expectations every time. Staff brilliant and service faultless as always. The best service we have experienced and we have stayed at quite a few hotels in Dubai. The food is great although having a three year old with us you are restricted with several of the other places like Nathan Outlaw restaurants don't accept children, we tried some of the other places in the madinat hotel close by which are ok.","5","2018-04"
"Perfect evening","We had dinner in the JUNSUI restaurant as part of our honeymoon. The food was amazing and there was so much choice, the whole dinning experience was great, and I cannot thank Joyce, a fun and helpful employee, enough for her help, assistance and advice on what to try. She put petals on the table, gave my wife chocolates and a rose and then the kind restaurant manager gave us a tour of the hotel grounds.  Brilliant evening, thank you very much.","5","2018-04"
"Opulent, luxurious and wonderful.","Afternoon tea at the Al Arab  was a wonderful experience and a perfect end to our trip to Dubai.
 It was expensive (£130 per person) but -for a one-off, holiday experienc e - it was well worth every penny.
The setting is beautiful; the building stunning. All staff are helpful, welcoming and knowledgeable with nothing being too much trouble. 
We half expected the food to be nice but not really worth the cost - assuming we were paying for the experience and the views. We were wrong. go
The initial courses were small - a stuffed date, a salad and a quiche but each was beautifully presented and so tasty. There was a good range of interesting sandwiches and a sharp sorbet before the final much-anticipated scones and cakes. The cakes were pretty, scrumptious and surprisingly large. When one of the waiters spotted us halving each (as we all wanted to try everyone) he dashed over to tell us we didn't need to share as 'the chef has made plenty'. Unfortunately we were too full to take them up on this!
A glass of champagne, unlimited fruit juices, soft drinks and iced coffees plus a wide range of traditional teas and coffees are also included in the price.
People watching was also fun with an interesting mix of the seriously wealthy and the treating-themselves-tourists.also
Would definitely recommend this as a must-do (even if you have to stay in a cheaper hotel to afford it 😊)","5","2018-04"
"Absolutely wonderful!","The views from this place and of this place are incredible!! The hotel is definitely a 7 star Hotel because it’s so beautiful and the staff is awesome! The entire building is so wonderful and the restaurants and simply fantastic!","5","2018-04"
"AN EXPERIENCE WITH A 'WOW' FACTORY","Overall I think the hotel is excellent, as soon as you arrive you are totally looked after. The butler service was second to non.  The bars and restaurants in the evening were fantastic.  The pool facilities were also excellent. ","5","2018-04"
"Overrated touristic place","Overrated place. Nothing special. Average service. 

To visit the place you have to pay 100 AED/person, which you can spent at the bar. 

To go to the higher floor you have to reserve the restaurant and spent at least 350 AED. 

Inside the hotel we expected more. However it wasn’t WOW. 

My wife and I paid 200 AED and seat at the bar outside. For 7 star hotel I expected some excellent service. But unfortunately, nothing special. It is became a touristic place. People come and go. No any personal attachment to service. 

Worth it to go? Just to know that it is nothing special about the place. ","3","2018-04"
"Drinks and views ","Nice atmospheric lounge on the 27th floor (Gold on 27). Cocktails and bar food are very nice. Staff are very friendly. We’ve been here for the first time and we will come back. The views are great and the cars outside also... ","5","2018-04"

"Simply the best!","This hotel lives up to its reputation. What an awesome experience. We booked the Terrace Experiece which includes breakfast, airport transfers and daily use of an air conditioned private cabana. Access to Wild Wadi Park and the beach are complimentary. We went to the Jumeriah customer service area after clearing customs. They had a sign with our name. The staff welcomed us to Dubai and offered refreshments. She took us to the car. The well dressed driver loaded our luggages. My wife was given a box of red roses before getting in the car. We were offered our choice of music for this half hour ride to the hotel. Upon reaching the hotel, we were greeted as soon as we got out of the car by staff who accompanied us to our suite. The hotel lobby is huge. Ceiling extended all the way up the height of the building. There were fountains in the center and a wall aquarium alongside the escalator. This hotel is richly decorated. Our suite is 2 stories. Bedroom, bath and dressing room are upstairs. The wall to ceiling windows provide sweeping views of the gulf and the city. The staff explained the services, offered to make dining reservations and completed our check in. She answered all our questions. Soon after she left, the butler ( available 24 hours) came in with welcome drinks and gave us a briefing about the suite- lights, shower, tv, etc. There is a consierge desk on every floor located by the elevators.

"LOVE THIS HOTEL ","Being an emirati i always visit Burj Al Arab and most of my friends and family too,in Concierge Oscar always go above and beyond to look after us,helipad and restaurant experience is phenomenal,love the view from my suit ","5","2017-12"
"Scape liunge","Visited the scape lounge. What a fantastic hotel. Has to be seen to be believed. 
Definitely worth a visit if in Dubai. You need to make a booking though, otherwise you cannot access the hotel. Enjoy!!","5","2018-04"
"Wonderful skylview bar for cocktails and bar food","Had a wonderful evening with great service , fascinating cocktails and some good bar food . Fantastic view of Dubai at night....we booked for 7pm and got up at 7pm when bar opened and got seats in front of window for the views. Staff were very good at letting people move to window seats as they became free. Hotel staff were also very friendly and helpful.","5","2018-03"
"Amazing hotel!!","I was visiting this hotel in March and I found it as luxurious as they say it is. However I found Gold on 27 bar bit disappointing, I mean it had no wow factor as you would expect to see when in such bar. Parking space also seems to be very crowded so when coming again won't use my own car. Planning to visit this hotel again in the future.","5","2018-03"
"Best hotel in the World","Burj Al-Arab is amazing hotel! I didn’t sleep there but I visited there in Sahn-Eddar Lounge. Hotel is full of gold and luxurious things. Sahn-Eddar lounge is perfect place to take your afternoon coffee or anything. In future I hope that I can home back and maybe... sleep there 😁👍. THANK YOU!","5","2018-03"
"In the middle of 4/5 stars.","I would like to firstly point out that this hotel is amazing however there is a few points that NEED to be addressed. We arrived at the airport and we opted for the Rolls Royce to take us to the Burj when we got to the car we was greeted by our chauffeur who presented me with roses very professional service and definitely recommended. When we arrived at the hotel they greeted us with our names from where they had been radioing through which I thought was a lovely touch and with this being our second stay welcoming us back, they take you straight up to your suite to check you in, the room is very dated and smells very muggy even though it’s spotless, the rooms have great amenities & toiletries are incredible. After being asked if we wanted help with unpacking and sorting ourself out we went down to the pool, the new pool area is brilliant it has a infinity pool and soon as you sit down they bring water and facial mist over we also had lunch here which was really nice. After this we decided to pop over to wild Wadi, a free buggy took us over there and you get free entry and towels. After this we came back to the  hotel and you get welcomed back each time. When coming downstairs to go for dinner the lobby area was so busy full of tourists taking pictures and even people lying on the floor not what you expect to see, when walking out of the hotel we was told ‘thanks for visiting come again soon’ which implied they thought we wasn’t staying there, The valet park area of an evening it’s ABSOUTLE CAYOS!! nobody knows what’s going on there’s people arriving people going I’m not being funny but if your paying how much you are I expect to walk out and not have to battle in front of 50 other people who have popped over to get a photo or have a dinner reservation this massively contributed to my 4 stars and not 5! Breakfast is incredible there is anything you could possibly imagine. Overall hotel is amazing and would return but I think the rooms need updating and they need a better system in place so they know who is a staying guest and who isn’t just so you aren’t asked for your room number everywhere you go, this may be due to the fact we are young in our low 20’s but still don’t feel this should make a difference.","4","2018-03"
"impressive in many ways","Dubai without a visit to Burj Al Arab is not sufficient. Architecture impressive from the outside and the inside - especially loved the aquarium which you see already as you enter, a windy red leather couch and a gigantic lobby going up behind it - hard to put into words, have to see it yourselves. upstairs is a sky lounge (one quiet one and one more noisy one) with amazing views over the city! cocktails there are excellent and the views breathtaking - the interior design up there dates back in time of course and the as one can expect surely prices are very high...","4","2018-03"
"Excellent High Tea","Wonderful service from the moment we arrived. So worth getting dressed up to enjoy first class service and food.

Some tips. The waiters do bring around seconds of the savouries, which were my favourite. More than enough food. Recommend the second seating as there is no rush to leave and you can enjoy the sunset. You will get a window view after most guests have left. Given the often poor visibility in Dubai due sand and dust, I do not feel the additional cost for a window seat is worth it. All seats enjoy a view. Overall a great experience and worth the expense. Had no problem getting a normal taxi back to my hotel. ","5","2018-03"
"A wonderful experience ","Our friends had organised for us our stay in this hotel, it was beyond our expectations.

Although the decor; I wouldn't classify it to my particular taste, on the contrary the whole theme suited so well. Various colours with contrast, Daily fruits replenished, evening canapés delivered to us on the daily, a kiddies trolley comes around every evening to provide my children will a selection of snacks(which they will forever be grateful for) Hermes toiletries, the amazing dates and baklava gifted to us, many other minor additions that make this place very memorable in the most wonderful way. 

The buffet breakfast is amazing, they remembered my coffee order for the duration of my stay. My family and I miss this place and highly recommend it! ","5","2018-02"
"Happy ","This is a great Hotel, you have your own Butler, the service is excellent, the food is superior, the Restaurant inside the Aquarium is amazing, Breakfast outside overlooking the Sea, the price for all this luxury is high ","5","2018-02"
"Great place to relax ","Everything is good and perfect 
Price justify the service 
Pool side facilities need to be reviewed 
Food and beverage Manger at pool side  needed to be on communication skill
Butlers are very helpful 24/7 
Mohan & Ayub  brilliant guys . 

","5","2018-03"
"Incredible place!","From the moment you see the hotel on the skyline, the wow factor begins. Scented fresh flowers in the entrance, three water features and two large fish tanks before you get to the gold plated lifts. The rooms are bigger than the average detached house and high end furnished. Everything is gold plated and immaculately clean. A huge jacuzzi, shower, his and hers sinks, soft fluffy towels and Hermes toiletries make the bathroom delightful. The breakfast is superb with everything anyone could want and overlooking the Sea.
Outside is something else. A huge heated infinity pool, another huge heated pool and a smaller heated pool all with lots of padded sun loungers, fluffy towels and iced water, plus numerous lifeguards.
Chauffeur driven golf buggies are there to take you to the private beach and old Shopping area opposite. 3 days are the minimum required to appreciate everything this icon hotel has to offer.
My only niggle was the high price of the evening meals but we ate out at the Madinat opposite. 
The staff are really polite, helpful and cheerful - always smiling.
Have stayed here before and will definately be staying here again.","5","2018-03"
"Good, But...","If you’re going to visit Dubai, I would recommend staying at the Burj Al Arab and chalking it up to a “bucket list” splurge.

And if you can swing the addition splurge, I’d take the 45 minute helicopter tour off the hotel’s roof helipad (hey, you only live once).

We stayed in a Panoramic Suite, which was a loft room that had floor-to-ceiling windows on 2 sides.  Dawn and evening views of the city and Burj Khalifa were great.

The Burj Al Arab staff were a bit of a downer.  We didn’t feel that welcomed by the staff.  On the contrary, we got the sense the staff considered guests with average financial means to be a necessary evil.","4","2018-03"
"Beautiful Luxious hotel but...","Such a beautiful hotel, the design, layout and room arrangement are fantastic.  Even though most of the staff are nice but they're not as friendly as expected as this scale of hotel which was a little bit disappointed.   I'll reserve the willingness for re-visit.","3","2018-03"
"Excellent Lunch 7stars","It was simply Perfect. The Luxury that doesn't need any further comments. Location is 
incomparable, staff was very kind an professional. The panoramic view from the top of the hotel is breathless. Lunch was superb. The perfection.","5","2018-02"
"Too much ","I actually have nothing for which to fault the hotel. It’s as advertised , and more. Luxury that gets into lascivious territory. Everything is an exaggeration of gilded glamour and royal blue splendour . Staff caters to your every whim.
It just made me.. uncomfortable. I just couldn’t enjoy it.
But if you want to feel like royalty, there is nothing better. I guess I’m just a simple man in whom so much glorious pomp is a little bit wasted.

","3","2018-03"
"Outstanding","Glacie and Ahmed and Jeremy were absolutely wonderful hosts. Truly a one of a kind seven star hotel experience. Customer service is second to none, would highly recommend anyone visiting dubai to visit the burj al arab","5","2018-03"
"Excellent Experience","Really nice place and service in this lovely restaurant, have memorial time here
Because this trip hope to get visit everywhere, some friends recommend me this one
The food is ok , also nice waiter and manager make everyone feel comfort","5","2018-03"
"Excellent atmosphere ","I love to go burj al Arab everyday whenever I’m in Dubai the food is excellent the atmosphere the behavior of staff I love to go to escape lounge the sheesha makers are perfect they will make the best sheesha no doubt it’s a 7 star property keep it up ","5","2018-03"
"Nice view and service","Good meal and service. Enjoyed the meal with friends very much. There is a lot of different kinds of Arbaic desserts and dates. The staff are very nice and helpful. My friends left her bags in the restaurant, the staff ran to give it back to us.","5","2018-03"
"Luxurious","My boyfriend and I booked to visit the building. 
The cost is very high but if you have time you have to visit it, I recommend you go during the day and if you want to have lunch or dinner you can choose the menu from 3 course meal, are sufficient (drinks are not included). ","4","2018-03"
"Afternoon Tea","Spend a very pleasant afternoon in this impressive hotel. Afternoon tea was a delight & enjoyable. The highlight was Jeremy giving us all a lesson in tea, where it comes from,  types of tea & about the taste. I enjoyed myself and would visit again ","5","2018-03"
"No experience like it","Fortunate to make his a 3rd visit in 10 years this hotel is like no other. The service, rooms and all round experience is something you're unlikely to get in any other hotel in the world. The changes to the hotel facilities are also excellent taking the pool out into the sea and adding bigger lounge areas.

The only negative is the volume of tourists in the lobby but has to be expected given it is an iconic building.","5","2018-02"
"What a wonderful evening. Thanks to everyone involved","We were spending three days in Dubai to celebrate meeting whilst working there in March 1988 and booked the cocktail package at the Skyview Bar on the 27th floor. We left in 1989 but have returned a few times over the years and in the late 1990’s watched the Burj Al Arab rising majestically from the sea.

We booked directly with the Burj Al Arab (BAA) and every detail was handled in a very friendly and efficient manner. We mentioned that this was part of our celebrations and the evening could not have been better. We knew that there was a Minimum spend of AED 370 per person; not too hard to achieve 😊 and you have a certain time to be there, ours starting at 7:30pm.

We felt so looked after from the minute we walked into the lift and then being taken to our seats, albeit a little away from the windows but we could still enjoy the view. We ordered a bottle of champagne and this arrived accompanied by a three-layer tower of roasted nuts; loved the smoked almonds the most! We had only just started our first glass when we were asked to move to another table – right by the window looking down the coast. Fabulous!!

We ordered four dishes, served on a tower, of smoked salmon, hommus, tuna tartare and a beef slider. All were so tasty and satisfying. There was no haste or hassle, just time to sit back and take in The View!! After the dishes were taken away, we were presented with a very tasty chocolate cake and a rose. What a perfect ending to a perfect evening.

Thank you so much to all the staff who looked after us that evening and made it so special.","5","2018-03"
"Better places for afternoon tea for a lot less money ","We were really keen to visit the Burj, it's such an iconic building and we wondered how they'd better other places for afternoon tea.  We enjoyed the visit to the Sky-view bar but in reality felt a little cheated by the hype, the food is good but not worth £120 per head.  The view of the gulf isn't that great, it just doesn't compare for example with the Burj Khalifa where the views are stunning and memorable for a lot less money.  In terms of quality, yes it's good but no better than other places and not a patch on the Ritz in London.t

It's great to get a chance to walk around such an exclusive hotel, I did feel a little out of place though and the staff in reception tended to look down their nose at you as a visitor rather than a guest.  

If you are keen to explore the Burj al Arab the only way to to this is book into one of their restaurants and bar.  Rather than splash out once Sky-view bar I'd recommend the Scape bar at the rear of the hotel which is a lot cheaper and gives you a chance not only to wander around the impressive lobby area but the rear of the hotel outside.","3","2018-03"
"Tourist attraction rather than a quiet hotel","This hotel is ageing and has turned into a tourist attraction (even in the pool area) rather than a quiet and luxurious hotel. Service was excellent, pool area outstanding, but rooms are ageing (e.g. TVs and Jacuzzi not working, white marble floor getting colored) while restaurant quality (Marhaba) only mediocre.","2","2018-03"
"THE BURJ","Exceeded our expectations in terms of ambience, service, quality of food. the property made us feel quite pampered. The architecture  is fantastic and the staff are quite professional in their duties in all departments.","5","2018-03"
"my best destination ever","really what i can say after what i have see i wish my eyes could talk or record all my visits to burj more than that before i ll start talking about the property itself i need to thank some special people that make always my visits Woow starting by the first person make me feel excited to come Channel from the call centre i never made my booking by fone and not finishing by smiling then coming to the entrance i really like the welcoming from those fantastic people valet bell boys door mans they are really lovely even i made them take with me picture i cant go to any of the outlets without passing by Sahn Al Dar to say nihao to that beautiful hostess from china and get a warm welcoming from Belinida Goisha and Berma to make my afternoon feel like am on my right destination really i feel home following it by nice dinner experience in Bab al yam really thank you chef for the special food every time especially the wagu without forgetting Asel and the other c hannel finishing the experience with one of the best lounges at the World The Scape with Mr Marwan dabbech

so i really recommend you guys to do same like me then share your experience","5","2018-03"
"Overwhelming experience","Our son booked a meal for us in this hotel in Arabian Buffet restaurant whilst on holiday in Dubai. The hotel is out of this world and the service from the moment you enter is an experience . Food in the restaurant was superb and the whole experience was overwhelming","5","2018-03"
"The ultimate luxury for a 1001 nights fantasy!","A fantastic hotel/resort... Exclusive, there are basically no rooms... the smallest in which we stayed at was an approximately 170 square meters, two floors apartment with an office, bathrooms on each floor, showers, jacuzzi, golden polished handles, floor to ceiling windows with astonishing views, an office with everything you could think of, printer, apple computer, telephone, a huge living room with surround system for a cinema like feeling, your own personal butler. It is just a unique experience to be in this world landmark.
I think it embodies everything that Dubai stands for! A young society but an old culture, ambition, vision, opulence, a fresh start, hope for even a better tomorrow.
The swimming pools are amazing, but i prefer the beach. You get a buggy to drive you on shore, where there is another 5 star resort by the same owner with a wonderful beach club that caters to your every need, and has an immaculate white sand.
The asian breakfast restaurant is absolutely terrific... A wide variety of dishes ranging from Korean to Chinese and Japanese, as well as Indian influences.
One downside (pretty much the only one) is that the European breakfast restaurant, to my taste lacks the variety it should bolster.","5","2017-07"
"Amazing experience!","Booked afternoon tea for my sisters 40th at the Skyview Bar which is 200m above sea level. 
Asked for a window view which they accommodated. 
The food, service and overall experience was amazing, we didn’t want to leave.","5","2018-02"
"Special breakfast","We booked breakfast in order to visit this luxurious hotel. It was great experience. Meal was plentiful and delicious. Staff was superb. They asked that do have some anniversary and I gave a hint that Im going to propose. They arranged a special ""will you marry me"" cake and beatiful rose to our table so surprise to my gírlfriend worked very well. Perfect overall! Thank you!","5","2018-03"
"Hands down the best hotel to visit.","We came here for afternoon tea and had a tour of the hotel. Honestly this was the best hotel ever, from the minute we entered the staff were so welcoming. The fountains are really cool and the water sort of do a dance. The view from the highest level was amazing after our afternoon tea, and we had some drinks whilst we were enjoying the beautiful view of Dubai. The service is absolutely amazing. The staff are so pleasant. And the drinks are so good and different to the norm.","5","2018-02"
"Exquisite!","This hotel is fabulous. There is definitely nothing like it. The service the second you walk in the door is amazing. It was definitely a steep price to pay, but worth it to try the experience for a night. We had the panoramic view, it was incredible. We wouldn't stay here again, but would recommend.","5","2017-04"
"Amazing","We visited the Scape Restaurant and had a delicios meal. The staff were all helpful and attentive. We had a 3 course meal and each course was original and well presented. We would recommend this restaurant and the Burj al Arab is amazong.","5","2018-03"
"Afternoon tea","Went for afternoon tea. By far the best afternoon tea experience!! Staff are amazing every single item was so good!!! The lobby is so nice with amazing decor the date juice was so yummy. Overall a really really good experience. ","5","2017-04"
"A luxury trip","If you can afford this, do it. Extravagant yes, a special event , do it. Burj al Arab hotel is amazing, no expense spared. Service over your 2 hours is splendid, slow the staff down, enjoy a afternoon tea to remember. If you don't finish it,ask for a box. ","4","2018-03"

"Amazing hotel","My husband and I stayed in the panoramic one - bedroom suite. The room was huge with an amazing view the only thing I did not like about it was the interior I thought it was a bit old.
although the curtains were electronic but it took a long time for them to lift its self up.
Service was more than excellent!!
Breakfast was very limited.","4","2018-02"
"Perfect place for parties","We came here to attend a friends engagement party and it was super fancy everything from the arrangement to the service and food was phenomenal and elegant

"The very best afternoon tea","Everything you would expect from a 7 star hotel for afternoon tea.
Nothing but the best & warm friendly genuine welcome from arrival to service from Tajax & the team.

As my husband isn't a seafood fan his sandwich section reflected this. 
7 generous fabulous courses consisting of: Bubbles, dates, prawn cocktail, quiche, sandwich selection, sorbet, scones & pastries. 

A fantastic harp player serenaded us with modern tunes with what has to be my favouite view on Dubai.
This afternoon tea is worth every cent, with 7 courses, bubbles, as a tea lover a choice of over 50 teas/coffees was welcomed, along with juices, softdrinks the list was endless.
I enjoyed the peppermint, elderflower & lemon as my favourites while my husband didnt venture from the english breakfast!

Nothing was too much trouble for Tajax, did we want more of anything! If only we had room....

The 16:15 last afternoon sitting is ideal as we then enjoyed a drink while watching the sunset over the palm before we left.

The best service, food, beverages, ambience & view Dubai has to offer...","5","2018-03"
"Superb Location ","It’s was our first time in this hotel and the place took our breath away .. room was huge with complimentary Hermès cosmetics and toiletries!!!! my son and daughter enjoyed the most .. 
Although the location and the exterior is in excellent condition, the room interior is showing some aging, needs refurbishment...
And surprisingly the breakfast buffet was very limited .. like in an avarage hotel !!!
But we were so taken by the pool and the location, it didn’t matter much at that time ..","4","2017-12"
"Luxury at its finest","We chose Burj Al Arab as its our Anniversary ritual stay, as well our babymoon getaway. Best hospitality i have ever experienced with the remarkable service of butlers you can imagine. Thank you Burj al Arab for the best memories.","5","2018-02"
"Fantastic from start to finish","My husband booked this hotel for a long weekend, we have stayed in Dubai and Abu Dhabi on numerous occasions, but this hotel is the icing on the cake.  We arrived and were greeted by name, our suite was already available (this was 9am) and we were checked into our suite by our butler.  It is these touches that make it such an amazing experience, a vase of roses in the room, a huge lounge with bar and fresh fruit, every evening the butler would come bringing drinks and snacks (generous  Gin & tonics I hasten to add!) The panoramic view was breathtaking, with the sun setting over The Atlantis.  Upstairs a huge bed and bathroom, the Hermes toiletries are legendary (was Googling them before we left!) we ate in both the rooftop French restaurant, the Nathan Outlaw seafood restaurant and the buffet.  All staff go above and beyond to help, a buggy took us to the beautiful sandy beach and you are greeted by name when you come back to the hotel.  My husband broke his glasses as we arrived, not a problem the butler got them repaired. Nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel like royalty. It is a hotel we would definitely go back to.  Thank you to all staff at Burj al Arab for making such memories for us and for such a beautiful hotel. ","5","2018-02"
"Amazing ","Had a panoramic suite and it was so spacious. The bed is a Dux brand and so comfortable. The bathroom is well-appointed, and the living area is provides expansive views. I enjoyed the Asian buffet for breakfast which includes many countries. The butlers on call see to it that every need you have is met. Color abounds throughout the interior and the service is second to none.","5","2018-02"
"Mr smith","Hello, I am writing this review prior to my stay at the Burj hotel. I have messaged you on messenger which states you get a reply typically within one day.... 7 days later down the line I still have not received a reply prior to stopping at your hotel for a night. I have also emailed the Jumeirah brand for the attention of yourselves. Now I know in the scheme of things one night is significant to yourselves but myself and my wife have saved a lot of money to stop at your hotel as well as other places for our honeymoon and also I am trying to sort out something for her birthday when we are due to stop at your hotel on the 10th March. For a 7 star hotel I would expect some sort of reply but to get nothing is ridiculous..... It is a nightmare trying to get in touch with yourselves and I will do another review after I have been, but if the service prior to attending is like this, I don’t hold up too much hope when we get there.","1","2018-03"
"Nice – But not Worth the Money!","Everybody has always mentioned how glamourous the Burj Al Arab is – it's a 7 star hotel right? However, when you discover how much you pay for a room – to what it looks like inside – I think you may feel a bit ripped off for your bucks! 

It's lovely – and in all honesty there's not much you can really fault about it – it's a beautiful hotel – I just don't think the price justifies what you get in return. 

The interior is very luxurious with gold plated everything and lots of nice restaurants, shops and pools however I just felt like there was something missing and it felt very ""touristy"" as opposed to luxurious.

"Good","Pretty good experience for my family. We enjoy every moment at the hotel, Their are so many pools, but one woman lifeguard wasn’t quiet nicely, she didn’t want to help us what we need and also your room door cannot lock the door to prevent someone comes in without permission","5","2018-02"
"Al Iwan Burj al Arab Restaurant","I celebrated my 30th birthday with my boyfriend at the Al Iwan Restaurant. 
It was an amazing experience!

We got a table next to the window with a wonderful view of the Dubai skyline. The meal was delicious, an Arabic buffet which leaves nothing to be desired (best hummus I ever ate).

We would like to give a special thank you to the crew for all the presents I got and especially for this pure and heartwarming service. I was extremely touched.

Book a table at the restaurant Al Iwan.

It is worth it!

Best regards

"Beautilful","Burj Al Arab is beautiful. 
We only saw it outside from the beach, and it looks amazing. It's worth it going there. You can take a taxi, buss or the turist-hop-on-of-buss. It's a must see. 7 star hotel.","5","2018-02"
"Indulge ","This is not your usual high end hotel! It’s an experience! 
✅ bucket list experience! 
From the moment you check in, they hand you a wet towel to cool off, some drink and dates. 
The place is absolutely amazing inside. The decor is grand and decadent.
You’re assigned a private butler who shows you to you duplex suite (there’s no rooms, just ‘suites’)
The whole experience from start to finish is just fantastic. 
The swimming pool on the top floor is must see, so is the pool side decking at the rear of the hotel. ","5","2017-03"
"Pre-Christmas holiday ","Stayed for 8 nights before Christmas. This was the third time we’ve stayed here. Positives-excellent service/staff, great new terrace outside, excellent facilities - spa/gym etc. Negatives which I have fed back to management:
- rooms need a refurb. Stayed in a panoramic room but they are dated now, no central control for lights/tv system is dated etc. Not what you expect for the price. 
- new beach terrace. Loads of children which is fine but a children’s section and adults only section would be better. 
- too many external visitors getting onto the terrace. It’s not as private as it was previously which was one of the nicest things about this place. 
- way too many tourists in the entrance. Come back in at 2am and the entrance is quiet. Perfect. Try and leave or come in outside of the middle of the night and it feels like you’re in a market. Really unpleasant. A hotel like this should be a sanctuary from the moment you walk in the door. I’m unsure why bus loads of tourists are allowed in at all. Make it private unless you have a restaurant reservation! 
- spa pool inside for men & women is small. That’s fine when adults are in there. However, two nights at 7pm loads of kids arrived with parents who couldn’t care less. They took over the small spa pool, splashing and jumping around. my partner and I had to leave as it wasn’t big enough for all us! It should def be for children over 16 only and you have so much space, build an indoor kids pool! 
There are a lot of very good hotel in Dubai now, unless the above are addressed We won’t stay again. It was a marked change from when we stayed in 2015. It’s supposed to be the best in the world so it really should feel like it! ","3","2017-12"
"7 star afternoon tea treat ","I had friends in town and we were all celebrating a very big milestone birthday for one of them, so booked afternoon tea in the Burj Al Arab. At around £120 each including a glass of champagne it isn’t cheap but what you get is 7 delicious courses of first class food served with 7 star service. You will never experience service like this anywhere else in the world. We jumped too early with the offer of some additional sandwiches and literally couldn’t move after course 5. By the 7th course we were fit to burst and have a nap! If you are going and getting dressed up, wear something nice and loose! Our birthday girl was given a beautiful cake and rose by the hotel and made for a truly memorable visit for all. Overall we thought it was very good value for the quality, quantity and service for the price. ","5","2018-02"
"unfriend butler","we stayed in this very expensive hotel for Chinese New Year, planned a particular family gatherinhg for 5 people. But the whole plan was ruined by this hostile butler on  11th floor, 1st, won't let me and my husband to return to the hotel room because we left our passport in our room. then when we check out, insist that she need to collect 170 local currency, about USD60 for power bank usage, which is not even adaptable to Apple 7. Unbelievable!","2","2018-02"
"High Tea","We visited this hotel for high tea which was fabulous!  The food was delicious and the courses kept on coming!  The Burj epitomises the luxury and outstanding service of Dubai. Truly beautiful and it really has the wow factor, from the instantly recognisable 'sail' to the jaw dropping interior.  Booking in advance is recommended as we originally wanted an evening meal but there were no tables available; we were told that the evenings can be booked up weeks in advance.  An absolute treat and we will be returning to stay at the Burj.","5","2017-11"

"Amazing hotel 💕","It was a really wonderful holiday in this amazing hotel. We felt very special. Our butler ALDRIN gave us more than a great time. 

Thank you, ALDRIN, for taking care of us and let us feel at home in the Burj al Arab ! 

The wonderful restaurants, pools, beach locations and bars made us a wonderful stay. 

Thank you for making our holidays to a unforgettable experience for us and for our kids ! 💕

Best wishes from Germany

"Service and Hospitality","The service and food was excellent, with special kudos to Mateus and Mary Zafran who made our dining experience so special. Living in New York City we have the opportunity to experience really fine dining and this experience was at the top of our list.

"Absolutely Appalling worst service I have ever experienced  and very poor quality food spoiled our special anniversary","We visited this hotel in July Last year to celebrate our wedding anniversary with our two daughters. We were so excited and looking forward to such a special evening. We were staying at the Jumeriah beach hotel and choose the upgrade as a treat.

We have waited to leave a negative review, we are still waiting for a response from the hotel which obviously isn't going to happen now so we have decided to write!

On arrival we were wowed at the hotel the staff on entering were very polite and professional. We were directed to the restaurant and sat down. We do not eat meat .
We were shown around the restaurant and the chef informed us what he could prepare especially for our dietary needs. 
We were served old yes cold soup which we sent back. My eldest daughter was served steak which again went back. My youngest daughter choose a made to order pasta dish including vegetables. After eating two spoonfuls she shouted out that it was meat. So the second time During this meal that meat was served this of course was dispite  my husband and I  making the staff fully aware of our non meat eating needs on booking and many times prior to ordering. 
The member of staff blamed the chef, the chef was no where to be seen. We insisted we speak with the manger. On arrival his attitude was somewhat cold and advised that he himself had been served meat when in a restaurant 
 This is not what we wanted to hear. We decided to leave and was given the bill. We could not believe that we were being charged for a bottle of water and three cokes! We had only ordered one drink as that's as far as we had got! Our evening was ruined we were hungry.no of us had eaten. We asked for a higher supervisor who reluctantly was called. Twenty minutes later a suited gentleman appeared and stood at the edge of the table arms folded and asked what the problem seemed to be. We explained that we had been in the restaurant now almost an hour and 30 minutes and informed him what a disastrous evening we were having. 
He eventually agreed to take the drinks off the bill . We left hungry and shocked were we really in the Burj Al Arab ??
The two ""managers"" stood arms folded and wished us a good night! A good night they had ruined our anniversary meal and all four of us were hungry.
We asked for a follow up from the reception on leaving the  hotel. We emailed the hotel. We have never heard anything since. Very poor service 
So my advice is stay away if you plan on visiting this iconic hotel to celebrate 🎉 The other Jumeriah hotels far outshine this one.
We remain shocked and disappointed today.","1","2017-07"
"Drink and snacks at the Sky Bar","Perfect location for a romantic evening. Exquisite list of cocktails. 
The food is okay but the cocktails are unique and amazing.  Bring your pocketbook. 
The experience and the view are worthwhile!  The service is impeccable. Try to get a seat by the window. ","5","2018-02"
"Afternoon tea ","I visited the Burj Al Arab with my family in August. Delighted to be back, as this was my second time visiting the hotel as I lived in Dubai for three years. Afternoon was a delight with an assortment of treats.","5","2017-08"
"Lunch with fam","We had booked ""Scape"" and must say one of the best locations in Dubai for brunch and lazy afternoons..
The entry is strictly on prior booking basis, and we found this the best option out of other Burj Al Arabs restaurant..
The sheesha served by sea is the total value addition..
Its priced higher so make sure ordering should be smart.","5","2017-12"
"Birthday 3 Night Stay!!!!","We stay at many nice hotels and this is by far the best! The hotel is beautiful and the staff is the best and works so hard to meet all of your needs perfectly. We celebrated my husbands 35th Birthday here and they made it amazing for us. Can’t wait to visit again soon!!!!","5","2018-02"
"Best hotel in the world","It is simply the best hotel in the world. I have no idea how they cover the costs. For 1500$ you get 220m2 and the best service. I  have never experienced 220m2 for that price. 

The new terrace solved the only problem of that hotel. It didn’t have a good beach before, and I need beach service. ","5","2017-04"
"Amazing service at the Skyview Bar","My girlfriend and I had booked the afternoon tea in the Skyview Bad as the highlight of our trip to Dubai and we weren't disappointed! The service from all staff members was impeccable and the food + drink was outstanding. We both could not be happier with our time spent there today.

To the management hopefully reading this - please pass on our thanks to Marky who really looked after us and made us feel welcome. His knowledge of the menu and general service was some of the best I've personally ever experienced. To top it off - I left my sunglasses on the chair and he came all the way down to the entrance lobby to find and return them to me! Can't thank him enough. He was a credit to your establishment.","5","2018-02"
"Very good overall but one experience ruined it a bit","I booked the diplomatic suite for our family of 5 adults one child and one toddler.
Pros
The room itself was amazing, have not seen anything like it.

The Terrance and the beach were not crowded and we had fun there

Most staff members are very attentive! Restaurant staff were very friendly as well as the girls that helped us check in Joyce and Valeria.

They even brought in a Thomas the tank engine train with sweets for the kids to pick sweets from. They loved the experience

Cons

When we were checking in, we were early so we were offered to take our swim suites from our luggage and go to the Terrance to wait, which is absolutely fine. And Joyce helped us with this, we went to the little area behind the reception desk to open our luggage. And one of the male staff members walked by, took one look at us and assumed we did not speak English. He said to another staff member, check out, Chinese. Assuming we were checking out. Then he talked down at us telling us to move aside and before I had a chance to reply he again assumed we spoke no English and told Joyce to tell us to move away as people may walk past us. She was very polite to us and did not tell us to move.
I know it’s minor, but for us it’s a once in a lifetime experience to stay in the 7 star hotel and for the price we paid we definitely did not feel like we were treated kindly and with respect from that one staff member.","3","2018-02"
"Self styled 7 starred","Location: In the expat/resort area called Jumeirah. 30 min from airport. The hotel can arrange your pick up at your gate at the airport and expedite your way through immigration and wisk you away to the hotel. It was a very nice service. The beach and the first view of the Jurj al arab is spectacular. It is truly a unique setting on a man made island near the famous palm island. There are things to do outside the hotel but if you stay here you won't want to leave. 

Room: 2 floor 280 degree view of ocean was spectacular. So many delights in the room and the personal butler and concierge is there for your every need. They really do try to delight, and encourage you to use them. I read that there are 7 people assigned to each room. You are provided with a complimentary Hermes perfume set which is mind blowing. 

Amenities: too many to list. AS a guest you have unlimited ""free"" access to so many things such as the Wild Water park, private beach, shuttle to market, many pools, gyms etc. So many things to explore and delight. 

Dining: breakfast is fabulous!!!! We didn't go to tea. We did go to the sky bar and although it was very nice, as a guest ai wouldn't recommend it. Drinks were at least $50 and the view wasn't that much better than the room. Its nice for non-guests wanting to get into the hotel. 

Service: Impeccable. Really special. There are no words, you need to go enjoy it for yourself. Ask them to draw you a bath or take a look at the pillow menu. 

The Burj al Arab is a splurge but it is well worth it.","5","2018-02"
"High Tea","My husband and i couldn’t believe the assortment of food provided for high tea. Everything was top notch. Beautiful place, great views, and excellent service. Glacie took great care of us. And since it was Valentines, they had rose petals on our table in the shape of a heart and gave me a long stem rose and chocolates when we were done! Very nice touch.","5","2018-02"
"Arrogant staff","The staff is arrogant. They pretend they care but all they want is tips. When they enter or leave the elevator they don’t even bother to look at you. The Filipinos and Indians that work there think they own the place. It’s unfortunate because the hotel itself is beautiful. The staff needs to be kicked out Andy courteous people need to be hired.","3","2018-02"
"Afternoon Tea - sky Lounge ","What a fantastic experience! Firstly what a hotel. The foyer was amazing. Then there’s a dedicated lift to the 27th floor and the sky lounge. From beginning to end the service was impeccable. The food was amazing, all
7 courses. We had double of the sandwiches and the scones and pastries were a challenge! Our waiter was excellent, so polite yet with a sense of humour. It Was valentines night and I was given a rose and a box of chocolates! We didn’t have a windows seat but tbh that didn’t matter at all. Still plenty of sea to see! We weren’t hurried or rushed. We asked about going to the Gold bar on 27 and that was all sorted for us and we were taken across. It was an amazing afternoon. Thank you Burj Al Arab. Definitely World Class! A highlight of our trip to Dubai ","5","2018-02"
"Exceptional Attention to Detail","Sensational hotel with truly exceptional attention to detail in the design of the hotel as well as what the staff do to help you. An example... I put some things on my plate at the breakfast buffet and a delightful member of staff came from nowhere and took my plate to my table for me, made sure i had everything i needed (drinks, cutlery etc) and held my chair for me. All the staff here are positive and smiley and mega helpful at all times in a way that makes you feel extremely comfortable about it. Loved our stay here. What a treat!","5","2018-02"
"Beautiful but...","I have booked the diplomatic suite for a weekend. The room and its view is amazing, specially at night. Full of amenities, free entrances to mainly attractions, parks and so on. Butler service 24hr, very responsive. 
Bad point: I had to check out in order to get my flight back to Hong Kong... it took forever... been standing 50 minutes in front of the lobby to settle the extras. Nothing to object and waited for the routing check, this waiting time has killed my good feeling of the hotel just before leaving... pitty","3","2018-02"
"Afternoon tea at the Sky View","Booked this in the UK, just got back after having afternoon tea at the Burj, food, drinks and service were absolutely impeccable, our waiter was Sanjoo he knew everything about the hotel, all the food and wine being served and was a really friendly guy who made sure that our experience was as good as it could be, would definitely recommend the experience and when we come back will do it again with our family, not cheap but certainly worth the money.","5","2018-02"
"Afternoon tea","We had afternoon tea in the Shan Edgar lobby. It’s a two hour experience where you sit looking out of the huge windows facing the road you came in, the beach and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. The staff are all lovely, very attentive and eager to help. We had 7 courses of small starter type portions, savoury and sweet. While at first you think the portions are small by the time you leave you’ll feel very full! All in all a nice experience that I’d recommend you do once. ","4","2018-02"
"Holiday ","Went for a meal and wasn’t disappointed. Wonderful food and such a wide spread decision. Amazing food with an amazing view, as I was sitting next to the window and had a wonderful view over Jumeira beach. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Couldn’t of asked for a better evening ","5","2018-02"
"Place to relax ","It’s near a beach. You can see many people sun tanning and swimming at the beach. With Burj Al Arab, it makes the photos stunning. It’s architecture is amazing and it’s just a building by its own. A place should not miss when u r in Dubai. ","4","2017-11"
"Just once","Visiting the Skybar is worth doing once. NOTE: PRE-booking essential otherwise you will not get past the car/taxi control gate. 
We opted for the 7pm slot. Up 27 stories with views of The Palm. The building is noteworthy though I suspect not the most practical for the owners in terms of good use of internal space. It was and is intended to be a recognizable visual symbol of Dubai. There is a minimum spend per head of around 400 local Ds. Their special Valentine cocktale was noteworthy. Service exemplary.","4","2018-02"
"High tea at Burj Al Arab","We were a group of 20 members and had high tea at Burj al Arab.. “KRISH”, who was our server for the high tea was the person who helped us in getting through in a very friendly manner..He was too polite and respectful. All the group was quietly impressed by his behaviour
And of course the high tea irrespective to say was highlight of the whole trip.. 
Have it on your bucket list ppl.,!😊

"Amazing service ","A special thank you to Ahmed for making our day very special and memorable.
My best friend and I went to the afternoon tea at Burj Al Arab on the second floor.
He found out that we both got promoted and he celebrated us with giving handmade cards and roses and a cake. 
All the staff were very attentive and caring. 
The afternoon tea is at 12:00, 15:00, and 17:00.
We went at 17:00 and there was a live music for piano and guitars. I highly recommend to go at 17:00 because you can relax and stay as long as you wish and enjoy the live music.
In the afternoon, there is Arabic live music but people booked at 15:09 will be coming so it’ll be rush. 
This was my second time and I would like to come back again! 
Thank you to all the staff 🧡

"If you want the royal treatment this is the place to be...","We have stayed at many different hotels as we love to travel. However, we have never received the service that we received at this hotel from the moment we arrived to the time we checked out. They provided exceptional service. All of our butlers were super helpful however, the one that we had more interaction with was Aldrin and he went above and beyond at all times. He always checked in to see if we needed anything. We are definitely planning to come back to stay here. We knew this was a 7 star hotel and expected superior service but they go above and beyond.","5","2018-01"
"Memorable stay","Everything from the check in to the facilities bring you to a truly luxurious experience . We came to celebrate our wedding anniversary , even though we live in Dubai , it made us feel like we traveled to another place . 
The check in and check out are done in the room so we didn’t have to hang around the lobby . The bathroom aminities were full size from Hermes , including perfumes .
The restaurants didn’t disappoint at all , especially Al Mahara by Nathan Outlaw . They recently opened a beach club with a stunning infinity pool . The staff was very friendly and professional. We had a little issue with our room service but they responded very efficiently and with professionalism. 
We will definitely come back and recommend anyone looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion to choose Burj al Arab .","5","2018-01"
"A great experience","Yes the cost will stop you initially but call this High Tea an experience! You can only enter the hotel if you are a guest or dining or have business there: so no rubber necks. My Husband and I booked before we departed from our country. reply from the hotel was timely. suggest you request a window slightly adds to the cost but so worth it. Welcomed by all from the concierge to the waiter. An amazing hotel, great high tea and service. We were not rushed and the staff very accommodating. Take as many photos as you wish and we were provided with a take home box of what we could not eat.","5","2018-01"
"Stunning hotel","The Burj rightly deserves it's reputation as one of the best hotels in the World. They are surprises and delights around every corner. Service is superb as is the food, facilities and views. Can't wait to go back!","5","2017-12"
"Wow effect ","I searched online and found the afternoon tea. Lovely to take my mother to this incredible hotel. You cant visit it if you don't have any reservation. 
Lots of expensive cars around, nice structure and inside a incredible view. Wow!! 

Really a 7 star experience. We did the afternoon tea at the sky bar with a table at the window side. 
The host who helped us was really kind and nice. His name was Sujoy and explained everything and gave us some more stories about the tea etc.
If you want more pastries, sandwiches etc they are happy to serve you. 
Tea, coffee, fresh juices and sodas are all included! 
After this ceremony you don't need to eat dinner. Really satisfaying! ","5","2018-01"
"Great Lunch at Junsui Restaurant 😄","After all the huggling at the souk market, lunch and experience at Junsui, Burj Al Arab was definitely one for the books. Very friendly staff! Very good ambiance! Food is delicious! Super accommodating! Lunch was full of surprises with compliments! Will definitely share and tell this to our friends and family! 😄 Overall great experience indeed! 😄","5","2018-01"
"Stunning hotel","Burj Al Arab is a one of the places I would like to return. I visited there a Posh salon for my hair cut. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning: the floors, the ceilings, decorations, aquarium and staff hospitality. The Posh saloon was very clean and modern. I loved the art pieces at the reception. My hairdresser was extremely polite and professional. Her name was Delphine ( I hope it I spelled like this). She understood my needs and gave me an advise on my hair which I really liked it. Also she made me feel really relaxed and comfortable. After I had a coffee launched. Expect to pay AED 45 or more for a coffee. The atmosphere was very relaxed. The colleagues were polite but nothing beyond that. There are beautiful surroundings outside of the hotel which are great for picture taking. ","5","2017-11"
"Quick Vacation","Went to Dubai for a quick vacation, it’s my go to place for a quick break.
Stayed at the Burj Al Arab for my whole stay. 
Stayed in the Panoramic One Bedroom Suite, the Views were to die for. Absolutely incredible.
Favourite restaurant Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara.
He is one of my favourite Chefs and this restaurant did not disappoint.
Would highly recommend this hotel.","5","2018-01"
"Royal wedding anniversary","Countless fabulous reviews have been posted on trip advisor staying superlatives about the hotel, panoramic suite and so on, hence I will not dwell on them. Yes, all of them are correct and it's indeed a fantasy come true for many of us. The suite is huge, views are to die for and service impeccable. 

We celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary this weekend and for the span of 3 days were uncrowded king n queen. From the moment you enter the hotel till the time you exit every staff, butler and restaurant treats you as an exclusive and important guest. Butler's, straight out of wodehouse or Christie novels, catered not just to out needs but made sure that they became the source of luxury, comfort and relaxation for us. Check in and check out is very smooth, changes to our package was handled smoothly and with zero fuss.

Since it was informed in advance that we have our anniversary we ended up with 4 cakes. One at each of the 3 outlets and one in our room and needless to stay we were overwhelmed with the gesture.

Turn down service on our anniversary night was done with love and thought.

Staffs who made us feel so loved needs special mention, hence my sincere thanks to Xiao Xuan, Jaffer, Uday, Sandeep and Tanuja.

Jaffer we can't thank you enough for your positivity, care, attention and loving gesture. 

We hope we can come soon to soak up this exquisite exp.","5","2018-01"

"Burj Al Arab","The Burj Al Arab Hotel is to die for. Just take a look at it. Beautiful to look at, modern, artistic, comfortable, and exclusive. Inside it got it all, everything that you could possibly need. Just go there and enjoy it! ","5","2017-10"
"Worst Talise Spa ever!","“Jumeirah’s renowned signature luxury experience”, that could be true in many services provided at Burj Al Arab, until you stumble with the experience of the Talise Spa.

I have been to most of Talise spas in Dubai and I love them (the facilities, products, knowledge of the staff, and customer care), am also a regular Burj Al Arab customer (simply because it is one of the best), I have also visited most of Jumeirah properties (simply because they thrive to provide a luxury experience), so I have a Gold Sirius membership.

One would think that three successful brands (Jumeirah, Burj Al Arab, and Talise Spa) makes an unforgettable experience; well, the case is that you have one of the best facilities, products, natural light, and a 150 meters above the gulf surrounded by blue sky and sea, nothing beats that except: 1) a staff without knowledge about UAE policies and regulations, who does not want to admit that they do not know, so they punish you by 2) customer being transferred over and over, and then 3) an aggressive attitude from the management of the spa backing their staff, (all sweet but emotional and a turn off).

So, why does that happen when it must not? It is absolutely because of one factor; the absent minded higher management!","2","2018-01"
"The best hotel in the world","We rate this hotel 10/10. The hotel was clean all the time great customer service. They never said no and always looked into what was asked. Greeted you with a smile and made you feel like royalty. The kids loved it and there was a treat for them every time. This hotel really sets the bar high!!!","5","2018-01"
"Not a 7 star hotel","While the hotel is quite grand, the quality of the hotel is not a 7 star, or even 5 star, property and is in desperate need of renovations. The furniture, and the building in general, is old and outdated, and the food is subpar. The New Year's Eve event was nice, but the food was not up to standard, especially for the cost. 

However, Mandy, the butler on our floor, did everything she could to keep us happy and provided us with excellent service. She was the saving grace to our stay. Some of the waiters at the breakfast buffet were also kind and had great service.","3","2018-01"
"Great Stay","It was great experience but missing some touches to be excellent , but for sure it is the best hotel in the world, for sure I will come back again shortly, the staff was really good and they did all their best to make us satisfied   ","4","2018-01"

"Dining at the Burj Al Arab : Priceless with an eye watering price tag","Given the Burj Al Arab was the first 7 star hotel in the world , our  weakness for ‘rubber necking’ had to be satisfied .  The only practical way to visit a a non quest is to book a restaurant . In our case the La Mahara.  TripAdvisor already warned about the price but it still don’t quite prepare us for a £ 60 starter and the cheapest wine at £25 per glass.  We managed to escape with a £ 450 bill for a starter and a main course each and 2 glasses of wine.  Was it a great meal? In Belfast , Edinburgh or Cardiff in a good Restaurant you would pay around £100 / £ 120 and say it was pretty good meal but not exceptional.  Was it worth the experience ?  It be able to tell all our friends about it including how we cried when we got the bill then yes.  But it is really a true one off unless you win the lottery and even then I would recent giving the money . Fabulous lobby so take lots of pictures including you bill.","5","2018-01"
"Worst service ever","The rooms are excellent all the employees have smile on their face whenever they see u !! But poor communication skills which will cost u too many tensions n irritations !! They Charges me for an unordered food !! After sending several mails they fail to accept their mistake !!

"opulence of the highest order","let me say first of all, we did NOT stay here, we only visited for drinks and nibbles. this hotel is opulence beyond belief, from the stunning foyer to the dancing fountains.
our hotel organized drinks at the burg for us, from phoning for a reservation, to printing our passes off for us. you will be told that there are many dress code regulations to gain entry....twaddle, unless you are dressed like a complete tramp, you will be allowed in, i wore shorts and a shirt. 
before i finish my review i need to boast a little, i made a 7* hotel look like my local pub on a bad tuesday in winter, i ordered a bottle of cider, and they did not have any in the hotel, so it had to be sorced from outside the hotel, which they did, but for a while, i had made them look ordinary (they are anything but).
anyways, back to the review, the dancing fountain does not just dance, i sort of plays a tune as well, i know, i did'nt believe it myself, but you could hear it as plain as day.
there is nothing i can say bad about this hotel, so all i can do is heap more praise on them, and you would soon get bored with that, so i will leave my review here, all i can say is if you visit dubai, you have to visit the burj it is worth every diram......enjoy.","5","2017-12"
"BAA","Very expensive at this time of the year. The security is at the right level.
the access to the different jumeirah hotels and facilities makes you feel having a different treatment.
But NY eve was exceptionnal, real value for money.
The extension to the sea is really amazing.
Overall excellent rating ","5","2017-12"
"Amazing hotel","Stayed there for a couple of nights and it was a bliss. The rooms are big and spacious. The butler services is amazing and they help you with literally anything! The room service is nice and also the food served downstairs at the beach club where you can enjoy a nice shisha :)","5","2017-05"
"Birthday Treat / Celebration","The experience was tremendous, we had reservations about the value for money however come the day we had superb views, excellent service and couldn’t finish all the food presented to us (you can ask for a doggy bag and they’ll happily give you it). Additionally as it was a birthday treat I had forewarned the staff and not only did they give us a mini cake and a rose at no extra charge all the staff wished Lynda a happy birthday (we booked the afternoon tea through Expedia). It’s something you should try as a special treat (you couldn’t afford to on a daily basis, which we are couldn’t). If they offer a window seat it’s an extra 100 AED but worth it.","5","2018-01"
"Flight of Fancy","We decided to take the well most expensive meal in our life £800 for a meal for 2 inc driver etc - 7 courses.

We started at the top in the SKY BAR and you work your way through each resturant and sample the chefs special with escort from the staff between floors and treated like royalty at every stage.

For that birthday or wedding special - highly recommended experience.","5","2017-02"
"Not just a buffet.","I have had the chance with a cruise excurtion to join a buffet inside this incredible hotel: I appreciate the high quality of the wide food presented and the excellence of the service; the structure is simply wonderful, elegante and glam. Top level.

"Terrible experience... cannot understand why people give high ratings...","First, we arrived 3pm for check-in.  Was informed 3pm is guaranteed check in. We booked 2 panoramic rooms.  1 room was ready and another was NOT ready.  waited until 5:30pm (yes, 2.5 hours) for the other room to be ready!   We requested 2 rooms to be nearby but they were many floors apart. While we waited in 1 room, we requested for the luggage to be delivered so kids can go swimming... took over 1.5 hours to deliver the luggage!!  We kept asking the floor butler to check on luggage and they said they called and called... just too busy and not delivering the luggage.  Lame!  We booked 7pm dinner at Pad Thai restaurant nearby and was inform that we can take the golf cart over.  We reserved golf cart for 6:40pm to take us over and confirmed twice with the floor butler.  We went down to lobby at 6:40pm, and there was a line for golf carts.  we asked that we had a reservation, and the concierge didn't care... he said he didn't get any note from our butler.  We waited in line and was late for our dinner.  To get a golf cart (buggy) back from the restaurant required another long wait.  Terrible experience.
The room needs some renovating work.  The iMac in our suite was broken... doesn't even power up.  One of the bath tub water wouldn't stay filled... keep leaking. The curtain makes huge noise when going up and down. 
It might look amazing at first, but once you look into the details, it's old and just not impressed.  The service is terrible.  
To check out, it was just as much a pain... since our rooms are in 2 separate floors, had to go from one floor to another floor to see the specific floor butler to check out each room... and then, there was a line to check out since people were trying to check out around noon.  what a pain. another 40 minutes process just to check out 2 rooms at 2 separate floors. 
For $3600+ per night per room, this is incredibly terrible service and experience.... just not worth it.","1","2017-12"
"Wonderful Stay","Stayed at the hotel over Christmas. Absolutely first class service and facilities. The swimming pool and terrace are excellent. Room was of course huge and luxurious. Beach at neighbouring Jumeirah Al Naseem hotel was lovely. Faultless stay what else can I say ! Thank you to all the staff !","5","2017-12"
"It is really 7th Star!","Just wow! Im completely amazed by the hotel architecture. The interior design of the building was just jaw-dropping. I have never seen such a very luxurious structure. It is a must to visit. My husband and I used our Entertainer Voucher and had booked lunch buffet at Bab Al Yam Restaurant. Evn the food at the restaurant was really delicious and good quality- of course the price is high. This is a wonderful experience. ","5","2017-12"
"Amazing","We have stayed here many times this hotel is simply the best ! 
Pure luxury from the concierge all management and restaurants. 
The rooms are pure luxury never change never date .
The pool area with the new terrace is exceptional the pool manager is great, so attentive you never need or want anything they really do want you to be looked after. 
The sun beds are so comfortable well shaded if you want it, the cabanas are beautiful and will defiantly be booking one in May. 
The floor butlers are great again know you so well and serve you your drink when you want it snacks etc.
The jensui restaurant is outstanding we love it 😍 just amazing staff and manager just great.
Gold on 27 best by far great views great place, lovely drinks and choice. 
Love this hotel see you in May. 
The best part are the concierge who meet and greet outside so lovely we never have to wait on buggies, taxis just great and so friendly. 
Can’t wait to come back.","5","2017-11"
"Disapointed","For such high prices, a guest expects to receive exceptional service and amenities, however, when in comparison to other hotels across Dubai this was not the case. While this hotel has incredible architecture and standards it is no match for other hotels I have stayed in across this magnificent city. The staff seemed bothered to help you and the rooms were begging to look run down. 

The best thing about the hotel was the location and views of the ocean but again, there are several hotels with such luxuries. There is not much which sets this hotel apart from others which are cheaper and of better quality. 

It is a shame to see this hotel deteriorate over the past 3 years I have lived here and hope with time they will live up to this name they have built themselves upon.","3","2017-12"
"Great for special occasions!","We stayed here for my husband's 50th  birthday. 

It's truly a special hotel and a must stay for special celebrations. 

Fantastic suite, excellent staff and impeccable service. 

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a memorable holiday.","5","2017-11"
"Awesome experience","The rooms are 2 floors. Its huge for 2 person. Lots of freebies including fruits, bottle of wine, their delicacies in a box thats a shape of burj al arab hotel. All the toiletries are HERMES! Talise spa experience was great 👍🏻 they have many pools that I lost count lol with a nice view of sunset! And our butler showed and tour us to a Royal suite which is a hotel room with its own elevator 😍 Over all a wonderful experience. Will definitely stay here again 👏🏻","5","2017-09"
"Mix pleasure with excellence","It’s been 14 years since our last visit, and i can honestly say the gold has not tarnished one bit. We were a party of 8, started with excellent cocktails in GOLDON 27 then Al Mahara for dinner. food prepared to perfection NATHAN OUTLAW knows his business! 
Well recommended and reasonably priced. The is a private room but smaller aquarium, the live action in the main tank is amazing","5","2018-01"
"Great experience at breakfast ","Awesome menu for healthy choice. Kids had to opt for continental as no kids menu and that was a bit of a rip off for the price as it only came with croissants and a drink. The hotel is beautiful and we were allowed to stay as Long as we wanted in the atrium area. Gorgeous Christmas decorations too","4","2017-12"
"New Year 2018","We recently stay in 2 bedroom suite from 29/dec - 2 Jan 2018. The hotel, it’s room & all of it’s facility are very very old it is 3-4 star & really need major renovation. The room charge is ridiculous, should worth around $200-500 but they charge $6,000-$8,000.

The new year gala dinner was a rip off, it worth maybe $200-$300 but they charge $2,400. 

I strongly recommend people stay in international chain hotel where they have good service & clean standard facilities.

This hotel is not worth to stay, please don’t try.","1","2017-12"
"Special Celebration","We booked a special lunch for my mother as she was celebrating her 91st birthday. The service was exquisite and very one was polite and very friendly. The food was out of this world and plentiful, such variety and quality. Towards the end of the meal 4 staff came in singing 'happy birthday to my mother' and brought with them a tiered chocolate cake with gold lettering on. Once the staff moved away another member of staff came in with a bunch of roses for my mother. She was over whelmed by the attention she received. A great day, a fabulous meal and great service. A must visit to this hotel.","5","2017-12"
"Simply Disappointing","So this is new for me: I'm actually writing from the desktop Mac in our room at the Burj Al Arab. And while I loathe saying anything negative, I just felt compelled to log in and share some details re our unusual and frustrating short stay.

We're at the Al Arab for one night only, and hoped for a memorable evening in Dubai as we make our way back to Los Angeles. Not to be, I fear.

In no particular order:

The hotel can't seem to figure out how we're getting back to the airport. Maybe Emirates. Maybe a hotel car. Maybe at 5am tomorrow morn. Maybe at 6:30. Not the end of the world, but we've now spent more than an hour trying to figure it out with the floor concierge. Lesser hotels handle stuff like this in their sleep. Can't figure out the issue.\

We were delighted to hear at check-in that we were being offered a free room upgrade. And then amused to hear that, unfortunately, no better rooms are available. Again, not a huge deal. Just odd to remind guest that they're NOT going to be getting special treatment.

Oh, we were equally thrilled to hear we'd be getting a complimentary 50-minute massage. Except, well, the spa is fully booked and so ""unfortunately, we're not going to be able to offer that either."" As above, on some level just amusing. But a strange moment at a $5000-per-night hotel.

All of the above was just... odd. Not even frustrating. Just strange given the hotel's reputation and the remarkable number of staff on property. A little unsolicited advice: just don't offer the perks if you can't actually deliver. Save the poor staffers from the awkwardness of having to offer and apologize, offer and apologize. But just my two cents.

But truthfully, none of that matters and I wouldn't even be writing if those were the only issues. Here's the problem: the Burj Al Arab can't accommodate my wife and I for dinner in the hotel.

Not at any restaurant. Not at any time.

Wait, I take that back. There's apparently some sort of buffet in the lobby. So, that. And we'll go... and it'll be fine... and I realize how petty I sound complaining about this.

But it's just baffling to me that a hotel of this caliber can't swing a dinner reservation for guests.

Admittedly, some of this on our US travel agent. I asked for the dinner reservation when we were booking the hotel. I even named the preferred restaurant and time. And for whatever reason (maybe the agent, maybe the hotel) we got here to discover it hadn't happened. So there's a little blame to go around.

But again, a 5K-per-night luxury hotel rolls with that and feeds their guests. They find something outside the hotel and arrange a car... or they offer to do something en-suite... or they put up a table on the patio... or, well, ANYTHING. Instead, the concierge stood in front of me, did her best to smile, and said ""unfortunately, we will not be able to provide you a table anywhere this evening.""

I've asked to speak to a  manager. Maybe they'll call, maybe they won't. And we'll make a reservation elsewhere, book a car, salvage the evening, and have a great time. But for all sorts of reasons little and big, the Burj Al Arab just hasn't lived up to expectations. Lesser hotels routinely do far more to accommodate their guests. Disappointing, for sure.","2","2018-01"
"It just doesn't get any better than this!","I have been fortunate enough to stay here on four separate occasions now. It is absolutely seven stars. You hardly lift a finger, and your Butler does everything for you. Views are spectacular. I have stayed in both a one and a two bedroom suite (when we traveled with another couple). Never had any issues at all. It is a shame that you now have to pay for the Rolls Royce to collect you from the airport - that used to be included in the price.... but you can order and pay for one if you please.","5","2017-11"
"Pampered high tea","Came here especially for top-floor afternoon tea. Totally pampered with the exquisite menu and views. Love the champagne cocktail and all savory and sweet snacks on the sail-shaped shelf. Great service.
Note: modest dress code and reservation in advance is required","5","2017-12"
"Worth every Penny!!","Wish there was a way to give it 
“7 stars “ because that’s what it deserves.
Stayed a week and never left the hotel campus  
To expensive to just stay for one night as you cant possibly get the feeling of true luxury that quickly 
We Eat at all the restaurants and all were other worldly 
They let the tour buses only eat on the first floor so all The specialty restaurants are reservation only with the best table held for guests of the hotel  
Skybar was a blast and also no minimum if your staying here  
Attention to detail was perfect everywhere throughout the property  
The staff was spectacular they made my wife birthday a very special celebration 
Wish we could have stayed FOREVER ","5","2017-11"
"The Most Impressive Panoramic View!","You must have already heard enough and seen enough about this hotel. The only info I will provide is that since I have stayed in their one bedroom suite, two bedroom suite and the Panoramic suite (very limited), it is the Panoramic suite that's the most impressive.  Though the room is a bit more narrow and slightly less space (which is still enormous), the floor-to-ceiling glass window spanning over two floors offers a panoramic view of both city and the sea from our bed.  It is one of the most memorable moments in my whole life!  It's like we are sleeping in the sky with the world underneath!  Truly impressive!","5","2017-05"
"AMAZING!!!","Hands down the best hotel experience ever!!! We stayed here just one night, but would have loved to stay forever! From the room, to the food, to the service, everything was exceptional! I cannot praise this hotel enough as it was the best I have ever stayed at. We enjoyed every moment here, and would definitely be back in the future. The spa and pool were incredible and the service provided was top notch! Well done Jumeirah properties!! Also, one thing that really stood out was the bed and pillows. I have a hard time sleeping in hotels, but sleeping here, I was able to enjoy one of the most comfortable sleeps ever!","5","2017-02"
"Excellent, but going down","It was out 8th time there. We love the rooms, the service and the atmosphere and the new pool is very nice. Our last stay was 5 years ago and we really see the difference, but not for the good. 
They are small details but they add up. For example:
- arrival, no more date at entrance
- lobby, no more Buhur or oud sent, the smell in a hotel is very important and gives its identity. Now nothing
- too many day tourists taking pictures everywhere. Not so exclusive like before
- outside fountain show with fire, not happening anymore
- lobby is a bit dead at night, no music or when there is, musicians take too many breaks
- my daughter had a wax treatment at the spa, needed to pay cash ! No room charge possible
- not enough buggy, too long waiting time
- breakfast quality and choice very limited.
- new pool is very nice but many rust in the pool. Really not acceptable building quality for the Burj
Those are details but they add up and they make the difference between good and excellent. 
Hotel competition is tough in Dubai, but the Burj should always remain well above the crowd and I am afraid it is not going the right direction. 
I urge the new management to restore the exclusivity of the hotel. The infrastructure is there, but the soul is going away. ","3","2017-12"
"One week holidays","We have been in many places, hotels, in many countries, but this trip and hotel is probably the best. Very friendly staff, always trying to help. 

The hotel is really huge, but not overcrowded at all, we visited neigbouring hotels Jumeraih, both was full of people everywhere. The interier is “rich”, its not my preferable style, but it looks like great for people who like it. The construction of the Building is incredible. We even wanted to learn more and looked video in youtube about the construction. 

There is always places in the beach area, in the pool area for the resident of the hotel only. Buggy service is quick and convinient, if you want to go to aquapark or to other places. The weather was great, around +27 in the day time and around +22-23 in the evening.

When you are comming to the pool, the attendant immediately brings you a small glass of juice, cold fresh water in the bag, cold towels. Attendants are always ready to help you, to bring towel, to open umbrella, to turn it or to do whatever you asking them.

Its always available consierge service 24/7, which can help you in booking, to give some advices or to call to the doctor. My older son was sick and has high temperature. The consierge called a doctor, asking if need to bring medicine or some food or some other help needed. Later on bring a gift with the card for quicker recovery. Asking next day how is him, is he better and so on. 

The breakfast is very good and for all tastes, however it could be a bit differences in offers day to day. There is 2 places where you can have Your breakfast- tradicional one or Asian one. Both are very good. Asian breakfast is more than a breakfast, its more like a lunch :)

Cleaning of rooms are perfect. Simple perfect. I usually always complaining on something :), but here even me cannot find even some small detail to improve. There is full size of Hermes cosmetics the bathroom when you arrived. 

The private transfer is perfect. We ordered it from Abu Dabi airport and back. The driver was polite and helpfull, even gave us a small lesson about history of the country :) When we came out from airport the driver gave flowers (roses) to me and my daughter (5 years old) and toys to both children. Its a small thing, but its really appreciable. 

The Spa & indoor pool is also very good, however the pool could be a bit bigger, but taking into account that there is separates pools and areas in Spa for men and women, it is ok :) 

And finally. We have been on Christmas. And the real Santa came to the room and bring gifts for everybody. For us, for children. Real gifts. Hermes cosmetics, wine for us and toys, books, sweets for babies. It was so huge surprise for all of us. We did not know about such tradition in the hotel, we did not wait for that .... simple open the door and the real Santa comes to you :))

I can recommend this hotel as for travellers with children, as well as without. Everybody can find here things which they like to do and for adults it is not look like its “baby hotel”, as the hotel and areas are really huge. 

Thank you the hotel, thank you the staff, we for sure will be back to you and will recommend to our friends and collegues Your services. ","5","2017-12"

"I Bet you cant have more Luxury anywhere in the world","It is rightly said the most luxurious hotel in the world. i stayed there in their 3 bedroom suite which was on the top most floor with a whopping approx 8000 Sq ft are for the room. everything in the hotel was perfect and you can even think of anything can be improved. amenities in the rooms were from the best brands of the world. we were with our kids and Kid's cot was in every rooms, well decorated keeping the needs of kids in mind.
hotel lobby in mind blowing. all the rooms are duplex rooms .

in your life time you have to stay at least once in Burj Al Arab if you want to experience the Best. 

you can experience the best of the car rides in the hotel.

i got the chance to ride in Rolls Royce, Ferrari which will remain with me forever.","5","2017-01"
"Decent but over hyped","The hotel is the icon of Dubai and prob the most famous hotel. 
Yes it is a lovely hotel but it all depends on your taste.
Staff : very good and professional. 
Food : very good but slightly over priced
Decor: not to everyone’s liking, too ott for me, Liberace would feel at home here, the furniture is  worn and looks old. 
Location :convenient ","3","2017-04"
"Hotel Amazing but the Aquarium Restaurant is terrible!","I spent 2 days at Buji Al Arab. The Hotel is amazing, everything is very clean, organization level is higher and the staff is very friendly. We slept in an amazing Suite on the 12 floor, the room has 2 floors like a duplex and with a lot of amenities (2 Hermess Eau De Toilette 50ml- 1 bottle of French wine - fruits - arabic sweets ect...). 
after our check-in (in our floor - there is a desk for each floor) I asked to the front office to book for me one table for 2 people at the famous restaurant Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara and the staff told me that it was full. So I went down to the lobby and I thought to ask directly to the Restaurant Reservation Desk and the girl told me ''are you guests inside the Buji?____ Yes of course! When you want to come your table is there!"". 
But anyway the restaurant is so cool! The staff here is so poor! They did not ask us how was the dinner, the food was not tasty, they did not take the menu but after 30 minutes I asked to eat something!We received one cold soup which was terrible like all following food! Also, we asked to talk with the sommelier about the wine, he came after 20 minutes and we told him our order. He told us ''this is the red wine list-white and champagne"" and came back to the kitchen! that's it! NO COMMENTS.The dessert was terrible! and the worst thing was that the staff did not ask us why we did not eat.  the bill?ridiculous! 
The only good thing was that we met one Italian Team Leader who works there and he tried to solve our complaint. So Thank you very much Davide! you are amazing! 
The hotel is amazing but they use the Brand: we can do everything and if you have complaint does not matter! they do not care about your satisfaction.  
My suggestion is: go there to sleep and to spend your time there but don't eat!!!","3","2017-12"
"Excellent Afternoon Tea","The hotel is amazing & the views of Dubai are incredible. Afternoon tea was great & they catered well for gluten free. Make sure men wear full trousers as they won’t be allowed in wearing shorts. I definitely recommend this experience for a special occasion. ","5","2017-03"
"Wonder Hotel ","The most special amazing hotel we have ever stayed and visited.

From the moment you arrive and have your private check in, the butlers unpack your case to the moment you leave it is a truly wonderful experience.

The Burj Al Arab is a famous hotel but it is so much more than a piece of architecture with an amazing pool and restaurants. It is about true service of the highest order.

I cannot thank our super Butler Aldrin enough. He has put a sparkle on our stay and we will remember him forever. 

Everything is high end and everyone working here goes so far to help.

We are 100% going to visit again soon and will request Aldrin as should you. 

It’s a massive highly recommended hotel from me. The best we have ever been to in our travels throughout the world.

"Great View, Drinks and snacks but be prepared to pay for it!","My wife and I really enjoyed this bar, it’s probably more formal than we had hoped with more of a restaurant feel rather than a bar atmosphere. We were extremely lucky and had one of the seats with the best views. We arrived for 7pm which was perfect timing. The staff are brilliant and friendly. We are used to London prices however this place is EXTREMELY over priced. Expect to pay the equivalent of £30 drink (G&T/Cocktail). Even a bottle of Peroni was £12. ","3","2017-12"
"A fabulous night to remember","We went for dinner in the international buffet and we were greeted by a lady called Ana who was amazing at her job she was very welcoming and showed us around the dining area and took time to explain the food dishes and how the system worked. Are server was Edmund who was a lovely guy and served us very well. It was my fiancées 50th birthday and the staff came out with a cake and sang happy birthday which was a lovely touch and something we appreciated very much. 

Next a special man came to our table and introduced himself as the manager of the restaurant this man was very polite and pleasant and made us feel at ease. This man’s name is Prashant Pinto he just made our night even more special in this beautiful master piece of a hotel. We both wanted to see the sky bar and Prashant brought both of us up to see the sky bar and explained the views and showed us around. Prashant then brought us to the entrance and wished us good night and safe journey back to our homeland Ireland. We were very grateful to be able to have had this dining experience in this beautiful place and will be a memory we will never forget and hold closely in our hearts.

Thank you to you all

"Visiting for dinning","I visited today with my mother and sister for dinning.
It was wonderful and fantastic place, we took a very nice family photos.
It has different restaurants at different levels.
It's actually seven star hotel and place.","5","2017-12"
"High tea was distinctly average","I really wanted to be impressed and the hotel foyer gives the right image but the food not 7 star.
We had afternoon tea and there were finger sandwiches with smoked salmon, egg, coronation chicken an cucumber. They were fresh and tasted ok but they didn't peel the cucumber.
Next were scones, these were still warm and were OK, probably at least M&S standard.  I didn't like the way they served up the clotted cream and jam on to the side plates.  The jams were too runny.  You didn't get offered any extra scones.  
The tea itself was good.
Next the cakes, of which I expected Bake Off standards.  What a disappointment. 
Two were basically tray bakes and cut into squares.  A cheesecake and chocolate sponge.  There was also a fruit tart which was nice.
No Mille Fuille.  Nothing that took effort. I felt let down.
It was a nice experience but over priced and wouldn't go back.  The service was good.
The British do it so much better at a third of the price - try Chatsworth House","3","2017-12"

Our first visit to Burj Al Arab to have breakfast with a stunning view. Shaheen and Saleh are the perfect hosts, we felt very welcome and thoroughly looked after. We especially love the attention to detail to everything - the coffee, the Healthy breakfast in the morning which were different in that morning,  We didn't feel the need to leave the lounge at all because there was the perfect balance of being left alone and making sure we were looked after. Thank you defiantly great experience for us.","5","2017-11"
"A breakfast event at the Burj Al Arab can never go wrong! ","Have attended several banquet functions at the Burj Al Arab on their 29th floor but must say that events that involved their breakfast are supreme in offerings as well as hospitality. They are worth the money & guaranteed to make your event look very impressive. ","4","2017-12"
"First class, even by Dubai standards","Had afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab and had a fantastic time. Very impressed. The service from start to finish was absolutely first class, even for Dubai where the service is usually impeccable. Everybody spoke very good English, which is great for such a diverse place. The hotel itself is beautiful and seems to be ever-changing through very clever lighting. The foyer takes your breath away. The outside elevator was very quick and silent and even for someone who hates heights, was quite comfortable. There is also an indoor elevator to the restaurant too, for those who can’t bear it but as I said, even for someone like me, it was quite comfortable.
The food itself was excellent and I had their signature cocktail creation which was expensive (160 Dirhams) but very special. 
After our meal we wandered about for a bit and the concierge hailed us a complimentary golf cart to take us to the Madinat, the hotel on the other side of the causeway from wild wadi and the jumeirah beach hotel. The madinat was very impressive and the driver gave us a nice tour, stopping to take our photo at the best spots.
Would highly recommend but will advise that you can’t get in unless you’re a guest or have a booking. ","5","2017-11"
"Luxury experience but service could be better","First night of my holiday with mum at Dubai, really enjoyed the suite. Luxury details with spectacular view day and night! Facilities were great and swimming with sunset is something I can’t complaint...had a cocktail at Skyview bar after..perfect! Only one thing disappoint me is the lady at our floor. Lack of manner and no greeting at all, attitude was not something I expected at this level of hotels! Luckily the customer service manager turned up and solved this out which made us feel more comfortable...recommend for those would like to embrace a luxury experience!","4","2017-02"
"Mrs. Muzammal ","
We visited burj al Arab on November 11th, 2017. My husband made reservation at the Sahn Eddar for high tea. The ultimate tea experience was awesome. Jefrey Garcia was excellent. He provided us lots of information about how tea is made. We loved hearing all the details from him. He is such a knowledgeable person. We would love to come back and experience the fabulous high tea again. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Dubai.","5","2017-11"
"Afternoon Tea","We visited the Skyview Bar for Afternoon Tea in early November to celebrate my wife’s 50th Birthday. We found the whole experience to be amazing. The service was outstanding (thank you to our waiter Marky). The food and drink was stunning and plentiful (7 courses). The surroundings second-to-none. Although expensive, the experience was something we will remember for ever. The Afternoon Tea lasted for 2 hours, but once finished you are allowed to enjoy the surroundings without being rushed. We would recommend visiting the private beech before you leave. A lovely experience at the Burg Al Arab. ","5","2017-11"
"Impeccable Luxury!","One of the easiest reviews that I have made.  This hotel represents the highest level of quality, luxury, and customer service.  We travel with our two kids, the staffs level of attention to our kids was amazing, from nightly delivery of goodies using thomas the tank engine, to ensuring they were safe around the pool area, absolute perfection!! The terrace pool are and surroundings were beautiful, great service all around, immaculately clean, and fabulous service all day and night from across the hotel.  The kids club was fantastic, and we highly recommend Gold on 27 for some great cocktails and views (whilst the kids were entertained at the kids club).  The breakfast buffet was great, and the food quality across the restaurants within the hotel was brilliant, not to mention the staffs level of excitement and ability to make us feel special.  Complimentary access to wild wadi water park, complimentary Hermes perfumes, and loads of other gifts including cakes and drinks for the celebration of our 10th year anniversary topped-off an amazing and unforgettable stay.  We will be back!! loved every minute of it and it truly is an unforgettable experience! Well done to the entire team that makes this hotel so amazing.","5","2017-09"
"Feels like a typical Vegas hotel","This hotel is an impressive one, but it’s not that much different from being in a 5 Star hotel on the Vegas strip. I once heard that the Burj should be the first 7 Star hotel in the world. I would have to disagree with that. However, the cars pulling up outside the Burj will be unlike any cars you’ve ever seen before - so have your camera ready, if you’re into that. The Afternoon tea in this hotel is one of the most generous I have experienced. Not only will you be given large portions to start with, but servers will continuously come around topping your food up and encouraging you to have more. ","4","2017-03"
"review of world famous Berg Al Arab Hotel","total extreme luxury in the hotel, it's rooms, restaurants etc, very unique experience, fabulous pools plenty of privacy. glad i treated myself. One bedroom suite was so spacious, large bathroom, in room office plenty of closet space.","5","2017-11"
"Very good ","Fine stay, actually we expected more professional check in and check out service.
Also the room are a little bit old fashioned.
If you are interested in shopping I wouldn’t recommend to stay in this hotel, try some thing near the shopping centers.

"High Tea WAS AMAZING!","Would definitely recommend the High tea, service was incredible, food was delicious and lots of it - recommend not eating before you go! 

Definitely would visit again - 100% worth the price as well! 

It was my nans 70th Birthday and they made it a very special occasion, that none of us will forget.","5","2017-11"
"Excellent service and staff","I recently spent 5 days at the Burj Al Arab. My suite was stunning, excellent views and very calm and quiet. The butler service was very convenient for every conceivable request from tailoring to wake up call to booking restaurants and taxis. The swimming pool area was conveniently located beside the breakfast room. we had the option of a sand are or pool area to lounge. The selection of restaurants meant we didn't have to venture too far. I played polo every morning, my breakfast and taxi were right on time.  My polo lessons were booked through the hotel before my stay. A real treat.","5","2017-11"
"The Best Hotel in the World","We have just finished a 3 night stay at the Burj and to say it's exceptional is an understatement.
Everything in this hotel is exquisite and even though it may not be to everyone's taste I found it amazing. Ok if you wanted to pick small faults I'm sure you could but out expectations were surpassed with the service, facilities and the ambience the hotel has. 
The butler on each floor is very helpful and the rooms are cleaned twice a day and the turn down service is lively with sweet little gifts left on the bed each night. I definitely recommend the panoramic suite as it's much larger than the deluxe and absolutely worth the surcharge with breathtaking 270 degrees views of dubai no matter what flor you're on. 
Will definitely be back but have to save up first as this hotel is not cheap but worth every penny.
Also definitely use the private beach club where the service is just as good.
","5","2017-10"
"Afternoon tea in style","We visited the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea, having booked on the spur of the moment. The level of service provided was fantastic, as was the Arabesque style tea. There is typically a dedicated waiter, dealing with only a couple of tables. It put an interesting slant on the traditional English tea. The cake stand was simply to die for. All in, there were about seven courses, including drinks. Tea and coffee was also included in the price. Our server was also willing to describe each course to us in detail.

We had an additional treat provided by Marionette, the shift manager at the time. She went out of her way to provide a personal tour of the Skybar on the top floor. This gave fantastic views over Dubai.

The Burj Al Arab itself it certainly an interesting place, and a masterpiece of modern architechure. It really is worth seeing from the inside. However the liberal use of gold paint on the columns is perhaps not to everyone's taste.

Overall I can highly recommend this as a bit of a luxurious indulgence. The number of Rolls Royces and Ferraris outside stand testament this, and you really feel like you are mingling with high society.","5","2017-11"
"Worst experience","Faisal security did not let people in even we wanted to Stay in hotel. I will never stay in this property, even we had a booking that night. The worst experience, I couldn’t even enter the property because of security problems.","1","2017-11"
"Birthday cocktails ","We visited the Skybar for cocktails to celebrate my 40th birthday. The staff are so warm and friendly and couldn’t do enough to make the experience special. Brilliant views of Dubai in 7 star luxury and they even brought out a birthday dessert for me. The cocktails are brilliant and I would recommend to anyone who want to celebrate in style","5","2017-10"

"Once again a magnificent stay, they cater for your every need","The Burj Al Arab is truly one of the worlds great hotels, the service and facilities continue to surpass expectations. Our recent 14 day stay, was faultless, the entertainment deck and beach club were great places to relax","5","2017-11"
"Uber-luxury, outstanding personalized service, and the ultimate ""Burj"" experience.","My wife and I have just returned from a trip to Dubai, and an unforgettable stay at the world renowned Burj Al Arab hotel. The service, care and thoughtfulness afforded us throughout our stay was nothing short of outstanding. In particular we want to acknowledge and thank the various butlers, Aldrin, Tali, Prianka, Gregory and Anthony who were never more than a short call away throughout our stay, and who waited us on hand and foot, managing to know what we wanted and needed almost before the thought had entered our heads, and served us with unending patience and smiles, even when they were busy with other matters related to the requests and comfort of other guests. We were presented with complimentary roses, a cake and sparkling date juice when it was discovered that we were celebrating an anniversary, and after a chance meeting with the amazing Chef Stefan whilst wandering around the grounds were also surprised with some extra chocolates and petite cakes sent to our room to welcome us to “The Burj” and wish us a memorable stay.
 
Aziza our server at the sensational Bab Al Yam restaurant and Abbas at the ‘Scape Pool and Terrace also provided us with excellent and unobtrusive service when we ventured out from our luxurious apartment. We had an amazing breakfast at the Bab Al Yam restaurant sitting outside on the terrace looking out over the surrounding blue waters toward the Jumeirah Madinat complex and Palm Dubai. Paddleboarders and kayakers moved serenely by and jet skis whizzed around silently in the distance providing a vibrant scene of activity and fun in the foreground.
 
The greeters who offered us cool towels and welcoming dates when we entered the hotel, the endless staff asking after our comfort and enjoyment of The Burj in particular and Dubai in general, and every staff member we encountered during our stay went out of their way to ensure no opportunity to help improve our stay and ask after our comfort and enjoyment was ever missed.
 
We couldn’t end this review without highlighting the first person to greet us and the last person to bid us a safe and comfortable onward journey, the beautiful Kate. She adopted us as if we were her own parents and ensured that nothing that we could possibly ask was ever too much trouble. She gave us a fascinating tour of, and orientation to, the Burj Al Arab, escorted us to our room, checked us in, and ensured that we understood all the features of the room, its amenities and the services available to us. Only when we were completely comfortable and settled did she ever leave us, and she made it her mission to constantly and discretely check in with us to offer her assistance and that of the team at the hotel. We were genuinely very sad to say goodbye to the amazing staff at “The Burj” when it came our time to leave but we have already promised to return in the not too distant future to visit our new-found friends and family at what truly is the world’s most luxurious, service-oriented and welcoming hotel.","5","2017-11"
"The worlds most luxurious hotel","I have got to say this hotel really does live up to its reputation as ""the worlds most luxurious hotel"" I have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world and I can confidently say this is a 7 star hotel. 

When you arrive at the hotel you are greeted with exquisitely dressed door man and front of house staff they look incredible. Not only are they dressed exquisitely they are the best in the business the service they provide is fabulous extremely happy and extremely helpful. 

You are checked in at your suite which I think is fantastic no waiting inline every suite has the use of a Butler which is great. I had organised a surprise for my mum as it was her 60th I had arranged for afternoon tea in the suite and asked for it to be decorated. The room was decorated fantastically loads of pink balloons my mum was very surprised she absolutely loved it and the afternoon tea was great. The staff serving the afternoon teas could not do enough for us it really made the experience perfect. 

The pool area was brilliant we sat right at the bottom by the infinity pool which was also like being sat on the beach as the beds were on sand. The beds were very comfortable indeed we did not want to leave them. Again the service we received by the staff was unfaultable, they could not do enough for us and were always smiling and happy. 

We all loved our suites they are very luxurious, comfortable and clean. I have to say everything about this hotel is 7 star we did not have a single complaint from arriving to leaving. I will be back and I will recommend to everyone. It is expensive but worth every penny.","5","2017-11"
"List for words, the Burj made me feel like the privileged super rich.","What can I say ...... we stayed here for 4 days. Over the top?yes, Did we feel special?yes, was the service impecable ? yes, expensive? yes, an experience of a lifetime yes?was I left wanting more?no,worth every cent ?Absolutely!","5","2017-10"
"The Ultimate 7 star hotel!!!","I've just been wowed!  I've been around the world twice - never have I experienced the level of service that I received at the Burj Al Arab.  From the minute you walk in the door - they greet you by name (sent from security at the gate) to the butler that walked me out to the car to take me to the airport - it was the most fabulous hotel stay I've ever had.  And besides that - the view is amazing.  The service is beyond excellent. The spa massage was wonderful !!!   It's definitely worth a bit of a splurge!  Go for it and enjoy!","5","2017-11"
"Best vacation ever","We don’t have enough words to express ourselves to say how amazing was this holidays. The staff is amazing. The hotel is marvelous. The beach is awesome and all the jumeira resort is exquisite. A special thank to Mr. Mandal who treated us very well. See you next time.","5","2017-11"
"Feeling Rich.","Me and my friends booked their Afternoon Tea in the Sky View Bar. A personal butler will serve you wine, various  sumptuous finder foods and  your choice of tea.  You can see birds eye view of the The Palm and the Jumeirah Hotel. The place is cozy. In the bathroom they use Hermes  Perfume and lotion.","5","2017-11"
"amazing lobby","walk in the front door to a spectacular entrance with massive fish tanks either side of escalators leading to lifts and a great water fountain feature. Brights flashing lights. Great restaurants and bars","5","2017-11"
"Once in a lifetime experience","I decided I wanted to stay one night at the famous Burj Al Arab for the once in a lifetime experience of it and I was not disappointed. The hotel certainly has everything you could possibly need and then some, but one of the things I appreciated the most was the staff. They were all incredibly warm and friendly and very professional, made me feel as ""at home"" as I could in a $1900 per night room ;-)

I got the cheapest suite I could find, which gave me a living room with dining area, work space with a Mac and printer, downstairs washroom and a lovely staircase (that was an ornament in and of itself) up to the master bedroom, master bathroom and small hallway with closets. There were so many complimentary things with the suite I'm quite sure I left with bags fuller than when I arrived.

The bathroom was a dream, with an enormous shower (with great pressure and temperature control) and a jacuzzi (which I struggled a bit with operating, but that's my own fault as my room's butler had offered to set this up for me, but I declined).

The bed was extremely comfortable, the food (I ordered room service) was fabulous and the list goes on. 

I also went down to the manmade beach with infinity pool and killed a couple of hours, so good.

The only negatives I can mention is that I was trying to watch a movie with my dinner, but the movie froze so I had to restart it twice. When it froze the second time I gave up as it was getting late. I also received a complimentary beach bag with the BAA logo on it which I was super excited to take home as a memento, but the strap broke the day after I left even though I didn't overload it at all (had a sunscreen, a book and a shawl in it). I was hoping for better quality given where I got the bag, but then, mine might have been a fluke, I don't know.

The best part was the staff though, I never felt out of place here, even though I am not a member of the ""1 %"" ;-)

To sum up I would say that the Burj Al Arab is definitely worth a visit once in your life.","4","2017-11"

Food was delicious, service outstanding and lovely live music to enjoy while dining on the magnificent lobby level. ( men need to have long pants and no sport shoes for the top level). No matter, this was perfect! At the end of our meal we were pleasantly surprised with two decadent chocolate mousse cakes, candle , music and a rose for me. What a lovely touch! Thank you Gaurav, Durga, Krish, and Glacie for making our day at Burj Al Arab very special . ","5","2017-11"
"The One...","I was there for an event and enjoyed every moment of it with their high quality. The way they treat you is their difference for sure. The way they serve even the water is different,. If you want to have special treatment in Dubai go there and enjoy the difference.","5","2017-11"
"Afternoon Tea at Sky View Bar","This was our second visit to Sky View Bar for afternoon tea. It holds a very special place in our hearts and always manages to exceed our expectations. We were celebrating my Mum’s birthday and the staff couldn’t of done more to make the afternoon perfect. The gave my Mum a birthday cake and a single red rose. The staff are fantastic, incredibly friendly and the service is always impeccable. Many thanks to our waiter Sotau for the lovely card he wrote to us both. To top off what was already a perfect afternoon, the restaurant is currently offering a ‘Dinner on us’. They choose a table at random within the restaurant and settle the bill for you. Highly recommend for special occasions. We cannot wait to go back, again! ","5","2017-11"
"Lovely staff","The rooms were very nice and spacious. The staff were lovely and quick to act.
I just felt like it is a bit over hyped. The lobby is very underwhelming, there are escalators which I guess with the layout are necessary but they just cheapen the look and there are constantly people coming in to take pictures Overall you don't walk in and think wow luxurious. I found some things in the room to be a bit dated e.g We had to get up to control the air conditioning.","4","2017-06"
"7 Star ⭐️Amazing Place ! ","To start this sentence I have to advise that when you come to visit Burj Al Arab be prepared to understand this concept architect ( realized dream ) 
This wave is a dream come true !!!! Read about the structure and how it's build to understand what are you to experience about !!!!

The Rolls Royce that takes you there is Amazing !!!! You will not regret for anything !!! 

The way this beautiful masterpiece sits in the Sea is astonishing . 

From the entering the hotel to the last detail in Baba Ganush or Traditional tea , the plates , cups glasses , the clean detail ... this place will offer sophistication , glamour and treatment like a king . 
Gold , concept design , diamond service and sophistication in every aspect !!! 

The hotel management is 7 star 
Everything is simply the best !!!!

"So much more than a ""bucket list"" location on your race to the grave","So I guess most people around the World will have heard of the BAA and some will have read the reviews on here and a guess a few will have it on their bucket list of must do activities before departing this mortal coil however the BAA is so much more and so much better than that, though if the coffers are limited, definitely make it a bucket list stop.
I live in Dubai and am fortunate to travel around the world with my work and get to experience a range of accommodation from the very basic to pretty special dependent upon location and country and do have a couple of special places that I am fond of, such as the Kerry in Beijing however nothing, absolutely nothing prepares you for the BAA.
I wont say its the best hotel in the world for everyone as its very subjective, you may think that a hotel at the end of Ringway airport in Manchester is special if its where you scrub out your last remaining aircraft registration number from your book of registrations or you might think dangling your toes into the sea off the pristine white beaches of the British virgin islands is best, but i will say that the BAA is my best hotel and perhaps the most luxurious hotel in the world bar none.
The meet and greet by name as you exit your car at the entrance sets the tone for what you are about to experience, the staff are impeccably presented and friendly, and the view as you enter takes your breath away, it is simply stunning, nothing less. The suite check in (shared with the Kerry) is fast and efficient and the 2 storey suites are spectacular, so much so that i had to drag my two reluctant to move young children out of the suite, as they wanted to stay there all day. Everything is silent in the rooms and it is the perfect environment to relax if you live in a high pressure environment. I cannot believe any hotel can offer a more luxurious room and so many other posters have commented on the superb large bathrooms that I wont expand on their words, they are that good. The relatively new pool area is wonderfully presented and staff immediately guide you loungers, and then follow up with cold towels and bottles of water. The children spent a very enjoyable afternoon by the pools and my wife and I enjoyed the waiter service for the afternoon.
A highlight of the visit and a personal bucket item list activity for me was cocktails in the sky view bar. Here is a tip, if you are visiting in summer when the days are longer then reserve a seat by the long elevation of the lounge, if you are visiting during the shorter days of winter reserve a seat by either of the ends, reason being is that the view from the long elevation will be spectacular as the sun sets during summer whereas the shorter end elevations are superb when the sun has set, which it does relatively early in Winter. There is a very diverse and comprehensive range of cocktails on offer though being older and a bit traditional didn't see anything on the very large list that appealed so requested a Brandy Alexander (last seen in the very early 80's). The bar head came over and then spent a good few minutes questioning me on my taste in Brandy etc so he could make one just right. Well he did and it was superb as were the ones that followed, just perfection and it made an evening that was already special, just that bit more so. Thank you BAA and the team in the sky view bar.
One tip for the world's last remaining smokers, the sky view bar and the communal areas are all non smoking as one would expect but there is an adjacent bar next to the sky view bar where you can nip out for a smoke and as expected they have a superb range of cigars.
Though it seems a little savage to only give one sentence to the food, it was as expected flawless in presentation and superb to the taste.
So to sum up. If you can stretch the pennies then stay at the BAA once in your life, you will not forget it and it will be superb. If you have the opportunity to take an extended stay there, then do so. Dubai has some excellent hotels but nothing compares with the BAA. It is so much more than a bucket list location to cross off. I intended to go once before I pass on but will be back and am already planning for a significant wedding anniversary there next year rather than travelling overseas.
I would say i would ignore some of the comments on Trip advisor, if someone thinks it a bit naff to be greeted with your name upon arrival, well thats their prerogative, I thought it was wonderful and as said, it set the tone for what was a memorable stay that we all enjoyed and we all will remember for ever","5","2017-10"
"An extravagance, but think of it as a Broadway musical! equivalent!","I thought my travel mate was nuts when she said this tea was the one thing she really wanted to do in Dubai. But I'm so glad I said Yes. The building interior lives up to its reputation for beauty and elegance - not gaudy gold but brilliant design in mosaic floors, carpeting, furniture. We were so pleased we arrived in time to tour the lobby and ""first floor"" for 45 minutes before going up in the panoramic elevator for tea. The Sky Bar is lovely, and we were delighted we chose a time when we could watch the light change as the sun set. The service was top-notch. The food was generous and beautiful and delicious. They didn't push us out when we stopped eating, and they didn't push us to spend extra. It was a lovely luxe experience. Treat yourself!","5","2017-10"
"10 years on","Great to stop off for a few nights and new deck makes all the difference to the Burj experience
Excellent breakfast but stick to Junsui for the international fare

"Breathtaking!","During our week’s visit to Dubai, we were taken as a treat to this hotel for lunch. For us,lt was a once in a lifetime experience. Approach over the bridge, up the drive and pull up alongside the Rollers, Bentleys etc. Valet parking so the car doors are opened for you and you just walk away and the staff give you a receipt for your car and park it for you. The four of us went to one of the outside bars for a couple of drinks in the shade, then up to the 27th floor for a very nice champagne lunch. The views over the sea and Dubai are wonderful, the food and service are worth the 7 stars they have been given. An unforgettable afternoon that was the highlight of our week.","5","2017-11"
"The Cabana Experience","We did not wanted To stay at the hotel, but we tought it would be a great idea to spend a day at the pool and To enjoy the private beach. Our expectations were 100% met. It was a very nice
Combination of beach and pool. Staff was really nice and food was great as well.  Prices are Sky high, but we believe that it was worth it. ","5","2017-11"

"For your eyes only","This a a thing to do once in a life (at least!). 

To enter and visit this beauty is imprescindible to book. Probably you think is a huge amount of money to spend in one of the luxury rooms...but don't worry, if you want the experience of admiring this wonder (it is consider one of the modern wonders od the world!) one good idea is booking the Skyview bar (located at the top level of the hotel) for an afternoon tea. Then you can enjoy it while you drink a glass of fine champagne with your favourite tea with cakes and sweets. It is really worth living (for 150-200 euros)!!!","5","2017-09"
"Travellers paradise!!","Though being the topmost 7 star hotel in the list for years in a row, BURJ AL ARAB never fails to fascinate the visitors by ensuring great facilities, the essence of luxury by surpassing all the limits at the time of vacation..Helicopters, sports cars, swimming in infinity pool,  fancy dinners, private islands..imagination is the final frontier.

"Indulgence at its best ! ","My dear husband booked this beautiful hotel for my surprise birthday treat . 

We visited this hotel about 6 years ago and I have to say was much better second time  around .  The suite was delectable , pure elegance, beautiful. 
The beds are the most comfortable beds in the world , I never wanted to get out of it ! 

I can't comment on breakfast as I never made it , as I said the beds are to die for . 

The pool area has much improved to say the least , you can hire cabanas around the pool with butlers , there are two types the top one being the royal cabana . You will pay for everything in this hotel so be prepared for a big bill when you check out !! 

We dined in the hotel every night and had the most delicious meals every time , Al Mantara  is a real treat , wonderful French cuisine , you must try the tasting menu . 

The sea restaurant by Nathan out law is very special , Al Mahara is situated at the very bottom of this glorious hotel . Out of this world interiors with a menu to boot , be prepared to spend a small fortune in here . 

My only gripe was service , 5 years ago it was over the top ridiculous attention . This time we were forgotten a few times in relation to room service . Turn down service got forgotten twice , we had to prompt them for service which wasn't good .

"Luxurious experience","Visited here several times during my 2 month stay in Dubai a while back. This hotel is mostly famous because of its luxury so everything - inside and outside - looks shiny. Even the toilets look like luxurious living rooms.
I had the Arabic dinner buffet at one of the restaurants, which did taste good. The service is obviously first class, they literally do everything for you, from moving your chair to pouring your glass of water. The way to the bar at the top is something somehow amazing, from the elevator you can see everything form high up. I went there at night every time so couldn't see much outside but must be good during the day. The top bar has very tasty cocktails. If you like luxury and you're into this kind of stuff, then this is a to-do experience in Dubai.","5","2016-11"
"Just do it","We had a high tea lunch ( 7 course) at the Burj al Arab. It is someting ....just do it! Wonderful, nice people who let you  feel like a verry importent  person. Food is amazing and then  we are not talking about this beautiful 7 stars hotel inside. We could order all kinds of coffees and thee, and we needed a doggy bag to take some food home. Thank you for the kindness that we could walk around see the hotel every were it was no problem at all. Verry kind and helpsome employees 😀","5","2017-10"
"Best ever experience","To celebrate my Daughters Birthday we booked High Tea at the Burj Al Arab as a treat the experience starts as you ride over the Bridge to being welcomed by staff at the Entrance.

As you walk inside you are blown away by the quality starting with the cascading fountains indoor aquarium then up to the first floor we were lucky to have a window Table to enjoy our 7 course Tea nothing is rushed the presentation and quality of the food is exceptional enjoy every moment.

The staff go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect plus as it was a Birthday she was given a rose and small Birthday cake. It lasted nearly 2 hours.

After Tea we asked if we could visit the Sky Bar which we did amazing views of Dubai and the coastline.

Overall makes a memorable Birthday you do need a reservation to visit the Hotel cant just turn up.

Thank you to all the Staff for looking after us so well.","5","2017-10"
"Beautiful Room Great Service","We went here to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The room was amazing and the views were spectacular. We booked a panorama room with views of the city and the Gulf. The room itself was expansive with two floors. The windows were enormous, and had powered remote control shades so you could block the sun and at night close the shades to block all outside light. The restaurants all served excellent food and the service was top notch. The pools and the grounds were amazing and really must be seen. Overall expensive but worth it.","5","2017-06"
"2nd visit","Just come back from a 7 night stay in Dubai, 4 of which we stayed here at the one and only Burj al Arab. We were lucky to have stayed here last year and could not wait to return. 
We had an over night flight and was given a room on arrival at 9am which was fantastic as my little boy was able to have a small sleep and be ready for the rest of the holiday. 

The rooms are fantastic two story suite which occupied 3 adults and one child easily. As we have been her before we knew what to expect. I must say the service wasn’t as 7 star as it was last time, little things like the Hermes products we had last time were amazing, although there was still some given, no shower gel, shampoo or conditioner for my husband, he had to use the female one. We were not given the beach flip flops and cushioned slippers like last time. Little things like this which we picked up on.
Also last time we went half board the Asian restaurant was included however this time there was a 395 Dirham supplement, and the now Arabic restaurant was previously a fusion with Indian food. So personally half board was not as good as last time for us.

The major positive is the new infinity pool which was just incredible. The views and the feeling you get there is priceless. 

Breakfast as brilliant, with my little boy telling everyone that the best waffles ever are from the Burj Al Arab!! And I cannot disagree. 

The free entrance into the Wild wadi was beneficial and my little boy loved it, defiantly the better water park if you have small children in comparison with the Atlantis as that park is aimed for thrill seekers whether this is still relaxing and not like butlins 

We cannot wait to go back again next year. Hope the little niggly things will be improved on though. ","5","2017-10"
"Honeymoon Treat","My wife and I were in Dubai on our honeymoon and I booked to take her to the sky view restaurant at the top of the Burj Al Arab.

From the moment we walked in we were blown away with the hotel. A taxi dropped us off by the door and we were escorted straight inside.

The lift was easy to find that took us up to the top of the hotel and even though this was a glass lift and I don’t like heights it was still a good experience.

The staff that we encounter were all very helpful and friendly and made us feel at ease through the whole experience.

My wife was presented with a rose and we were given a cake that said “happy honeymoon” on it on the house.

The food was exquisite, very good value for the money. There was so much that neither of us were able to finish it and I pride myself on being a big eater.

I would highly recommend this for anybody looking to make a break in Dubai extra special.","5","2017-08"
"Best Birthday Ever!!  ","Since living in Abu Dhabi for the last 3 years, we have often passed by this hotel and mused what it must be like to stay in such an opulent place.  Then there was my birthday!  We got the room with the panoramic view.  Every suite is two stories with bathrooms upstairs and downstairs.  The staircase rivals anything from Tara in ""Gone With the Wind.""  The staff ensures that your every need and desire is catered to.  If you have the opportunity to stay at this hotel, it is truly a once in a lifetime sort of experience.","5","2017-06"
"Wonderful Anniversary treat.","We celebrated our wedding anniversary by enjoying a scrumptious high tea in the Skyview Bar. Everything was spot on right down to the care taken by the team regarding my husband's allergies. Thank you for our afternoon and for the surprises. You spoilt us and we hope to be back very soon. ","5","2017-10"
"Burj Al Arab - A Surreal Experience! It's everything & more I imagined it would be...","Breathtaking!  It's a place you have to stay at to cross off your bucket list & it should be on your bucket list!  
The whole experience is absolutely amazing. 
A night of drinking with friends turned into I don't care how much it costs I'm booking a suite here. So thank you vodka!
The decor, the staff, the suite...everything made me feel like a princess. ","5","2017-10"
"Memorable ","Me and my little girl stayed in Al Naseem for a week followed by two night in Burj al Arab. 
When visiting Dubai, any Jumeirah property is a must for your stay! The service is exceptional, and all the staff are fantastic with children! 

We managed to get an early check in, which was fab! We had a little gift waiting for us in the suite, a soft toy with my daughters name on it plus a t-shirt along with a gift for me which was really nice and in-expected.

We made use of the facilities, such as the kids play room on the 18th floor. 

The pool at the back is great great ( for adults ), but not child ( toddler ) friendly ( that would be my only negative comment). 
The only splash pool that was child friendly was adjoined to the terrace restaurant where we have breakfast and it had no fountains or and fun factor ( unlike Al Naseem ), but then again Burj is aimed more for adults! 

Our butler was exceptional  - anything we needed she did for us. Little thing like getting full fat milk warmed up for my little girl for bed time - she knew the timings and delivered in time without me needing to chase.

I'd say if you want to have a treat while in Dubai then you must stay here.

The breakfast was lovely too - everything you could wish / want was served with great views too! We spent at least an hour and a half eating as we tried everything 👍🏻
Highly recommend!","5","2017-10"
"A perfect 10!","Once in a life time experience.we stayed in a dlx 1 bdr sutie with city view.me and my wife,stayed 4 days celebrating our aniversary.The unique attention and the beaytiful cake we received  made us feel like small children celebrating their birthday.The suite is decorated in extravagant gold colors,but beautiful. We received daily fresh fruit and a new bottle of wine.overall service is the best we ever received in a luxury hotel.BUtler service is excellent,and Gerald our butler did an exceptional job.It`s an expansive hotel ,but worth it.","5","2017-10"
"Cool way to spend the weekend","So the Burj Al Arab - the worlds only 7 star hotel. We are lucky enough to have stayed here before and out last visit was awesome- this visit had a lot to live up to!
We had an early check in which was great. Out Butler was a lovely lady but, we had a bit of a language barrier.  Never mind - no reason everyone should speak perfect English after all. It worked in my favour when my husband orders drinks I got two bacardis - he didn't get his Gin. Why he didn't correct her I don't know.
The new pool deck is lovely. Not sure there is really any need for the sand on it but the actual pools are great. The service around the pool can't be beaten. All pool attendants were polite, kind and really seemed like they couldn't do enough for you.
There were a few little luxuries we missed from our last visit. We all missed the complimentary afternoon tea in our sweet, the kids missed the sweet train and I missed the Hermes bath cubes. Also the full size Hermes body lotion had been replaced with two small sample size body lotion in a different fragrance 😳 how disturbing 😂
We ate in Babal Yam which is a typical buffet style restaurant. Food was tasty but may be not as much choice as some places. I think this made it nicer in a way though as it was all quite fresh and hot..
Anyway it is worth a visit if you have never been before. And if you have been before it is still quite special. I am pretty sure we will go again. Despite the 7* rating it is a very relaxed and friendly place to be.

","4","2017-10"
"True : One and only 7 star ","I visited Burj Al Arab when i was on my honeymoon. We chose restaurant Sahn Eddar. Burj al Arab is for no doubt best hotel in the world. Everything was amazing from the entrance to our exit. Staff was amazing(amazing is still for me not justify their smiles) food was awesome. I must say that was most expensive dinner of my life but money well spent. 

I suggest readers to must spend a day/night if it is in your budget. ","5","2017-01"
"2 week stay at the wonderful Burj Al Arab!","We have just recently returned from a 2 week stay at the world famous Burj Al Arab which sits on the wondering Jumeirah Beach in Dubai. The service is first class which is expected from a hotel of this standard and this price. Although the hotel is very expensive (costing us just under £22,000 for 2 weeks for the two of us) it is still so worth it in every way. We stayed in a Panoramic Suite which was amazing and worth every penny. I would recommend this hotel to anyone , the best place we have stayed in Dubai. We are returning in February but want to try out the Jumeirah Al Naseem as have never been and looked gorgeous. We will be back soon to stay at the Burj Al Arab again , hopefully for 3 weeks next time 2 just wasn’t enough!","5","2017-09"
"Afternoon tea in the sky view bar","Wonderful tea with champagne at the top of Burj lovely food 

Fabulous views amazingly expensive the lobby is awe inspiring with gold leaf everywhere 
The taff are charming a once in a lifetime afternoon tea","5","2017-10"
"5 year anniversary","We loved our stay at the Burj Al Arab and would rate this resort the best we have ever stayed. The staff and butler service were first class. The beach area and attached infinity pool were awesome!  Thank you.","5","2017-10"
"Impressive anniversary present and family gateway!","For those of you not familiar with the Burj Al Arab, it’s a self-proclaimed seven star hotel, and was so expensive to build that they apparently don’t know the cost.
once you see the prices of the stay you might not consider it for your usual holidays, but once you experience the services that comes with the price and the delightful hospitality, outstanding amenities and the gorgeous suite with the breathtaking view, you give it the credit of a 7 stars hotel.
I surprised my husband with a weekend stay for our anniversary as he always wandered how the rooms are( which are all suites), even after describing them to him as I stayed before there, I didn't feel like he had a proper idea about it so I decided to let him decide himself about it, and his reaction was priceless!!! he was simply over the moon and couldn't help to hide his joy with that that he spread it all over his blogs and networks which made me super happy as that's the purpose of any present given, you just want to make the person super happy.
now lets point what burj al arab has that other 5 stars hotel don't have.
THE SERVICE. top notch, you feel special
THE PRIVATE BUTLER; Mr Tushar went above and beyond his duty to make our stay memorable and wonderful. many thanks to him
THE RESTAURANTS AND THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD AND ASSISTANCE OF THE STAFF; thumbs up to all and a special thanks to the manager of bab al yam mr YURIC who couldn't be more kind and welcoming.
the terrace and the pool are sooooo amazing, the view is breathtaking, my kids were delighted to find out about the kids club, the staff in the terrace are amazing. mr marwan assisted us with a lovely smile and always been checking on the little ones. 
check in and check out soooo smooth, the valley parking and the welcome is 7 stars worth.
were we please to stay there?? 1000%. was it worth it ?? yes yes yes.","5","2017-10"
"It’s worth the notoriety ","Absolutely wonderful stay. The property is magnificent. Well maintained, great service, lovely views - and it’s truly a Dubai icon. The staff go out of the norm to make you feel comfortable. Truly spectacular. ","5","2017-10"
"This place is extra AF","Came to the Burj with some friends to go Gold on 27. Superb cocktail menu. They also bring out a tasty bowl of these seaweed chips that are bomb. The hotel is unique and luxurious obviously. I don't support aquariums or zoo's but that said the aquarium tanks there are massive and pretty impressive. Lots of gold and purple lol. But I dig it. Crazy cars pulling up constantly, like a stretch limo Dodge Charger. Check it out, its cool. Try to get a tour of the top suite ;)

"Our 5th Stay","We had our 5th stay in September at Burj Al Arab. It was just as good as the first! The staff are wonderful and it is great to catch up each time we return. I highly recommend this hotel, they will spoil you like no other.","5","2017-09"
"Quiet just how I liked it","Fantastic break for 7 days 

Staff remembered you and we loved nearly every minute

The sauna was down for 5 of the 7 days and for me the visit to the spa wasn’t worth it due to the spa being out

The steam room is looking tired with small tiles missing

The shower gel dispenser was broken and a wheel had come off the sunbed in the spa mixed pool

The asian restaurant was immaculate

European breakfast was only missing the beans though very accomodating

Our room looked newer than last year although the curtains broke on the 5th day and could not be repaired but we where offered a new room not worth moving rooms with two days to go

All in all an ok stay compared to last year

A big thanks goes out to karan who organised our.mcdonalds proving the burj al arab is about the customer

"Amazing hotel that lives up to the 7* status","Burj al Arab

We stayed here as a family of 5 (3 young kids) for a short staycation. We had a wonderful time in the hotel, especially the new swimming pool / cabana area. We spent hours at the pool - it was so calm, relaxing and offered amazing views. 

The suites are quite old fashioned in decor (in the 90s?) but still eye catching as they exuded lushness and luxury. Very well appointed suites. 

Buggies are available to take guests to the next door jumeirah beach hotel where you get more dining options. It is really convenient. 

The sky bar interior is a bit tacky and drinks are obviously expensive but it's a place to go for the experience. We still enjoyed ourselves.

Breakfast was relatively good. We only ate at one restaurant and it was not too bad (although water costs way too much 55dhs for a bottle of aqua panna but I guess that's what you pay for a 7 star hotel!?).

The kids loved the candy trolley that came round in the afternoon and they could take as much as they wanted!

Indoor pool pretty small but we didn't use it. 

Overall it was a nice experience to stay in the hotel that is world famous.","5","2017-06"
"Iconic hotel","Burj al Arab is a 7 star hotel in dubai, the hotel symbol use to represent in past. Constructed in 1999 and one one beast and must watch place in life time. The interior showcase Arabic transitional colour and one of the luxurious interior. The hotel had few restaurants that will charge 250$ per a pax. Reservations are mandatory to enter the hotel and stay will cost starting 1600$ minimum range. The hotel had a private beach access and hotel will be seen across beach area across dubai.","5","2017-10"
"Afternoon tea","Excellent selection of food and teas to choose from. Staff were attentive and gave a full description of the courses being served. Sky lounge as breath taking views of Dubai. Try to go on a clear sunny day.","5","2017-09"
"Afternoon Tea","Yet again , an unsurpassable experience with top quality service and fare. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Dubai and a great way to celebrate a special occasion, especially if you book a window seat. Value for money, considering it is a six star hotel. Plenty of 'Wow...'
factors.","5","2017-09"
"Honeymoon ","The hotel is beautiful and update they have some much things updated. They deserve the 7 start hotel since everything is beautiful inside and out side the services was awesome!!!

The scenery from the entrance was very welcoming. The waterfall fountain presents a serene quaint view.
- Value for money","5","2017-07"
"Cocktails","After last fantastic visit for afternoon tea, I wanted to try the skybar in the evening.

Staff as always very attentive, the bar was very busy. I prefer afternoon tea as this was exceptional and I could appreciate the views.  

I love this place even for just a visit and cannot recommend highly enough. Such luxury!","5","2017-09"
"High Tea - WOW","We had high tea here and although it is very expensive this is a once in a life time experience. The service, food and of course the stunning view were amazing. 
The food was plentiful and delicious, the service is what you would expect for a 6 star hotel. We arrived a little early and were privileged to have a look around the Burj 
Al Arab. This place is just so grand, the walls, ceilings, floors and chandeliers. we were the taken up to the 32nd floor in a glass elevator (stunning)  to the sky lounge and bar.
Be warned you cannot get inside the gates of this magnificent hotel unless you have a booking at the restaurants or you are a guest of the hotel and there are dress regulation's that become more intense into the night.
A must see if you are ever in Dubai.","5","2017-08"
"ULTIMATE AFTERNOON TEA","I pre-booked afternoon tea at the Burj after being told it was expensive, but very good. Yes it wasn't cheap but the quality of food, standard of service and the overall ambience of the Hotel and the Sky view Restaurant Views are all incredible. I fully intend to pre-book it again next time I go to Dubai as it was an experience to savour. There is a huge amount of food to get through and the 90 minute slot you have (we went over by about 20 mins) means you do not feel rushed.","5","2017-10"
"Dubai by night,  highlight was SKYVIEW BAR IN BURJ AL ARAB","We had a memorable experience of a lifetime,  the comfort and luxury of staying in the SKYVIEW BAR even for just a couple of hours made us feel like we belong to the royalty.
Staff were accommodating and welcoming.","5","2017-10"
"Magical","This hotel is the most well-known hotel in Dubai for a very good reason...IT IS MAGICAL. Not only is the exceptional service one to be noted, it makes everyone feel like royalty. The hotel is certainly well designed and maintained and has not at all shown signs of wear since my last stay in 2012. Truly a once in a lifetime opportunity to stay here and you will enjoy every minute","5","2017-08"
"Beautiful backdrop!","I would highly recommend a visit to this beautiful place.  We went later in the evening and had the dancing fountain in the foreground with the skyscraper in the background.  It truly is a magical experience and one I would recommend to see.","5","2017-08"
"Royal Suite - The best for a company of friends!","This was the best 2 weeks of my life, having fun parties and a stay at the best hotel in the world were top notch! The royal suite and rental of 2 luxurious vehicles were the dream holiday come true, I really wish to come back very soon!","5","2017-09"
"Wow!","Visited this hotel last year as a 'one off special' because of my husband's 70th birthday - only problem was, it was so special, we had to go again this year!  Thoroughly deserves its' 7* rating - although it is VERY expensive, it is really worth it for the attention of the staff to every little detail you could possibly want.  The infinity pool is to die for and we spent the whole week lying around.  We went in October last year, which was probably better weather wise as slightly cooler, but the breeze was perfect.  Would thoroughly recommend it and, funnily enough, we met a couple who we had first met last year standing in the same pool!","5","2017-09"
"Stunning Hotel ! ","We stayed here for 4 nights. We were met at the airport  by a private chauffeur sent by the hotel. The whole stay from start to finish was amazing. The staff are very inventive. We stayed in the panoramic suite and the views were breath taking. We had access to the wild wadi from the the private beach so didn't have to queue. ","5","2016-12"
"Really the best","You have to stay as a hotel guest, to visit all restaurants, the SPA, swim in all pools to feel all the luxury and brightness, A suite with butler service, who will help you and will master all the problems which might be. Our butler was from Pakistan named Haseeb, best educated and competent. He made us a unforgettable stay.","5","2017-09"
"A truely memorable stay","From the moment we were met at the front door to the time we left we were treated like Royalty.  All staff were too class.  The facilities were excellent.  We couldn't find anything negative to say.  Everything was too notch.  We will be back some day.  Thank you all for making our stay so memorable.","5","2017-09"
"Breathtaking luxury and opulence","Oh my goodness, what an experience. The styling is not to my taste, I like a more subtle style of glamour. However, I defy anyone not to me impressed by the quality, detail and style of the place - it simply is overwhelming. The cocktail bar at the top of the hotel is a huge amounts of fun, and the basement restaurant makes you feel you are in a James Bond movie. The staff are friendly and unbelievably attentive, and you are certainly made to feel you are special.","5","2017-08"
"Birthday and Anniversary meal","We arranged a 3 course meal here for my birthday and our friends wedding anniversary. The food and service was excellent. The drinks however were outrageously expensive, We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London and expect drinks to be pricy but these were beyond that. A basic bottle of wine was well over £120 as was half a bottle of Champagne Bottle of water was £12. Too put it into context a bottle of Chablis usually £10-£20 at Tesco was over £300. We are all glad we went and enjoyed our visit in this iconic hotel but would not go back","4","2017-09"
"Pure Luxury","We stayed here for 1 night as a treat and it surpassed our expectations. Everything from beginning to end was exceptional. The item that left me in awe (other than the building and the views) was the customer service in which the staff delivered and prided themselves on. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone and you were always greeted with a smile and a hello. Congratulations to all the staff on this exceptional quality, it really does make a difference.","5","2017-09"
"Bucket list still not ticked ...","I have visited Dubai three times previously in the last ten years and every trip I have included a visit to Burj al Arab. The first time I went for drinks with friends in the Skyview Bar.  The second time I had afternoon tea with my husband and children at Sahn Eddar.  The experience was so wonderful that I came back a few years later to treat my mum to afternoon tea there.  My fourth visit to Dubai last week was with just my husband to celebrate our 50th birthdays and our 21st wedding anniversary.  It has been a dream of mine to actually be able to stay at the Burj so we saved up in order to treat ourselves to two nights here.  
I'm happy to say that it exceeded all my expectations.  All the staff were so friendly and welcoming at all times.  There is a butler on every floor.  He was never intrusive, just always friendly, polite and greeted us by name every time we walked past.
The suite, (there are no rooms, just suites) was out of this world.  Huge!  I booked us a panoramic suite - floor to ceiling windows.  Obviously the decor and furnishing are opulent and garish and most definitely not to everyone's taste.  But if you overlook that, it is what it is - just wow!
Going the extra mile: Roses on our bed, little gifts of eye cream, silk cleaner (?!), cuticle cream, a tiny bottle of perfume.  A pillow menu containing a whole list of different pillows so you couldn't fail to find one that is just right.   In the bathroom, full size bottles of Hermes perfume for her and after shave for him, not to mention full size bottles of Hermes shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  Gold fittings everywhere.  A massive jacuzzi bath. Enormous shower cubicle.  
Breakfast at Bab al Yam on the ground floor was fantastic.  A buffet with a huge variety of fayre including a chocolate fountain!  Again, all staff were so friendly and happy to ensure you had everything you needed.
The pool terrace.  Just beautiful.  Comfortable loungers.  A cool bag containing bottles of water and a face mister.  More helpful staff to make sure you had enough towels and drinks.  Ice lollies brought round, as well as popcorn and nachos.
I wanted to stay at this hotel so that I could tick it off my bucket list.  Well,  I haven't ticked it off because I most definitely want to come again, only I want to stay for more than two nights next time!  Yes it's expensive, but for the experience I would highly recommend it.  I just love it here and I was so sorry to leave.  We moved on to another hotel for the remainder of our trip and of course it didn't quite match up to the Burj.  
Needless to say,  I'm saving already for my next trip to Dubai and a longer stay at this beautiful hotel.  If you can, do it!","5","2017-09"
"Birthday ","Stayed here a couple of times,this time we just went for dinner and the Experience was fantastic as always a must go place.

"Penthouse like no other","I stayed for 3 nights in the Penthouse and was enveloped by Middle Eastern Luxury almost immediately. Meeting with Government Bankers is normally quite dull; however the magnificent surrounds of this leviathan of the hotel industry made my work so much more enjoyable.

Without a doubt this is a magical experience and worthy of your consideration.","5","2017-09"
"Something to tick off the list","Best hotel in the world ? Maybe . Best afternoon tea ? No. However having said that I'm still giving it five stars as the overall setting makes the whole experience very special .
The tea itself was seven courses.  All courses tasted good. The staff that greeted us and served us were very friendly . They checked on us throughout. Nothing was rushed . Such lovely ladies. They took photos for us and at the end brought out a cake with a candle as it was my birthday ! Lovely touch. 
I'm glad I got to experience this but for what you pay you are just paying to be at the Burj. ","5","2017-08"
"Absolutely exceptional from start to finish!","We checked into the Burj al Arab to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and received exemplary service from start to finish and in particular from our butler, Tushar, who made us feel like royalty! We were upgraded to a club suite which was unlike any club room we had seen before - a 450 sqm duplex with panoramic floor to ceiling glass - which was the icing on the cake and made our stay even more memorable.","5","2017-09"
"Afternoon Tea Was An Expensive Gluten Free Mess!","I booked the Burj Al Arab for Afternoon Tea as a Birthday treat for my wife for our last day in Dubai.
I rang up to book so there would be no confusion that they could cater for my wife's gluten allergy and that they could offer us a window seat. The woman I spoke to on the phone assured me that as a seven star hotel my wife would get a gluten free afternoon tea as delicious as my own and that they could offer me a window seat for an extra 100 AED.

After reading the glowing reviews I decided the £260 price tag would be worth the seven star culinary dining experience along with the amazing views! 

We arrived in a limo taxi as I thought the extra would be worth arriving in style, my wife and I had dressed to impress with my wife wearing an expensive dress and heels. Straight away my wife was saying omg I've over dressed, people had pretty much under dressed for the occasion as if they were going shopping for the day!
The hotel itself is gaudy and like someone who got dressed in the dark, there's no fineness its very tired and worn. We stayed in the Atlantis Palm and that was way more impressive and well worth the five star tag.

The lift experience to the Skyview Bar was very good, and the views from our seats were amazing but that is where it stopped! The waiter checked about my wife's gluten allergy, and then brought out the first course Chocolate Petit Pot, this was an amazing desert and then it all went down hill from there. The second course came out which was a tiny quiche, and I questioned that it was gluten free? the waiters face turned to horror and he whipped it away and came back seconds later saying the chef was making something special! he came back minutes later with a tiny salad saying this was an artichoke salad, we both looked at each other in disbelief and I said excuse me my wife is gluten free not vegetarian. The waiter then ran off with the salad and said it would be 10 to 15 mins as the chef was preparing something special yet again, it was a chicken dish which my wife said was very nice. Why did we have to go through all that? the hotel had known for weeks my wife was coming so why were they so unprepared? The next course was sandwiches and mine were nice but my wife's gluten free bread was dry so she left some. Next up was the cake stand which I can honestly say was a massive disappointment there was only one cake that I liked and that was a chocolate slice, the others I tried lacked flavour and all had a pastry base, and the fruit cake was dry and just fell to pieces; I decided to just leave it at that and left most of the cakes. My wife's gluten free option would turn out to be even worse than mine! They could only be described as flavourless gelatin on top of various biscuit bases, one looked like  wallpaper paste  that had set in a bucket then cut into a neat shape to place on top of the biscuit. Next came the taste test; now I try all my wife's food as it is so hard to find nice gluten free food, absolutely disgusting and all I can say is the chef must not taste his own food! One of the biscuit bases was so salty you may even think the chef picked up salt instead of sugar when making it!  one of the deserts was granola rolled into a ball with a blob of jelly on top, SEVEN STAR HOTEL? I called over the waiter and was explaining exactly as I have written in my review and he couldn't stop sniggering, then seemed to find it even funnier that I had spoiled his moment as he had a single red rose and a birthday card to give to my wife hidden behind his back! I demanded to see the manager who couldn't apologise enough and said he would refund my 100 AED which is about £22, then disappeared and returned with a bunch of roses.. YOU ARE KIDDING ME! Our last day has been completely ruined and you offer me £22 of the £260 I have paid? I was absolutely fuming!

The Atlantis Palm where we were staying managed to make fantastic gluten free cakes and food even at short notice, yet this is only a five star hotel.

I did eventually after a lengthy email manage to get  a refund of 410 AED which is about £89, which I am not happy about at all. If this had happened at the Atlantis Palm I know for a fact after speaking to their management the whole bill would have been waived with a huge apology!

The whole holiday in Dubai was amazing and our last day should have been one to remember, but was tainted by an arrogant and ignorant waiter and the incompetence of a so called seven star hotel!

"A bit too much!","A bit too much if you ask me!
it is really an average hotel! it is just that they fed you the idea that it is very exquisite, and because it is expensive you actually believe it is ""THE HOTEL"", it is NOT!

Food wise: 7/10

Privacy: 5/10
Ambiance: 5/10
Pillows: 4/10  :'(
Service: 8/10
Staff: 8/10

Money: 0/10 (super expensive), i really thought it would be an experience f a life time, but it wasn't, but however, i did enjoy my time, because I just love to be happy anyway :D, but you must understand that it is my mindset not the hotel!!!

they do have variety of places to go to, restaurants and such, but it is kind of a dull place to be at!
my overall experience is quite ""meh"" 5/10 i would rate it at tops","3","2016-10"
"Still annoyed ","Been here for 4 days we have another 4 left ,I am still quite annoyed by what happend to us on booking the burj al Arab ,after loving the hotel last year we decided to book again and the burj then brought out an offer last month which I made enquiries  was I entitled too I was flatly told no after the money I have spent here it's left a bitter taste in my mouth,after discussions with my agent I was offered that if I paid an extra 500 pounds I could which of course I refused I have already paid more than last year to be here .i was offered  a free cabana   for the day which I suppose is better than nothing but is nothing like the royal cabana we had last year which of course was amazing .unfortunatly I don't know if it's new policies been brought in but as a returning guest I certainly do not feel  appreciated .  I love this hotel and have always believed this hotel is about the client unfortunately not this time this will be my last time at the burj for the reasons above .
What I can say is staff at the burj are amazing the hotel is spotless and the spa is fantastic and is the most iconic building in Dubai ","4","2017-09"
"Lunch at Scape","We booked a lunch at Scape Restaurant for 5th September. 
Arrived via golf buggy from JBH and we were taken straight to the restaurant which is on the terrace towards the back of the hotel. Whilst the restaurant itself didn't have any particular wow factor, our waitress Mercy (apologies if spelt wrong) was an absolute credit to your hotel. She was attentive and friendly and made sure we were really well looked after. The food was delicious and we enjoyed a 3 course meal. 
After lunch she even gave us a tour of the new pool area and a peek inside the cabanas that can be hired - just wonderful. 
We did go inside the hotel and have a look round whilst we had the opportunity and the lobby is spectacular.
Thank you for a wonderful few hours.","5","2017-09"
"Wo w ","It was a family tour and the place was wonderful
Love to visit again ,beach was wonderful  ,it was a wonderful evening,on the way seen some amazing hitels ,palm island is the best manmade island ,the best place","5","2017-08"
"Wow!","First impression is a big WoW! The lobby is huge and was the first time I came in one with scalators. The fountain is beautiful, the flowers arragement impresive and the service...the best. The suite was two floors suite, very ornamented and with beautifull views to the Jumeirah complex. All the details are very well studied and housekeeping does a great job, I had the opportunity to meet Angeliki Karampali and Valentina Lombardi, they made our stay memorable. My baby will never forget them! Many thanks ladies for your dedication!
For sure we will enjoy again the hotel/facilities!","5","2017-09"
"Still the Best!","My second stay at the fabulous Burj.

Last time i was here they had not built the new pool area out the back, i must say this is a really brilliant addition to an almost perfect hotel.

This was possibly one of the only problems before as the pool was very small and basic, now you have a fantastic new eating area, decking, salt water pool and infinity pool looking out over the Persian Gulf, (sorry my wife is Persian so we still refer to this as the Persian Gulf and not the UAE shortened version of the Gulf!).

This hotel really speaks for itself with its over the top decor, anything you need service and amazingly large and comfortable rooms.

Very pricey of course but if you can afford it then its an experience you really shouldn't miss in Dubai.

We were travelling with a baby and teenager this time and the only thing i would say is its not really geared up for this. The bars and main restaurants do not cater for children of this age after a certain time, rightly so of course, but you cant really experience everything.","5","2017-05"
"Afternoon tea heaven","The fact that you have to pass through security to even access the hotel grounds sets the tone for your visit.

We chose to visit for afternoon tea figuring it would be one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Without exception, the staff are incredibly professional and when appropriate humourous. The tea itself was truly delicious and there are nice touches such as the cake and sandwich stands being shaped to resemble sails.

We paid the extra 100AED for a window seat and although the day was hazy, were still able to see Burj al Khalifa and the city (the views on the other side are towards the Palm).","5","2017-09"
"Pricey but worth every penny!","Now £300 for afternoon tea for two is not cheap however in my opinion it is worth every penny! We requested a window seat and it would be a shame to go here and not do that (it does cost £20 extra though per table- included above). The view is incredible and we also felt that the view and tea was better than the burj Khalifa due to the mist/ haze. Having afternoon tea allows you access to the hotel (unless you are staying then you can't just go in without a reservation) and the hotel is an experience itself! The decor is breathtaking! So the afternoon tea included a glass of champagne and then unlimited non-alcoholic drinks: the selection was huge! The menu consisted of 7 courses included unlimited sandwiches! The food was incredible, the service amazing and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable and once in a lifetime! If you can do afternoon tea then do it, you won't regret it!","5","2017-09"
"a different level of hospitality","the difference is felt as soon as you turn for the Burj , from the concierge to the elevator and during the stay you feel wanted and welcomed.
do visit the 27th Floor , suggest to book your table for the sunset . its mesmerizing","5","2017-09"
"Like nothing else before...","We visited this as a family of 4, including 2 daughters (4 -7). Since the second we entered the area of BAA we received personalized greetings. We were amazed that the knew our name already at the lobby, when leaving the car at valet. The hotel staff followed guided us to our room that was ready earlier then expected. The informed us of all the attractions and all the complimentary gifts that was there for the whole families enjoyment.

I was surprised of the level of details and friendliness during the whole stay. Sure it is an expensive hotel, but I can say that it is worth the price for that life time experience. It is amazing to experience this in a hotel, like none I ever have experience before!","5","2017-09"
"Best hotel in the world","This is the second time I have stayed at The Burj, this time they had extended at the rear and installed 2 swimming pools, bars, restaurant and cabanas.
All I can say is Wow, this place is out of this world not only the facilities but also the unbelievable service from every staff member.
The restaurants are amazing, the new bar on floor 27 is called Gold and has fantastic cocktails, the view from here is stunning.
You are constantly asked when walking outside towards the pool for your suite number but this is to make sure you are a hotel guest as they do let guests not staying at the hotel for afternoon tea and drinks etc but they restrict them to these ares which I do think is good.
The suites are outstanding and very large with a private butler on each floor.
If you ever get chance this hotel is a must.","5","2017-09"
"Second Wow Experience ","What a delight it was to have retuned to this wonderful hotel. Such a wonderful experience. 

Thank you Ashraf for the coffee. 

Thanks you the entire team and especially to Hotel Manager, Mr. Murray for his exceptional hospitality.  

Service to perfection. I will be back. ","5","2017-09"
"Luxury redefined ","This was our second stay at this luxury hotel. Our suite was a 2 bedroom duplex apartment. The minute you reach the hotel entrance, the staff meet you at the car and greet you by name... They take care of your luggage which arrives at your room before you do. The check in process is done in your suite and you are given a personal butler.

The interiors are mostly Versace designed or inspired. There's a huge dining area and lounging areas. Any visitors have to be listed to be allowed access to the hotel itself. The breakfast is a magnificent experience and has a varieties of cuisines represented. The restaurants are plenty and each are experiences in itself.  

The toiletries provided are truly royal...large Hermes bottles of colognes, perfumes, creams and shower gels.... If you so wish, they will prepare your thumb for a good hot soak with salts and the works. Each bedroom also has a nice walk in wardrobe and space is ample. 

The views are wonderful on all sides....the service is impeccable and they make you feel like a king.... if you want to go out for a drive, you can select a Rolls or a BMW 750 to go around in style.  

In fact during my previous stay here, which was a celebration of my daughters 18th birthday they did a great job decorating the place and giving her a thorough surprise.

It is definitely one of the best hotels in the world ","5","2017-02"
"Luxury choice","I would like to share my experience with travelers and guests around the world. Dubai is the amazing place must visit if you have time and money. Try to stay always good like five star hotels they not expensive but comfortable stay,","5","2017-08"
"I would recommand the afternoon tea...","I would recommend the afternoon tea as it was very well ran, the food excellent as the service and the surroundings but I also think this is a good way to see how the place is and make up your mind if you plan to later stay in the hotel as you can have a look around the lobby and around the swimming pool /bar area/outside restaurant. As far as I could have experienced it just for the afternoon tea I would like to try it for a week-end because in another end it does not feel like a place where you'd stay more.","5","2017-09"
"Nathan outlaw restaurant","This restaurant is in the aquarium. That alone makes it amazing. It is tiny though when you eventually think about it.
But the service is impeccable. These people are going for ten stars.
And then comes the food. We had the tasting menu and believe me that was the best lobster risotto I have had in a looong time. Love it. 
Only downside, it is quite pricey","5","2017-06"
"Not what you expect from “The worlds most luxurious hotel”","The problems started before we arrived with a number of emails not being acknowledged or replied to. There was no pre-arrival email received which seems to be normal practice for most other luxury hotels these days.

We arrived at the hotel at around 12:30 and the car drop off area was very busy and chaotic. We were greeted by the lovely Natasa who escorted us inside and explained that our room was not ready as the hotel had been full the previous evening due to Eide. She asked what we would like to do until 3pm and I suggested we go and relax by the pool.  I explained our swimming clothes were in our suitcases so they were retrieved and we embarrassingly searched through them at the side of the lobby looking for our swim suits and sunscreen etc. (it would have been much nicer to be offered to do this in a private room).

Natasa then escorted us to the beautiful new pool terrace and to the very plush changing rooms and we got our selves ready for the afternoon. The new pool area is stunning and the new infinity pool is spectacular. The sun beds were very comfortable and the bottled water and cold towels provided in cool bags was a nice touch. I didn’t really care for the sand floor as it just makes a mess but I could live with that J The pool was a refreshing but comfortable temperature and was never too crowded. The pool guys were all very helpful and friendly.

At around 2:30 I got a call from Natasa to say our suite was now ready. She came back to the pool to escort us to our 2 bedroom deluxe suite on the 16th floor. The room was spectacular as expected and very spacious for the 4 of us. The head butler for the floor introduced himself and I completed the check in formalities (I found it strange my address details etc were not pre-populated from my reservation). He then showed us around the suite and explained how everything worked although it was all a bit too much to absorb in the time allowed. He showed us the TV remotes which could be used to operate the curtains and also call the butler (more on that later!)

We unpacked our things and headed to the spa to check out the infinity pools up there which have great views of Jumeirah beach and the other hotels in the group which are located there. The spa is beautiful and we enjoyed an hour or so in the pool and hot tub.

After that we went back to the room. The butler asked me what time I would like my birthday cake to be delivered which I found to be a bit strange – so much for the surprise! I asked about the in suite cocktails and was abruptly told they would be served in due course. At around 6pm the cake was delivered with some fruit tarts. We asked about the in suite cocktails and were told there was whiskey, gin plus another spirit which I forget and tonic water. My sister asked if she could have a whiskey and coke and was abruptly told “no we just have tonic”. She also asked if she could have a non-alcoholic drink instead and was told “yes you can have tonic” – so much for the cocktails!!!!

After that we went for dinner in Bab Al Yam. The décor in there doesn’t seem in keeping with the rest of the hotel and it is very simple and basic. The buffet was ok but quite small and limited compared to buffets we have enjoyed in the other Jumeirah hotels. We were sat next to the chicken/steak grill station and it was very hot and unpleasant – overall the restaurant felt very cramped. The staff were very nice but the food was very average and certainly not worth the price paid. We decided to try elsewhere for breakfast the next day.

After dinner we got a friendly buggy driver to take us over to the Al Qsar where we saw what a proper buffet should look like. We had drinks there and rode an Abra before returning to the Burj (once the guy on security eventually allowed the buggy to pass the checkpoint!

As seemed to be the norm there was nobody on the butler desk when we arrived back and we retired to bed for the evening.

Next morning I wanted to speak to the butler to confirm that he would give us a tour of some of the restaurants which was offered the previous day. I pressed the butler button on the remote as instructed the previous day but after 30 minutes nobody had arrived. I tried phoning from several phones but nobody answered. I went out to see if anyone was at the desk but they were not. Eventually very frustrated I gave up. So much for the 24 hour butler service!

We went to breakfast (passing an unattended butler desk) and had a wonderful meal – the décor is beautiful and the staff are outstanding as was the food. After a lovely breakfast we returned to our floor to find an empty butler desk once again. We therefore decided to give up on the previously offered tour.

At around 10:45 we went to checkout and fortunately the butler was actually there this time! Checkout took almost 30 minutes for no apparent reason. They had not included the charges for our Royal Cabana which I asked to be added on – this seemed to cause a problem for some reason. I passed on the info regarding lack of butler service and the butler on the desk said he would pass on my feedback to his manager. He also told us the butler call buttons didn’t work (it would have been helpful to know that yesterday!)

Natasa appeared as if by magic and escorted us down to our Royal Cabana for the day. The Cabanas are great – especially the end ones which we had which had beautiful views of the ocean to the back and side and a wrap around balcony. There was also a very nice private bathroom.  A large fruit bowl was provided and a complimentary mini bar stocked with soft drinks and cold towels. It was so nice to have a cool place to chill next to the pool.

A couple of hours later the butler’s manager appeared and I explained the issues we had experienced. He said the phone was supposed to divert after 3 rings so obviously there was a technical problem. He asked if there was anything he could do to make up for it but I said I wasn’t after any freebies – I was just disappointed that it had affected our stay. He was very polite and apologetic though which somewhat made up for the lack of service previously.

A little while later a large ice bucket appeared with a bottle of champagne and sparkling grape juice which was a nice touch.

We enjoyed the rest of the day in and around the cabana and were treated to ice lollies and Japanese ice-cream periodically throughout the day. We stayed until around 6pm after which we showered and dressed for dinner. We went to the front desk to leave our day bags whilst we went for dinner. A very rude lady in one of the gold shell shaped desk told me “I was at the wrong side – go over there” (I’m not sure how you are supposed to know which is the bell desk and which is the Concierge desk as they are not marked in any way I could see). I then asked the bell desk if we could store our bags and this seemed to be a difficult request for some reason but eventually he took them). We caught a buggy went for a much more pleasant and enjoyable buffet at the Al Qsar J

We returned to the Burj to get our luggage and leave. The staff outside were very unhelpful in assisting us to get a taxi to take us to the airport and we stood in the heat confused whilst everyone ignored us. Eventually a taxi arrived and off we went.

Overall it was a very disappointing experience. We would return to rent a cabana as a non-resident to enjoy the wonderful terrace but certainly not to stay overnight. The overall service was certainly not what you would expect from “The world’s most luxurious hotel” – the staff should be sent to the Waldorf Astoria on the Palm to learn how to treat guests with courtesy and respect.","3","2017-09"
"A Taste Of What It's Like to Be A Royal","We had a fantastic time. The service was absolutely incredible! We booked a two bedroom suite and everything was perfect.  As we drove in, the front gate must have radioed ahead because we were greeted by a receiving line. After being handed cold wash clothes and drinks from the first two people, the third person in line led us directly to our incredible suite and we were given a tour while our butler took our passports and processed our check in. Champagne, fruit, Panna  waters and pastries were delivered to our room. They provided both unpacking and repacking luggage service which my 19 and 21 year old kids were very excited about. The butlers arranged anything we wanted at any moment in time. Cars we ordered to go into town pulled up as we walked out of the building so there was never a wait. We ordered room service from a varied and incredible menu and it was set up in the dining room formally and beautifully and cleaned up after efficiently. Although the temperature was very hot in August, the pool was kept cooler then the 107 Degree F air, so It was like a refreshing bathtub temperature. Additionally, since the property is on a man made island in the golf, there was a pleasant breeze coming off the water so it was enjoyable to be outside despite the heat. The restaurants were great and varied. The photos on Trip Advisor accurately depict the rooms. They are all in great condition and have beautiful views.","5","2017-08"
"fantastic luxury hotel","This hotel is more of an experience than a hotel, the suites are lavish the staff very attentive the butlers are great. During our stay my wife had a sore throat she mentioned this during breakfast to our waiter less than 2 minutes later the manager came over to check on her and then organised a honey drink which did help they even made up a parcel so she could have the same drink in the afternoon, its service like this that turns a good hotel into a great hotel. If you have the chance treat yourself .","5","2017-08"
"A Different World...","From start to finish, everyone from Doormen, Concierge, Butlers, Housekeeping, Chefs, Waiting Staff, Poolside Staff, 'behind the scenes' teams - no words to describe the experiences the Burj Al Arab offers and the 'above and beyond' services that await your every need.
We are regular visitors and upon arrival, we still pinch ourselves and count down the days (quite literally) until we are there again!","5","2017-07"
"Excellent","had visited with my husband and my toddler but unfortunately my toddler had fallen I'll but the staff was amazing they took excellent care the butlers had sent in a personal hand written get well soon card along with a teddybear  for my son they even had paramedics come visit him they also provided soups for my son which was not charged for.All in all I have to say it is one of the best luxury hotel in dubai by far hands down hospatilaty at it's best I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone whose looking for a great hotel and great service price is a little steep but if you look at the services provided it is totally worth it ,candies for kids, beautiful view ,Hermes toiletries 24 hrs butler service and the list goes on .My special thanks to Miss Ronnie from the butler service .","5","2017-09"
"One of the world's great hotel experiences","Quite simply, Burj Al Arab is one of the world's best hotels and some would argue the best. Words do not do it justice. It is quite stunning and superb. Certainly the most memorable hotel experience I have ever enjoyed. The building of course is unique in terms of its architecture - an other worldly design. The internal fittings are almost equally amazing. Suites are grandly furnished and huge. The staff are there to make sure your every need is met. Multiple outstanding dining options are available or in room dining is nearly as good. Food is the very best quality. Three gorgeous pools, one with its own beach area, with luxury cabanas for rent. Yes it's expensive but it is an experience you will never forget, long after the credit card is paid off. If you can possibly stay here at least once in your life, you will remember it forever. Look out on bookings.com for specials and take advantage of them. We did!","5","2017-09"
"Panoramic One Bedroom Suite","The Burj Al Arab has an excellent reputation and it is certainly well-deserved. There is literally gold everywhere. Is it over the top? Yes. Do you pay for it? Yes. Do the staff make it worth it? Thankfully, yes. Though it is a bit away from the city metro, there are many options for transport. I was able to book a hotel car within minutes of my call to the butler. Don't want to pay for the car? They'll get you a taxi. The staff are mainly foreign, from many different countries, easy to find someone that can speak with you. In my experience, everyone spoke excellent English. My only minor complaint would be the mini bars. For the price you pay for the room, it should be free, at least for the non-alcoholic stuff. The facilities were awesome. The terrace was well-maintained, the spa was good, and the restaurants were great. Like many have said, this place is not cheap, but if you want a luxury experience, you will get your money's worth.","5","2017-08"
"7⭐️ understatement ","This hotel has never and will never be an ordinary place. It's a fantasy that became true once you entered the lobby. The treatment, the greeting and the ambience, A feeling you'll never forget nor experience any where else. At least for now. I have stayed in more than 70 hotels,and in  castles as an honorary guest in 4 different countries and trust me when I say, Burj Al Arab is in a whole different class of its own.
From the moment the chauffeur greets you until you settle in your apartment (suite) , a wonder on its own . 
This is my 2nd stay and my 6th visit and nothing has changed in terms of service, punctuality by staff, appearance, and taste. Nothing will make you understand and know what I'm talking about, unless you experience what I have had the pleasure of having.

A special thank you to the wonderful and Amazing staff of Talise spa for their Amazing treatment and their generosity for a wonderful gift that we'll always hold dear in our hearts.

""Burj Al Arab"" you have set a new standard in  hospitality that's truly difficult to follow.

Thank you for making our 10th Anniversary a magical time.

"Mindblowing Experience ","I visited the Burj Al Arab for breakfast at the beautiful Sahn Eddar lounge which had incredible views of the famous golden pillars with a view up to the top of the Burj. I have been to some of the worlds most amazing hotels but this has to be number 1 in terms of sheer opulence and luxury. The building itself is just mesmerising and overwhelming, like something from a dream. The level of service was on another level also, my waitress Lota was incredibly warm and welcoming and engaged in lovely conversation with me talking about the hotel and Dubai she was so attentive and the food I had was just amazing. There were fresh fruits, toasts with beautiful jams, a lovely continental breakfast and fresh fruit juice. The food itself was amazing but coupled with the view of the beach and the amazing interior of the hotel was like something I have never experienced. 

The waitress then got the restaurant manager Gosia to give me a very special and unexpected private tour of the hotel. I was taken in the special private glass elevator which goes up the side of the building all the way to the top to admire the views. I was then taken to the terrace with the pool and given a tour of one of the restaurants. 

This special touch and tour was so unexpected and not something I have ever experienced in another hotel. It was just unforgettable and amazing. 

I really want to praise the manager and all the staff for the incredible level of service and for giving me this once in a lifetime opportunity. 

Thank you. ","5","2017-09"
"Luxury tower hotel","This ship-shaped luxury hotel is being claimed as an 8-star hotel according to our guide. The reason being some gold plated interiors and the helipad at the top. An unique architectural beauty right on the beach.","4","2017-05"
"Amazing Stay at the Burj al Arab","Anything you could dream - will be fullfilled in the Burj al Arab.
Breakfast was in high Quality, the pool area is amazing. The rooms are breathtaking.
If you have any Chance to stay there  - just do it.","5","2017-08"
"Heaven in the sky","It may be expensive but worth every penny. Staying a couple of days to celebrate a special event only brings the whole event to the highest level.  Something to remember and cherish. Worth the expense in every way.","5","2017-08"
"They've thought of nearly everything","If you can get over the fact that you're essentially staying in a tourist attraction, it's nigh on impossible not to be impressed by the decor, facilities or amenities at Burj Al Arab.  Tourists taking photos as they arrive for afternoon tea are somewhat of a health and safety hazard, especially at weekends.

 If the Burj hasn't got it, it's probably not worth having in a hotel room. Too long to list but if you think of everything, and I mean everything, you've ever had in a hotel room, I guarantee it will be in your suite... plus the mac, printer, Hermès full-sized toiletries and complimentary sail-shaped baklava. What else would you expect from a 7-star hotel?

If you're super picky you might struggle to find somewhere to plug in your iPhone or mac charger because the sockets are all so low to the floor and work surfaces. In addition, there is only one aux input for your iPhone/iPod which means you have to hear the same thing all over the suite although bedrooms and bathrooms do have their own volume control. Bluetooth would be better, as would more aux ports.  And if you're a bit of an eco-warrior you'd probably prefer organic skin and haircare products to the highly perfumed shampoos and conditioners.

The terrace cabanas really are worth it if you want a little privacy around the pool, an air-conditioned room to chill out in, well-stocked mini bar and private balcony to the rear.

Team Burj - the Terrace reception staff, pool team and the floor butlers here are second to none - can't do enough for you. Be sure to get your butler to show you everything in the the room - it took us over a day to find the coffee machine and three days to find the beach bags. Cherryl deserves a special mention - she was simply wonderful - super smart and gracious at the same time - winning combination; as was the manager who couldn't do enough for us towards the end of our stay.

There were slight technical issues with the restaurants while we were here - kitchen equipment not fully working in Scape on Day 1 and Bab Al Yam closed on Day 3, but these were minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things.

We came to the Burj as part of a special occasion and whilst not everything was perfect, the management promptly dealt with our feedback and did everything possible to address the situation.

If you like the finer things in life and are a fan of everything Dubai stands for then you will love this place.","5","2017-08"
"Unique :-)","Upon arrival we had the greeting in main entrance which was nice, and then straight to the suite for check in (also in suite check out)... And what a suite.... Wowww!! On the 24rth floor with view to the terrace and jumeirah beach,left us speechless! Butler right outside our door,always ready to make us happy:-) Huge bathroom with hermes amenities even parfume for both of us (body lotion was missing but after our request the brought one),and great bed to sleep on it for hours! The only thing that didnt work properly was the ipad that is used to control the room and a thing with cleaning service ( they left 2 used glasses in our bedroom for up to 24 hours and also a plate of food ). Buffet at junsui rest is the best asian buffet we have ever eat,just amazing! Breakfast its ok, nothing special and the pools and cabanas at the terrace are perfect especialy if u visit burz at summer the cabana is necessary due the hight level of heat..Summersalt beach club is super with white sand and worm sea water,the only downthing is that u have to wait for a buggy to stroll around and that can take up some time waiting (even 15 minutes during rush hour).Overall its a life time experience to stay to this hotel ,that everyone must try :-)","4","2017-08"
"Over the Top!!- in a good way","We stayed here back in 2009 and it was awesome, the two story suits are over the top, I still remember the decadent bathrooms, the superp service from check in until check out and the lavish breakfast buffet. Once in a life time visit :)","5","2016-09"
"Afternoon Tea","We have just got back to our room at Al Naseem after a beautiful afternoon tea.
It was made more special by the managers Marianette and Gosia and the wonderfull Berna who looked after us.
We travel a lot and when you find people that are genuine and take time to ensure you have the best experience it is really appreciated. 
Please pass on our thanks and appreciation to them again for us.

"Another great stay","We stayed here for the 4th time...Had a great summerpackage offer. It included a lot of extra's, as a massage, transportation, dinner in their Junsui restaurant and a cabana for a day. This was only for a short stopover this time unfortunately. Love the atmosphere...the suites are great and their new pool is so amazing! Loved it! Had a lovely breakfast in our suite. We very much appreciated the drink and canape's in the suite in the evening as well the candy train for our daughter! What a nice touch! Only 'negative' thing as you can call it negative, the constant attention from everybody..from butler to pool boys, they all want to make and feel you comfortable but sometimes all the attention can be bothering......But we will be back for sure for another stay! Look forward to it!","5","2017-08"
"Incomparable","From the moment you book to the moment you leave, the staff at Burj Al Arab make you feel like a superstar. They're clearly well trained, empowered, and willing to help and, in a city rammed with five-star beach hotels, this is what makes the difference, and this is why we go back. 
Tips for families: the one-bedroom suite is plenty big enough for a family of four (maybe even 5): you sleep upstairs on a King bed while it's easy to fit a single bed in downstairs, even when the sofa is converted to a double sofa bed.
The new Terrace (pool area) is absolutely gorgeous. It has a little mini beach area, and pool boys who come around with ice lollies and popcorn. 
I simply can't fault this hotel.","5","2017-08"
"Lovely hotel ","My mom was stayed at Buj Al Arab for 5 days it was January. I come in dubai for 17 days she highly recommend me to BUJ Al Arab lovely hotel wonderful views.
What a beauty inside outside. Size of room is perfect wonderful decore nice pool closer to Beach nice Bar .....
Everything was very amazing 
I have book only for 3 days....
I will definitely come back with more days....","5","2017-08"
"Top favourite ","Hello this is Anne we come very often in Dubai but I never had a trip in Burj al arab before I have nothing to say about that everyone knows when you go more than5* hotel this is like one of the 7* hotel what's a view very expensive decorator everything looks amazing we was fell lovely not a lovely more than that

"6 stars","My husband and stayed at Burj Al Arab for a couple of days in July. The common areas, suites and spa are just gorgeous in a very unique way, and the service was excellent. It was our wedding anniversary and we were treated to a beautiful cake and tamarind drink. Our overall experience was great, but I have to say the highlight of our stay was our time at the spa (if you can, I highly recommend visiting their indoor pools which are beautiful). ","5","2017-07"
"Summer holiday in Dubai","Fantastic family holiday, we enjoyed unparalleled luxury, excellent friendly service, fine cuisine and beautiful surroundings.  We have been to many wonderful places in the world whenever we discuss future holidays and where to go, this hotel is always the number one choice.  Looking forward to returning next year!","5","2017-08"
"Elvis and Liberace hooked up to create this experience...","Tacky, tacky fun at a very dear price.  I think all the rooms are suites.  We had a huge 2 story place looking over the sea.  It was done in golds and mirrors and eye popping blues and reds.  It just screams nouveau riche.   Fun for a laugh but not a serious hotel in any way, just tacky fun.  Oh, and the food is just so-so for big bucks.  

If you have a quick stop over in Dubai and want a laugh, stay at the Burj al Arab.  If you want a nice, practical place, try the Shangri-La.  ","4","2017-03"
"Not the first review of this property","I can't extol the virtues of this property enough and I have already reviewed it more than once. I love staying here. I can't count how many times I've stayed and every time, it exceeds expectations. It really is a remarkable hotel with the best customer service that I've ever experienced. 
We had a number of unfortunate experiences that came up on this trip and the hotel outdid themselves to resolve them. The first thing that happened is that my shower door inexplicably exploded on the first night, fortunately when we were out having dinner. The hotel handled it very efficiently and professionally and immediately provided me with assistance in moving to another room (of equal standard) and also gave me a wonderful gift basket of products for the inconvenience and deducted the cost of the room for one night of the four nights I stayed (at my request). 
The other way in which they were outstanding is that my daughter accidentally left her handbag/purse in a taxi that had delivered us to the hotel. Not only did they track down the taxi (using the hotel camera surveillance), they kept us fully updated on the taxi's movements and recovered the purse and all it's contents.
Aside from those, beyond the norm experiences, I would highly recommend this hotel for the fact that the rooms are clean and spacious and if you book and ocean view room it's wonderful to watch the sunset in the evenings from the balcony. There are several hotel pools to choose from, a myriad of restaurants to go to (most with exceptional food and service) and the most amazing breakfast buffet that I've ever encountered. To get about there are golf buggies to take you from one resort in the group to the other or the free water taxi (abra). The added extras - a free bus to the Dubai Mall, a Wild Wadi pass (a water park next to the hotel) are just an added bonus.
Would I recommend this hotel to friends, yes and I already have!","5","2017-07"
"Posh hotel with some problems with service","I wanted to visit the world's only 7 star hotel to understand is it really worth of all the money you have to pay to stay there. The overall experience was excellent with some dissatisfaction to the service.

The interior of the hotel is very spacious and very nicely decorated. Despite many other reviewers have complained that visitors are flocking the public areas, I did not see much of that. There indeed were some visitors, but that was not a problem.

The suite itself is huge in two floors. Both floors have a glass wall that gives excellent views either to Burj Khalifa or to Atlantis the Palm. There is a big bathroom upstairs with a yacuzzi and a toilet downstairs called ""powder room"". When checking in there is a complimentary bowl of fruits and box of dates waiting. Also, they provide a bottle of date drink to sip. Later on they provided some snacks.

As a hotel guest you are allowed to get to the sky bar without a reservation, and you can also have high afternoon tea without prebooking. The cocktail prices in the bar range from 30 euros to 1600 euros! The breakfast is excellent and there is a lot of variety in the available dishes.

The restaurants in the hotel are quite expensive but they provide a complimentary golf cart shuttle to the nearby Madinat Souq where the price level is more reasonable.

After checking out you can leave the luggage at the luggage room and  hang out at the pool, or at the private beach nearby. At the pool they provide complimentary water and some ice cream (I got two different servings during the afternoon).

Despite of the favorable aspects of the hotel ,there are a couple of issues the hotel management should attend. While I was still considering whether I stay there I contacted the hotel many times by email and requested more information about various topics, but I did not get any response - not even when asking again. Finally I escalate the issue to the general manager, and suddenly I got an answer! In the reply they claimed that they are switching to another email system, and did not get (or see) all emails. Funny enough, they got my emails right after I contacted the general manager...

When leaving the hotel I requested a metered taxi, and the valet parking staff pointed me to a Lexus, which they said is a metered taxi even if it does not have the usual taxi sign on the top. It turned out to be special shuttle service available only to the hotel customers and it did cost a lot more than a standard taxi. I am sure they knew that the taxi was not a metered one and gave an outright lie with a straight face!","5","2017-08"
"Iconic legend!!!","From the minute our car crossed the bridge to arrive at the famous BAA we were treated like royalty. Everything in this hotel is meant to make guests feel at home away from home. Nothing is impossible when you are a guest. Our two levels panoramic suite offering 180 degree views overlooking the ever-changing panorama of Dubai and the Arabian Gulf was impeccably designed with an opulent colour scheme, sumptuous furnishings and exclusive amenities. The butler service was something to really praise about, Justyna did her best to fulfill all our needs and was always asking if we neeeded anything else. After 10 years coming to Dubai every year I can say with no doubt: BAA IS THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD!!!!","5","2017-08"
"LUXURY LUXURY LUXURY","we had my friends birthday there an the food was incredible. The service was amazing and the food to die for. We ate at the French restaurant which is right at the top of the building in that odd shape off the side. We took a little self guided tour at the end of it and they have thought of every little detail. It is well worth even going there for a look. Which I think you have to book. 
Only issue was that I did order my friend a surprise birthday cake, which they emailed her the confirmation so the surprise was ruined which considering the price I was paying for the cake and the fact that it was a 7 star property, I didn't think they would make an error like that. It didn't ruin the other amazing experience though. Recommend it.","5","2017-07"
"Over the top but worth it","My family and I recently spent three nights at the self proclaimed most luxurious hotel of the world.  

The service was impeccable. The food in three of four restaurants we visited was really excellent. We just thought the western style breakfast was just ok. 

We stayed in a two bedroom suite. Huge and with everything you could want. The decoration is extravagant. It's like Lawrence of Arabia meets Las Vegas. Even the coffee maker was gold. 

The bathroom for the main bedroom is larger than a room at a typical luxury hotel, and as advertised, the amenities are all generous. They even put a woman's and man's full size perfume/ cologne bottles for you to use. 

Our bottler was extremely attentive and did take care of everything. Restaurant reservations, transportation, dry cleaning, etcz. 

Expensive yes. Worth it, definitely. ","5","2017-08"
"Dubais' Best Views from their Greatest Hotel","There is a lot of hype around this hotel, and even from arrival you can see why... everything from the drive leading up to the hotel, through to the lobby with its' dancing fountains and massive aquariums, and the concierge per floor makes this hotel stand out.

A friend of mine booked one of the Presidential Suites for us, and I must say the room is grand! Spread over two floors and massive in size, it is truly something to behold. The Hermes products in the bathrooms were also a big plus.

The only thing that was a bit of a let down was that one of the bedside lights in my room didn't work, and one of the bedside phones in my room didn't dial out to room service etc. Their Burj Al Arab Breakfast from the room service menu also wasn't particularly amazing, although I did order a Wagu steak from room service one night and it was delicious! 

Overall I did love our stay there, but the small bits that weren't working and the breakfast was a bit of a let down as I expected more from the worlds 7* hotel. Too high expectations perhaps, but I would still definitely recommend this place to anyone who asks.","4","2017-04"
"Sheer Luxury.","My wife and I stayed at the Burj for 3 days on the way back from the Banyan Tree in the Maldives.
Luxury is an understatement, from being picked up from the airport, to being met at the Hotel by 4 members of staff (Including your personal butler) who offer you cold towels, chocolates , dates and a cold drink.
The foyer is amazing with fountains including one that shoots a spout many feet into the air and smaller ones that seem to dance and follow each other as well as waterfalls and a fish tank built into the wall all the way up  the escalator. There is gold leaf everywhere and it is full of bright colours. The atrium seems to go right to the top of the hotel.
Our butler took us to our suite, (yes two floors, living/dining room plus office down stairs and bedroom & bathroom upstairs) where he booked us in and showed us around.
Rooms.
The living room is vast with full length windows large settees & chairs large built in TV, coffee table with boxes of dates and chocolates, fresh cut flowers everywhere and you have a remote control that works everything. The decor is lavish with fabrics in blue and gold leaf on most of the fittings (see photos).
Dining Area.
There is a round solid dining table decorated with fresh fruit, there was a complimentary bottle of wine with glasses waiting for us, there is a fully stocked mini bar as well as a wine cooler.
Office Area.
There is an office desk complete with stationary pens, a laptop computer and printer and phone (there are phones everywhere)
There is a large walk in room for clothes and luggage and a winding staircase up to the bedroom and bathroom.
Bedroom.
The room is dominated by the large King size bed, you get a pillow menu and this must be one of the most comfortuble beds I have slept in. There are 2 easy chairs with foot stool and a settee and table, there is also a dressing table with draws and cupboards with a TV on top. On the ceiling above the bed is a large mirror ( I presume this is so you can comb your hair before you get up in the morning. lol).
Bathroom.
Where to start. There is gold leaf on all the metal fittings there is a duel vanity top with every kind of toiletries you may need including full size perfumes & aftershave by Hermes. On our second day we asked our butler if we could take the toiletries home and he said “of course we could”. We packed them in our suitcase that evening as we were leaving the next day and went to dinner, when we got back he had replaced everything, we didn’t have the cheek to take these when we left. 
There is a large walk-in shower with nozzles pointing everywhere with a large rain shower head above. There is a large oval hydro bath and a rack full of soft towels of all sizes.
There are numerous restaurants at the Burj and our only negative on our visit (and this is personal taste) is the service, don’t get me wrong it is exceptional but for us a bit over the top e.g. if you have a sip of wine there is someone there immediately to top up your glass, if you put your napkin down someone will fold it. I imagine most of the guests expect this but we like to be left alone when dining.
All the staff we met during our stay were very friendly and made you feel very welcome especially our butler who has a desk just outside your room.
All in all this was a totally luxurious end to our holiday.","5","2016-09"
"Ladies Tea","excellent afternoon tea for a proper ladies day out! it is a bit pricey but definitely worth it to see one of the most famous landmarks in the world.

Note: you must book to be allowed entry to the hotel!","5","2017-03"
"YH","Going with the wind 
I am an old customer of the hotel , I have been coming since 2002 and I really did enjoy it a lot however on my recent visit I have noticed changes to the worse and unfortunately the hotel is heading to become a very fancy Holiday inn .
It is actually a very sad story as this hotel is an icon for the whole Arab world .
I have come to know many of the managers in the hotel including Mr Luc de La Fus , Mr H Morio , Mr Mahmoud Sakr etc whom all of them met with and my family and we were very well acquainted .
First of all , I have already checked in the hotel few days ago and could not get through the gate , I am very familiar with procedure . That day was my first day of my arrival as my son was already in the room a couple of days before my arrival .
After I managed to get through the gate I reached the front of the hotel and could NOT see anybody ! No body to receive me , no body to carry my bags to the room 
Around 4.30 in the morning I had a call from my butler that I have to pay some money ? This has happened on a daily basis by the way knowing fully well I used to stay in hotel for a month at a time in the three bedroom suite .
Rooms are not cleaned properly as they should and as it used to be in the past , I took an iron board out to iron my shirts when I came back the iron board was still there !!!
J S the Chinese restaurant has become the worst place in the hotel with the quality of the food at its worst , the restaurant is very busy with mainly Chinese who with my due respect have no respect or regard to anybody . The food is horrible unfortunately .
They are bothering people non stop with taking photos which I really don't like specially when we are with the family .
Bab Al Yam is a market place you can't have your breakfast in peace , it is so roudy and again the food and service has changed a lot to the worse .
Al Ewan which is supposed to be Arabic cuisine is furthest from any Arabic cuisine .
Old staff of this hotel are leaving and new faces are coming and they do NOT have any manners or an idea about the caliber of the hotel they are working at .
As I have spoken with many staff most of them are trying to leave and trying to find other jobs in other hotels .
Older staff are the pillar of the hotel and they should be taken care of as they are very familiar with the hotel and its original guests .
I wish the older management would return as it is very obvious that it is a top management problem in the hotel . This hotel is being run like an everyday hotel not like Burj al Arab .
My kids are no more members of the spa .
I am a gold Sirius card holder for many years .
For the sake of this awesome hotel pls save it as it is a real land mark 
Just an example , I was having tea in the lounge and they brought a tray with nuts on it . Pls look at the cashew nuts !!! I have never ever seen them present something like that in the past , this is the caliber of people that they want to employ in the hotel !! Very very sad really .
Dubai has gone a long way and we wish it to fly higher and higher . 
Pls save Burj Al Arab","1",
"Unforgettable!","Once in a lifetime experience. Everything was just perfect. They treated us like a royalty. They gave us a complimentary birthday cake for our daughter. We had a high afternoon tea. It was just amazing!","5","2017-08"
"Arab Opulance","Truly an iconic property with an Arab influence. Everything is catered for and largely anticipipate every need recovèred with Arabic charm.

It is an experience from the arrival to the room without a reception desk","5","2017-08"
"Really magnificent 7 star hotel","The world's only 7 star hotel. Really magnificent golden interiors. Me and friends had a buffet breakfast at Junsui Asian restaurant and was treated very nicely and well-accommodated by the friendly staff. The food and service are really superb. I especially recommend celebrating special occasions and informing the reservations team in advance as well there as they provide complimentary celebration cake. Lovely!","5","2017-07"
"Amazing Experience","Spent 3 nights in a panoramic one bedroom suite- incredible! It was as big as our house, which is a sizeable 4 bedroom. Two levels with expansive bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Great view of Dubai and Arabian Sea from the room also. Amenities were full sized and great to take home.

We had dinner and cocktails on the top floor which was quite an experience. Very expensive but worth doing once. There was also a $1000 cocktail on the menu - it had gold dust in it!

Indoor swimming pool was a little small but ok. We found it amusing that we were watched intently by the on duty lifeguard as we were the only people in the pool and quite competent swimmers.

Whatever you do dont miss visiting the private beach. We were taken there by buggy and then kindly escorted to our seats on the beach where we were offered cold towels, sunscreen, drinks etc etc superb

I have been to many luxury hotels over the years and it takes a lot to impress me but i was definitely very impressed.

Service was great. Always felt very secure and pampered.

You have to visit this place at least once. Mind you i am tempted to return for another visit soon","5","2016-09"
"Best experience ","Burj Al Arab is not just a name but a trustworthy brand.some people says it's expensive but believe me it's worth for life time experience.each and every thing about this hotel is unique but what I like besides luxury is that each staff of this hotel we came across looks very happy working with this company.i want to mention Hari as there ambassador. He was so helpfully. Since it was our first short trip to Dubai (and surprise for my wife ) Hari made sure that we get enough information about city with map and approx price for cab to see attractions.must visit ones and get treated like a king and queen.","5","2017-08"
"Truly is the best hotel in the world","As they say There is no hotel like this in the world. I can officially agree. It is out of this world. It's beautiful in every way possible. We stayed in a 2 bed suite. The ocean view was unreal. Staff make this hotel even more special, only small issue we had was we had to wait for a table for breakfast I thought they would've had more space. But the review still gets 5 out of 5. ","5","2017-08"
"This is my dream hotel","Am coming Dubai lots every year 2 ,3 times I never have visited in Burj Al Arab this is more than 5 star it's should be 7* hotel very wonderful very beautiful nice clean it was my dream hotel to visit when you come you will just enjoy you will have nothing to say about that wonderful views lovely pool......so many I really love this is in the top","5","2017-08"
"Special celebration stay cation ","The Burj al Arab is listed as being one of the ten top hotels in the world. It also possibly the most iconic of them all. So it is of little wonder that having lived in Dubai for seven years. it was the place of choice to celebrate three special events within our family. 
Two special birthdays and a wedding anniversary. 
The hotel did not disappoint in any way. From the point of contact to making the reservation for a two night stay. 
On arrival the experience was overwhelming and the staff looked after our every need and made us feel very special. The hotel, as you would expect is excellent and the facilities are second to none. 
As for the food and beverage, unbelievable with every taste accommodated for. Especially now Nathan Outlaw has opened his new restaurant,  being seafood lovers. 
Many thanks to all who made our stay a memorable one and we can thoroughly recommend your services/hotel to anyone and everyone. 
Thanks again

"Can there be a star higher than 5?","I've lived in Dubai all my life (so far) and the Burj Al Arab is my favourite hotel. 
It is in a really good location (a man-made island about 250ft from shore) as it is a one minute walk from Wild Wadi (a Water Park),restraunts , shops, a gym,  a kids club and a beach(s).
Technically, the Burj al Arab does not have all those things but it is fairly close (2 min walk max). 
When we stayed, they delivered sweets to our room. Our room was sea view and two stories. The facilities are amazing.
It is defently worth the price.","5","2016-09"
"Amazing!","I've had afternoon tea at the Burj and also cocktails, all I can say is outstanding on both occasions. The views are utterly stunning, staff are fantastic and 5 star service all round. Can highly recommend!","5","2017-05"
"more than 5 star!","asolutely out of this world. We went to the beachside restaurant which I would recommend my partner had the Aberdeen angus burger which was so lovely he wouldn't share! then we went to the 27th floor for drinks. the view was breathtaking and I couldn't believe how beautiful the lobby was the level of detail from all of the staff. thank you x","5","2016-09"
"Beautiful good","Visited for an afternoon buffet lunch and was very impressed the food was outstanding, very fresh and delicious. Our waitress also took it upon herself to put my handbag on a table hook for me so my Louis wasn't left on the floor. Top end service","5","2017-08"
"I love the shine ","Been To Burj Al Arab.... many times ... and this Hotel is what they call Different... it's not like any other place , the lighting fountain at the lobby, is lovely.. the sun tiles between the 2 gold pillars is my favorite picture place... my favorite restaurant is Scape restaurant... the staff is lovely and they would do anything to meet a customer need like some time in November 2016, I visited for my traditional wedding simple family dinner and my parents needed rice but they didn't have any rice on the menu but they improvised 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 got them rice ... one of the restaurants I have always returned to, gold on 27 is a good bar too... with nice cocktails 🍹 , I can talk forever about the beauty of Burj Al Arab , but it's better for you to visit and check out this hotel which I call one of its kind . ","5","2017-05"
"Phenomenal stay","Simply the best in every way especially since the upgrade to the pool area. This is another level of service from the moment you arrive. Only limitation is for small kids facilities are off site but this is not a big deal as buggy service is excellent to other Jumeirah resorts and waterpark.","5","2016-08"
"Just Amazing","We stayed to celebrate our anniversary and loved it.

Personalized check-in, amazing suites with an expansive bedroom upstairs, Hermes toiletries, private butler on your floor and spectacular views - what more can you ask for!
There are mixed reviews about the hotel interiors - but I lovvvved the opulence.

We tried the restaurants Al Mahara, Gold on 27, the Skyview Bar, drinks at the new pool area (Terrace) and Junsui – each one was unique and an interesting experience.

It’s the small things that make a difference and BAA does them so well with understated elegance and absolute luxury.

Will definitely return.","5","2017-05"
"I can't believe it's seven stars!!! ","Last week I spent a lot of money on a weekend of relaxation but I received nothing of the kind. 
The second I got to my room ( which was very nice) I was immediately interrupted buy a cleaner and a room service only 10 minutes after. 
Also my jacuzzi was faulty. As I went to switch it on it didn't come on for another half an hour. 
I brought this up with the receptionist and she said she will get someone to deal with it, they never came. 
I then again asked the receptionist and they finally got someone to deal with it. After all of this they then move me to another room which was not the room payed for. I spent the whole night trying to get another room which I had payed a lot of money for but they just ignored. 

I would never recommend this hotel. 
They say it is seven stars, however I would only rate it a 3 at maximum for its service and lack of care for its customers.","3","2017-07"
"Still the best hotel in the world","This is our second stay at the Burj Al Arab, the last being in 2015. Since then, they have added the Terrace and it's taken an amazing hotel to a whole new level. 

The interior design is not to everyone's taste but you cannot fault the attention to detail. 

The entry level Suite is huge, double story with bed and bathroom upstairs and the lounge, bar and dining downstairs. 

We had our 10 year old with us and she slept downstairs on the very best sofa bed I have ever seen. An adult would be perfectly comfortable sleeping on it. 

The room is amazing.

The new Terrace adds spectacular views and swimming pools, with comfortable lounges and seats. It was very hot when we were here but the pools were perfect for keeping the heat at bay. 

Big shout out to Indika in the pool bar who made such an effort to keep us refreshed! 

We had breakfast at both restaurants. Jinsu was Asian style but there were plenty of alternatives and the other at the poolside restaurant was more mainstream. Both were excellent but a special thanks to Eddie who went out of his way to look out for our daughter when she accidentally dropped a plate. He made her smile when she was horribly embarrassed. 

What makes the Burj and what keeps us wanting to come back is the service. Our butlers were all exceptional. Thanks Dip, Esmyt, Raymond and Luis. You really made things easy.

It's the little touches, like fresh fruit, a drink and snack delivered late afternoon, the amenities!!!! They think of everything.
Bathrobes magically appear, even for the small person and nothing is too much hassle. 

As I write a travel blog, I have stayed in some amazing hotels, and many get most things right. The Burj however gets almost everything right, every time.

If you can afford it, a night at the Burj Al Arab is absolutely worth it. We don't like to return to the same place twice, but we will definitely be back here.

There is nowhere better. And if your budget can't stretch this far, book at the sister hotel the Al Naseem and have dinner or drinks here instead.

"Five Glorious Days","Opulent to say the least. Reminded me of the feel of a cruise ship in the dessert but with an amazing pool facility. The hotel is quite different each room has a butler to service your every need. Suites are expansive, 2 story with all Hermes products. Nightly gifts are left on your pillow top. Restaurant options are great. We enjoyed the buffet dining on the ground floor with views of the pool. Chef Gert was a highlight for us, he will prepare special meals if you ask.  We visited the bar a few times, not much action keep in mind it is summer. Lovely decor, amazing views but prices for drinks are absolutely gauging. $50  US for a glass of ok champagne. Upon leaving the doorman suggested we go to the ATM machine to get cash for a cab to airport versus having credit card options available. Of course, hotel will get you to the airport for $150 BMW or RollsRoyce for $600. We spent $50 with tip for a Lexus service. We can afford to spend $$$$ given we spent a lot to stay there, but why?  They are unconcerned with cost over servicing to the point they try to control your needs. If you are from US beware they have no sports options on TV such as British Open was not available. Cannot accept that from such a high service over the top hotel. Again, it is almost mechanical but in their defense they are servicing so many cultures it may be impossible to anticipate Americans needs. ","5","2017-07"
"Wedding Anniversary!!","We had a wonderful wedding anniversary stay here in a two bedroom suite on the 20th floor. Beautiful views of the Arabian Sea and Downtown Dubai! Luxury and opulence at its best! This place was on our bucket list to do and we finally got a chance to check it off the list and it was worth it. All of the staff including Farida, Jystina, Melody and Raymond made our anniversary so special. They attended to every want, need or desire. We loved the salt water pool and the ambience of Junsui restaurant. A very memorable experience and thankful for a lovely stay!","5","2017-07"
"7 star hotel","You need to book . Arriving to the Burj Al Arab island you have to tell guards your confirmation number before they let you go there . Staff were brilliant from the moment we go there till we left could not do enough for you stay . Its a lot of money but seeing is believing is what this place is all about . Good wine list cocktails and snacks we had   view was great and the bar was out of this world . If you want to do something special this is the place to do it . Ask for a window seat they will do the best to get you one very very good place to be .","5","2017-07"
"Oh What a Divine Treat","My daughter and I booked for the High Tea on Sunday and wow........the service.....the hotel....absolutely stunning.  We were seated with a window view so we could also see the Sunset.  I had the champers (from south africa I might add😆....we started with a tray of the most daintiest delicious finger sandwiches I have ever tasted.  Then we had a hot drink served with a tray is scones and cream.....a tray of 6 different types of sweet treats came out, with a refill of tea....and we finished off the most beautiful evening with a cocktail.......well worth the money. I asked if I could take the small honey jar as a souvenir... (my daughter was so embarressed)but out waitress bought me a souvenir box with 2 little jars in.......we then took a tour to the sky bar with the waiter...
Book online or you won't be allowed in...treatment is well worthy of a 7 star hotel.  One lifetime wish box ticked....
Thank you to all the staff involved....","5","2017-07"
"Memorable Experience in Dubai 2016","Let me start by saying, we should always rate our own experiences, no others. Always look at the positive side of life, you will see there are a lot more nice than ugly. It is all in one self. I for one, are very open mind. When in Rome act and behave like a Roman, saying that. We had a great time in Dubai. Very nice experience from immigration to all the places we visit. Burj Al Arab tea time was very pleasant. We were not sit by the Windows but we got up of our seats and walked around without being disrupted to guests sitting on those tables. By others peoples comments perhaps it should be mentioned the additional charge for windows sitting preference? Or when available? Free of charges? Im very easy going i let bossiness dictate how to run their business how much to charged? But everyone have their own opinion. For starter everyone whom visit knows this is a very Luxury, expensive Hotel. If you cant afford it
Please don't complaint visit a place that suit your budget.  All was excellent, impeccable.
Thank you for the nice experience.
Good luck.
Will look forward yo visit again.","5","2017-07"
"1000 and 1 nights","Had  a panoramic suite and booked a Rolls Roye Phantom for the transport from and to the airport. 
The suite was marvellous so decided to take every morning breakfast in the room.

All staff members were efficient and outstanding with a smile en let me mentionned the butlers of the 6th level Deerpak and Daniel.","5","2017-07"
"Best experience of our visit to Dubai.","The service and the quality of all of the courses we received was just magical for Afternoon Tea. Very much a 'Highlight' of our holiday. The staff members that looked after us (Lena, Lota and Krish) were totally wonderful in their attitude towards us, (Made us feel like 'Royalty')","5","2017-05"
"Afternoon tea skyview bar.","We visited the Skyview bar at the top of the Burj today for afternoon tea. We paid £320, for two people but was very disappointed with the results. It's fabulous getting to the top but the minute we walked into the bar they greeted us and then asked us for more money to sit by the window. I hate being ripped off so we said no, we felt like second class citizens sitting at the back of the room as everyone else sat in a window seat. I would not mind if it was really busy but it was not and there where loads of empty seat at the window. I had to sit on a bench seat which was extremely uncomfortable. 
We got one glass of champagne each and the usual afternoon tea snacks, nothing special. 
It was lovely to be able to go and see the hotel but it really was very expensive for what you get. On a positive note the staff are lovely and it's not there fault they have to ask you for more money to sit by the window. My partner had a bottle of Budweiser and this cost us £15.00, so beware. 
Shame there is not a better way of seeing this hotel without being ripped off.","2","2017-07"
"Top!","Even I didn't enter in the hotel because of a very high ticket price. I was able to see it from the outside at the nextdoor beach. And the view was just perfect... I trully recommend this place for all tourist because it represents the symbol of Dubai.","5","2017-07"
"Poor Experience","The suite we stayed in was absolutely lovely in every respect and so were the staff however I felt like I was staying at any business hotel in the world. If luxury is what you are selling...then the experience fell short. The amenities are average at best.. We asked to play music...but no one knew what to do. We had a technical person add a wire to the TV and then no one knew what to do.  The staff is enthusiastic enough but other wise clueless. The management of this hotel has no clue what they are doing and how to provide a discreet and discerning service. From the doorman to the butler and room service.. . Everyone is in dire need of training. Try getting staff from the Oberoi. The breakfast experience in the coffee shop was noisy and chaotic... One evening one of the ladies in an effort to provide good service...tells us she has ""saved us some dessert"" from the Happy hours...she meant well.. but frankly at 2000 dollars a night.. I don't need you to save me stuff.. I just want great food and  great service. This is not called going over and above.... Basically you are in  a 7 star property with 4 star staff that is well meaning but poorly trained. Disappointed. We moved to the Jumeirah Beach Resort villas after that..  that was a much much better experience. Again I would like to emphasize that it was more than apparent that the management has not empowered their staff nor trained them for attention to detail. ","2","2017-07"
"8th stop going around the world","Going around the world how could you not stop at one of the most iconic hotels in the world?? Even if it is crazy expensive you have to stop there. We were there 4 nights and it is every bit as over the top as you might imagine. The physical structure is incredible to behold. The service is fabulous, almost smothering but they get a gold star for trying so hard. Biggest surprise was the food. After hitting major cities in the orient and Southeast Asia and staying at the best hotels and eating at the best restaurants we did not think the food could be beaten at this stop. It was. Bab Al Yam is their buffet restaurant on the ground floor. Wow! Fabulous choices and great quality . Chef Gert is very focused on making sure his restaurant pleases. Price not bad either - USD 30 for breakfast and 110 for dinner. We did not eat lunch there .This hotel does price their alcohol way too high- $50 for a glass of Champagne. Rooms are huge. Our 1 bedroom suite was about 1800 sq ft two stories. Had everything you could imagine EXCEPT a decent selection of channels for the TV. Only 3 US channels and a poor selection of sports channels. It happened to matter because the British Open was on and they had no channels that carried it. Their choices on music were awful as well. Spa was good and fitness center excellent. We asked for late departure due to a very late plane flight and had to fight to get until 5 PM. We did appreciate it but it was a Sunday night and probably slow anyway. If you need something keep pushing and they will probably come around. It is the Arabian nights crossed with Las Vegas. If you are ever in the Middle East you need to stop. You will not be disappointed .","4","2017-07"

"Cool n amazing 🦋","Coooooool

Amazing Experience of luxury 😊

Family enjoyed each and every moments 
Spent.

It's a kind of it's ownzzz
No comparisons....

A place to stay at least once to enjoy n realize the luxurious hospitality.","5","2017-07"
"One of a kind","I went there with my friend Elena. We both stayed at the Royal Place hotel for  a week and wanted to have tea at Burj Al Arab. Reservation needed to enter even the lobby. Everything is very secure and elegant. You step into the future when stepping into this hotel. We had tea time on the high floor and had the best view over the Star Islands and the city.
Magnificent.
I will stop by there again on my way to the Maldives next.","5","2016-08"
"A luxury holiday experience!","I would recommond anyone who wish to try a luxury holiday. This is the best place to experience. Location, facilities, transfer, waterpark, shops, restaurants, bar, club all in one place. You don't need to leave the hotel if you don't want to.","5","2017-07"
"Exquisite Experience fit for kings!","We checked in for a day and had booked 2 single bedroom suites. One for me and my wife and kids and the other for my wife's parents. The hotel had acceded to our request to arrange the two rooms next to each other. We were kept on the 15 th floor and the  view from the living room was splendid and we could get a good view of the sea as well as the city overlooking the Burj Khalifa. The bedroom was one level higher. The butlers were very helpful and helped us with everything we wanted. We celebrated our 7th wedding anniversary with a 7 star experience and the staff had arranged a special cake in the occasion to make memorable. My 4 yr old son loved the jacuzzi. The breakfast was good. The interior of the hotel was oozing with opulence and luxury with gold plated  interior fittings even in bathrooms. Swimming in infinity pool in the terrace was once in a lifetime experience with the view of the pool merging with that of the sea. 
Overall an awe inspiring experience of Arabian luxury at its eminence!","5","2017-06"
"Awesome!","Great hotel, gotta take a pic on the beach with it in the background. Staff was excellent and gave great recommendations for interesting places to visit to really make the best of our trip. Even if you don't stay here, make sure you take advantage of the photo opp!","5","2017-03"
"My stay burj july 2017","Love the hotel , theres nothing you cant love about this hotel as it is the only 7 star hotel in the world. When you stay here , you are the center of attention for all the staff . Love the rooms and they way they are done and those Hermes toiletries just make it perfect and the shower and jacuzzi is magnificent . The views are obviously all towards the sea just an amazing picturesque floor to ceiling wall which will help u bask in the blue waters of the sea while giving you a hint of the cities skyline and beaches. Perfectly pairs with a great cup of coffee. The only thing that was not to my liking was the food , i mean i spent just over 300 dollars on a meal for 2 and its so unfortunate that nothing was to my taste. Not the salad, the sides, the veal , the mixed grill , i mean absolute let down. Unfortunate. But expected as in most 5 stars . A small tip i would give to the managements who handle the room service and private dining menus please keep it simple and stupid , that never fails. The more arty they go with food the more blunders there are likely to occur. I dont mind spending 5000 dollars on a room in a night. But i do mind spending money and not getting satisfied with my food. So food my dear beloved ppl reading be wary of its expensive and its not gonna be what you expected. Apart from that love the over all experience the spa the infinity pool on the new deck the butler services. Its definitely the plae to have your parties or your weekend away with ur loved one. Hope this was helpful readers God bless.. 👍🏻","5","2017-07"
"Misread menu !","Took my wife and daughter to Scape Restaurant 
On arrival all good and very hospitable 
All food was of excellent quality and attentive service 
My one gripe is I ordered off the sunset menu and my wife and daughter ordered off the a la carte menu 
When it came to ordering my 3 rd course I was told by the waiter that took our original order the sunset menu was only for 2 people 
Why oh why did he not tell me /us that when we ordered !!??
Too say I spent a lot of money there and to be UNADVISED about the menu I was appalled 
It ruined what was a very good evening 
Someone did take a note of our complaint but nobody has contacted us 
Just a big shame as the food was of excellent quality ","1","2017-07"
"mükemmel","Its only one place around of the world, where you can have a drink of Cappuccino with golden powder on :) ..
you will feel a special there , don't miss to take a picture around...
Also try a shisha you will like a lot .
enjoy the life!","5","2016-08"
"Posh tea!","Had the pleasure of afternoon tea, one of the only ways you can enter the building is if you are staying or have a meal there. Stunning surroundings and service. Extensive tea menu and so many courses for tea you literally can't finish it all. Great sparkling date or prune juice instead of chambers. ","4","2016-08"
"Burj Al Arab Anniversary Visit","What can I say about this hotel that has not already been said by hundreds of visitors? 

The drive on the bridge whilst approaching Burj al Arab was itself an experience especially at night with all the bright lights. The interior was beautifully decorated with aquariums, fountains and more gold then I have ever seen. In my opinion, what made Burj Al Arab truly special were the workers. Their excellent customer service and the staff’s attentiveness with taking photos that we showed our friends and family made it a night to remember.  I and my wife went for our anniversary for dinner & drinks and late night shisha. We found the staff went above and beyond to accommodate and make this night truly special for us both. I would like to give a massive thank you to Kyawzin who works in Scape who literally went down to his knees to take amazing pictures for us & made us feel special. He also gave us a tour of the ground floor and gave us a great insight into the thought and effort that went into creating the Burj. I would also like to say a massive thank you to a gentleman that works in the sky view bar from Swaziland who again made this night a truly wonderful experience. The building was great but individuals like these made a good experience into a great one and something both me and my wife will remember for a long time. 

Burj al Arab was truly a fantastic experience and I would definably come back again after saving my pennies for next time.","5","2017-07"
"Luxury From Start to Finish","We checked in on a Thursday and checked out on the Saturday but for the two nights we were there, we were treated like royalty. It's as if they don't want you to lift a finger while you're there and will even endeavour to cater to the more obscure requests (A larger ice bucket was one of ours - it was so big they had to bring it on a trolley!). 

The new terrace which was not there last time we stayed was fantastic, although at this time of year a little hot. They did provide a little cooler bag containing small bottles of cold water, cold towels and even a cooling facial spray and the pool was temperature controlled so even the heat was not too much of a problem. 

Happy hour between 5:30pm and 8pm each day in the room is excellent and the butlers are very attentive. They give you unlimited free beverages and they're quite generous with the quantities (we asked for extra cans of coke just in case the drink was too strong and they provided them at no cost). 

Breakfast in Bab Al Yam was ok, although not to the same standards as the other F&B options in the hotel. I would put this down to how busy they were both mornings. Still, the food was of a good quality and when we requested pork, the waiter organised it for us even though they weren't serving it in the restaurant. 

All in all, it was a great weekend and the staff in the hotel really know how to make you feel important from the moment you check in, to the moment you check out. 

It's a 'staycation' that I'll remember for a long time.","5","2017-07"
"INCREDIBLE","Its the BAA.... its over the top , but if you can afford it ... stay there at least once in your lifetime. The new pool , cabana and lounge area is first class, the service excellent and the rooms, well.......... you have to stay there to aptly describe them ! 2 levels,lounge room, 2 bathrooms , amazing amenities, a 24 butler and more.","5","2017-06"
"AMAZING","stayed for 4nights in this wonderful hotel,on the 1st night we eat at bab.al.yam.you must go here,we eat here here the rest of our break,gert the headchief greets you in the morning and evening,and will make you anything you wont.phershant,treats you like royalty,stayed on the 12th floor with wonderful views,butlers derry,miguel,bashir,nothing to trouble for these guys.the new pools are a treat.i could go on and on,but thanks very much burj hope one day we can come back.","5","2017-07"
"Burj Al Arab joy.","Afternoon dinner/tea at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai  an experience to not ever forget. Six star luxury arrival with sixteen courses of excellent cuisine. Service the ultimate experience anywhere in the world.","5","2017-03"
"Opulence and excellence in hotel hospitality","For the business or leisure traveler that wants to be pampered and treated to an unparalleled experience   Burj Al Arab set the standard for a long time and so high that no hotel will EVER match it.
The level of service, the attention to detail, the quality of service and the design of the hotel and its amenities are more then the 7 stars the hotel has . It deserves 10 stars","5","2017-07"
"Sensational afternoon tea","If you ever wondered is it worth paying more than you normally would, then afternoon tea in the BAA will in no way disappoint.
This place is sensational starting with the approach to BAA and then the architecture and internal environment.
It is amazing and, oh yes, the afternoon tea.
Make sure you allow yourself at least two hours. I will say no more!!","5","2017-07"
"AMAZING","It has been my dream to stay here since I came for afternoon tea and finally managed to save up and visited in May for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday. It was everything I imagined and more. I was made to feel special and nothing was too much trouble. My butler, Saj George, was wonderful and brought me cake and flowers in the evening of my birthday which was lovely, he looked after me very well. Even though I asked lots of questions he always took the time to find an answer for me, excellent customer service.
The room was out of this world, I couldn't stop walking around it and spent much of my 2 days inside! I had breakfast served in the room which was plentiful and delicious and had one evening meal, also delicious. The ammenities were lovely. Bed was divine. Took me a while to realise everything had a remote control!! I enjoyed the Terrace, the infinity pool was beautiful and not too busy. I also spent some time in the spa and the pool again was pure luxury. I had a lovely view of the sunset from my suite and I can honestly say I have never been so happy as my stay here. Personally I loved the decor, yes very fancy and OTT but that is what I expected. I had one issue with being woken up in the morning by window cleaners but this was resolved quickly and professionally by the management team much to my satisfaction, they provided complimentary airport transfer for me which more than made up for the inconvenience so I was very happy. Although I said it was a bucket list thing to stay here once in my life, I definitely wish to come back again and hope to see some familiar staff. I have shared my experience with all my friends and family and recommend them all to stay here even just for one night to experience the pure luxury and joy that I have experienced here.
Thank you for making me feel so special, I will never forget this experience.
Kind regards
Lisa","5","2017-05"
"Amazing","Worth every star! This is definitely a bucket list job.

You must try the afternoon tea and the spa there.

Staff could not do enough for you. They had a menu for the beds to make sure every aspect of your stay was the best possible.","5","2016-08"
"An extraordinary hotel - perfect escapism","Usually I'm more at home in the easy-going, surprise-free setting of a Holiday Inn Express than any folkloric luxury hotel, but enduring curiosity about the Burj al Arab (coupled with low season prices) won out in the end. 

Yes, everything is designed to within an inch of its life. Everything from my eggs benedict at breakfast to the amenities in the pool's changing rooms bore the marks of a thorough, skilled and conscientious - albeit unrestrained - creator. When applied to the hotel's interior design though, this approach leads to a certain amount of overdone gaudiness. I expected to hate that, but actually it fuels the sense of escapism; the endless gilding, upholstering, moulding and engraving acting as a surrealist barrier separating you from your everyday routine. Combined with the endless pleasant little surprises as you move around the hotel using its facilities, it really stay the experience above any other good hotel I know. 

I arrived via the hotel's own airport transfer service. Even though my flight arrived almost an hour early, the greeter and car were waiting. This was nevertheless at 5am so I didn't expect my room to be ready. The hotel arranged a very comfortable place for me to change clothes and brush my teeth before I set out to see Dubai for the first time. 

I was there on my own, so chatted with the staff perhaps more than I would have otherwise. Even though Europeans and Asians just staying 1-2 nights to satisfy their curiosity (myself included) are the Burj's bread and butter nowadays, interactions with the staff always felt genuine and eager. Every staff member I spoke to had worked there for three to eight years.

Panoramic suite 1212 was assigned to me. It is as spacious and comfortable as the photos suggest. It is on the Palm side, but not quite high enough to have a good view of the form. Next time I would try for a room on the Downtown side. The butler kindly organised a tour around the hotel so I could see all the restaurants while they were still empty. 

The swimming pool and spa area is serene and comfortable. I was always alone there, as guests seemingly favour the beach and outdoor pools, but with temperatures over 45 degrees centigrade, that was out of the question for me. 

One small thing went wrong: the hotel transfer back to the airport never showed up. It was arranged around a month in advance directly with the hotel, but in the meantime the booking had disappeared. However this turned into a showcase of the staff's attentiveness and resourcefulness: just in passing I mentioned to the porter collecting my suitcase from my room (I sincerely regret not noting his name) that I had booked a hotel car. Later in the reception he recognised me and explained that he couldn't find any transfer booking, and me showing him the e-mail confirmation wasn't going to make a car and driver materialise on time. As I had been distributing my last dirhams in tips all morning, I needed a taxi that would accept cards (they exist but are rare). The gentleman arranged this after a few calls. Ultimately I lost 20 minutes but saved €100, so the little hiccup ended rosily. 

Overall, I cherish my time at the Burj. The hotel contains plenty to surprise and delight experienced travellers, and furthermore it is great to see a team so in command of what they do.","5","2017-07"
"Nice design, good for photo stop","Nice building along the beach great for photo stop if touring the city. There is an expensive ""7 star"" hotel inside and restaurants. The architecture is quite recognizable as it has been shown in movies and other things.","4","2017-07"
"Horrendously expensive and over-rated","Clearly the most expensive meal ever in my life - over £425 for two and with no alcohol!  Having said that, the food was really good and we were fortunate to have been served by a nice and friendly waiter.   The views are of course amazing and the decor in this restaurant is definitely unique (but I will not spoil the surprise here!).  I have no desire to return here.","4","2017-05"
"Al Muntaha dinner for two","The food in this restaurant is fantastic. Fine dining which left me full. When I ordered blue lobster with macaroni pasta, I wasn't expecting a whole de shelled lobster. So lovely not to have to spend the night cracking shells. There was a bit of an issue, as my partner has a severe tomato allergy, we asked for no tomato anywhere on his food especially uncooked but his food came with a cooked tomato on it. 
My cocktail was the most amazing design, complete with a China handbag, nail varnish and lipstick, containing various liqueurs. 
Possibly the most expensive meal I'll ever had but worth it. The views are wonderful too.","5","2017-07"
"Best by Far!!","Luxury at its best and service at its best as well. this hotel is number one. the room is vast and comfortable, the food is amazing with all types of restaurants. the beach is calm and the views you can have from high floors is simply magestic.","5","2016-11"
"Afternoon Tea at The Burj al Arab","Organised afternoon tea in the Burj al Arab for a Sunday at 4pm requesting  a window view. Cost was quite expensive,  £300 for two , but then everything is in Dubai . Make sure you have your email with booking reference to hand as you approach the barrier .Security guards will check your booking then permit your taxi to enter the driveway up to the hotel.
We arrived 15minutes early so we could look around the hotel. Then we approached the sky lift where a receptionist took our names and organised the lift to take us to the Sky Lounge on the 22nd floor .
The waiters were extremely attentive explaining what would happen .The view was fantastic and yes we got a window seat. ( you don't want to sit in the middle as the view would not be so wonderful in my opinion) The waiter asked if we were celebrating a special occasion .If you are they present you with a red rose and chocolate cake towards the end of your afternoon tea .
The staff took photos for us then the afternoon tea experience began. The champagne was poured then courses upon courses arrived starting with a panacotta then a quiche  followed be sorbet .Next there were sandwiches , savouries  and finally a Burj al Arab shaped cake stand with scones, fruit slice ,gingerbread ,cheesecake  and much more.In fact too much . They asked if we wanted to take away they left overs but we refused. Soft drinks, coffees  and teas as much as you want and extra sandwiches .We were allowed to stay until 7pm as then the Sky Lounge is set up for drinks . We had another glass of champagne at a small cost . 
We thoroughly enjoyed this experience and could not fault the sevice .","5","2017-07"
"Afternoon tea with a view ","Wow! Visited for my 40th birthday and was blown away. Immaculate presentation and attention to detail, plus a cake with candle and rose to celebrate. Can't recommend this enough. Amazing hotel to see inside too","5","2017-06"
"Luxurious resort but elegance minimized..","We stayed two nights on our way back from South Africa to San Francisco! Loved the world class service and comforts! Team Al Arab was on it!! Only negative which we thought took away the elegance to this lovely resort was too many tourist just walking around in the lobby taking pictures! Hoards of buses of Asian tourist there perhaps for their famous ""tea"" and part of tour but when you see that lobby has turned out into a playground and you are almost obstructed by these short term visitors - you wonder??. Otherwise from concierge to room service and quality of room was excellent!","4","2017-07"
"Nothing like anything","What a massive place , massive hotel. Undoubtedly one of the best there ever has been. Had been there for tea. No photography allowed inside. A thing for ages to be cherished. We went in and were completely astounded by the hotel and the professionalism of the staff . Great place all in all !!","5","2017-06"
"Excellent ","Me and my wife went to the sky lounge for afternoon tea booked a table next to the window . The seven course tea was amazing firstly the sheer quality of the food and I was surprised by how much they gave the views were amazing definitely well worth the money . There isn't a place like it anywhere , I didn't get the name of the staff member serving us but he deserves a special mention he made us feel special gave us more than the required service and also was very informative about Dubai and Burj Al Arab he was a talkative gentleman who from what I saw was really liked by all the staff I didn't get his name down but he was there on 6th July at 4pm but hopefully the hotel can figure out who he is so his efforts are appreciated. Also abin who works in Scape lounge on terrace was amazing a special of him his service was 7 star its people like these that make this place 7 star beside the decor 

Thanks allot I will definitely come back again thank you for the memory it was my birthday and they made my day special both at sky lounge and Scape lounge","5","2017-07"

"ROYALTY AT ITS FINEST","We enjoyed this hotel as a family of four in July 2013. Although years have passed, the memories our to be cherished a lifetime. The rooms are enormous, upstairs and downstairs, Hermes parfume for us and sweet treats every morning were delivered to our room. They did not miss a detail. Enjoyed the underwater hotel for its atmosphere more than the food itself. 
Breakfast buffet was AMAZING!!! the sailboat omelets and pastries were my fav. 

This is a hotel that must be on everyone's bucket list.","5","2016-08"

"Great!","Certainly, it's the best hotel in the Middle East. 
They take care of every detail and make your stay unforgettable.
We stayed the panoramic room and we loved it! We totally recommend that views. 
Do not miss the sunset from the swimming pools.
I will be back soon!","5","2017-06"
"An amazing stay ","We stayed for 3 nights during Ramadan and it was fantastic. The pool areas were so quiet and relaxing. The restaurants were great with fantastic food choices. Our suite was beautiful and the service from the butlers was great. We had a generous glass of wine and a treat from them every evening at about 6 o'clock. 
There seemed to be some day guests in a cabana who were quite noisy which is a bit annoying as a resident but we just moved to the quieter pool. We will be returning next year. ","5","2017-06"
"Costly visit for an average tourist but worthy of a visit","You are only allowed into the premises if you have a confirmed booking as a guest and this has to be shown to the guards at the gate. The building is magnificient and service within the hotel is superb. The menu is available on-line so you can decide on what fits best to your budget 😊","4","2017-07"
"Excellent staff , Service and rooms","my wife and i had a stay there about 3 weeks ago and i thought i have to write a review about the staff and service. we had a quiet 3 nights so spent a lot of time around the pool , Scape bar and in the breakfast area.
At breakfast time we were served by numerous good staff but the one we see each time we visit is Inden .What a lovely helpful young man who is always smiling.The F&B manager at breakfast is Mr Saltish who has been there many many years and a font of knowledge and very very nice guy.
Then its onto the pool area and pool bar. Again so so nice. You have Vimal who is so so polite , always his big smile lights up the day. Also around the pool/beach area you have Thierry who is a very knowledgeable young man who loves his football and shows genuine interest in me and my opinions on football. Abbas is always on hand first thing every morning and makes a point of cleaning mine and my wifes sunglasses during the day. Cyril and geoff are new guys but growing with confidence every day.Then we get to the pool bar and we have Sheehan and and Shiv. Both guys with lots of personality and always happy. stop for one quick drink in pool bar and we talk so much my wife has to come to rescue me !!

The we have Scape bar where we were lucky enough to meet the most knowledgeable Sommelier i have ever met. His name is Slobedan. WE met him last year at the exclusive fish restaurant in the ground floor- Mr Outlaws restaurant. He remembered us and we discussed loads of different things from wine to champagne to whiskies. I thought i knew a bit but about one per cent of his knowledge . These staff made our trip so enjoyable but sadly made it go tooo quick. But we will return one day soon to hopefully see them all again. Thank you to you all.","5","2017-06"
"Amazing hotel!!","We went to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary. The hotel is worth to visit, it´s beautiful inside and outside. The customer service is amazing!

We went for the afternoon tea, they have a lot of different tea options, the food was well prepared and delicious. I went with two children and we order a la carte for them from a children´s menú. The food for them was delicious, a meat very wel prepared. 

They also decorate a special cake for my parents.

This hotel is definetely, a must see if you visit Dubai.","5","2017-03"
"Skyview bar & gold on 27","This review is based on afternoon tea at the skyview bar and gold on 27. Unfortunately i haven't stayed in the hotel just yet but ill be back one day to :) 

On incital impression of the hotel i was a bit under whelmed. No one opened the door for our car and i felt i have had a better receiption at other cheaper/5 star hotels. If i had paid the price to stay the night i would have been very upset about this as this is not a good first impression. 

We entered the hotel and was told where to sign in. After signing in we had a wander around the lobby and then were shown up to the skyview bar. 

From here the service was good, and attentive. Each course was presented well, however if your a picky eater like myself make sure you are aware what is on offer. We came for a celebration and was given a lovely cake and rose. This was a nice touch.

After our two hour time slot we carried on to the gold on 27 bar. Here was filled with lots of posers to start. However after they had their one cocktail and photoshoot they all seemed to leave. The cocktail list is impressive and our server helped reccomend his favourite. I didnt get the servers name (he's philipino if that helps) but he was a jem and was so nice to us even offering us more cake which we declined as we were so full already. 

We then left and got the door staff to order a taxi for us, again not as friendly as i would expect in this establishment. 

To be completely honest with you i was expecting the wow factor especially as we spent alot of money in matter of hours (a little money to some but alot to others). And feel that the service i recieved is on par with other places that i havent spent as much money in (one example being at.mosphere at the burj if not better service there). With such a price tag on this establishment i expect more, especially from the door staff as first impressions are everything! ","4","2017-06"
"Iftar Dinner @ Al Falak","We really loved the place and ambience and particularly the view of the city sitting inside the banquet. Less options for veggie but really tasteful.  Even the waiting area and the fountains next to escalator is also really good.","4","2017-06"
"Awesome! Afternoon tea in Sky Bar","What a fantastic afternoon tea, 8 course and champagne, the views are out of this world, beautiful cakes,sorbets,deserts and sandwiches. The staff are second to none they are incredible. Would have to go and do it all over again next time I am in Dubai. I loved every second of this. Whilst pricey","5","2017-06"
"Amazing","Went there for dinner. It is spectacular. The chef made food especially catering to our dietary requirements. First class service and what an experience. The view was incredible. Beautiful beautiful beautiful :) will come back!","5","2017-06"
"Week at the Burj ","Second visit in 6 months and enjoyed it better than the first time 

All staff are amazing, nothing is to much trouble for them.. especially our butlers, the staff in the Talise gym and spa and the breakfast staff.. 

Weather was unbearable 48 degrees most days.. to hot to sunbathe. 

The only problem is all the tourists who are constantly in the lobby posing for pictures.. it is a nuisance when you cannot get Into the hotel due to the crowds in the lobby. 

As always the full size Hermes in the bathroom was amazing with the added benefits of full size sample for males which were not available when we visited in November. 

If you visit Atlantis make sure you book or you will not get in..the hotel did not appear busy. Had a tour of the presidential and panoramic suites amazing!! 

Immaculate hotel with lovely genuine staff that make a difference.  The staff went out of there way to make our stay pleasurable. They even remembered we liked an ice bucket in the room and left one everyday for us..it's the little things that count. The tonics to go with the gin were also a lovely gesture! Along with the free bottle of white wine 😀

Will visit again soon hopefully.

"Still the best Hotel!","Burj Al Arab has a certain myth and especially for myself, working in hospitality since a young age I have always been in awe of this place! 
Been there 8 years ago and while not much has changed in terms of design, the suites amenities and particularly the staff and service levels are still up there of 7 stars!!!  In my opinion unbeatable by the likes of Armani & Co.

Noteworthy to mention: Reuben & Alex in the Skyview Bar & Dejan, the Restaurant Manager!","5",
"A luxurious Meal at a luxurious hotel","Visited this luxurious hotel for a meal. Ate in the Sadd el Eddar Lounge which is situated on the first floor. Plenty of choice on the al a carte menu. I decided to have a Set meal to iclude entree, main meal and dessert. Aside from this i had as extra a lentil soup, chicken wings and a Cappachino coffee dusted with gold. All of this cost 93.00. Food is of very high standard.Yes it is expensive. But this is a once in a life time experience and when here indulge in this wonderful place. Staff were very helpful and very polite. Surroundings are so elegant. Even if youre not staying here i would highly recommend having an evening out here purely for the experience of being surrounded in pure luxury. I deffinately dont regret it.","5","2017-06"
"Wonderful experience - wonderful staff","We have visited this iconic hotel twice; once for cocktails in the Skyview Bar and once to the Bab Al Yam restaurant for breakfast.It is wonderful; the staff are so welcoming, friendly and attentive; the surroundings are breathtaking. Yes, it's expensive, but the memories created there are worth every dirham. Treat yourself!","5","2017-06"
"Home from Home....well I can dream, can't I :)","We stayed here for the third time and I can honestly say that the service was excellent. When we arrived, we were taken straight to our room (even though we were very early). 

The staff here are great, everyone we spoke to (Butlers etc.) always greeted us with 'welcome back', which added a personal touch. Some of the staff in the restaurants even recognised us from our last stay and came over to say hello.

The staff (thanks Luis) were always helpful and friendly and provided an excellent service. 

Our package included a Cabana, which I have to say we made full use of. The cabana has wifi, a tv and a free mini bar with soft drinks and water. 

Apart from staying in the most famous hotel in the world, you also have access to the other Jumeirah Hotels in this location, so you have a huge selection of restaurants to choose from. 

We stayed in the Panoramic One Bedroom Suite which had great views.  The bedroom and bathroom are on the upper floor, with a large living space including a bar on the lower floor.  

The Skyview Bar is nice to visit at night, however, make sure you book early as it is very popular. 

This is a great hotel and if you have the opportunity to stay here, I think it is well worth it, based on my experiences here.","5","2017-06"
"Interesting experience, unique hotel.","I was there in December 2012 to be honest (cant put it that far back on Tripadvisor). But it still stays with me. What an experience. The hotel is so unique and it is such a special place. The highlights for me were the underwater restaurant where the waiter told us that people could take a small submarine for lunch from that restaurant. The Rooms are all massive from what I could see and the views are amazing. It is a bit overdone for my liking and it's very expensive but its worth a weekend or 2 nights just for the experience!","4","2016-07"
"Went to all restaurants very good food and drinks","Great hotel ,great conditions to stay, very clean very luxury and great views!!!! !!!!IWent to all restaurants very good food and drinks.Skyview bar is great , thanks for surprising my wife with table on right view that i've asked.Special greetings to Sanjay and Revira

"Amazing!","Will never forget our visit to this place! Living in Dubai for more than 2 decades I visited this landmark a few times and viewed it from wild wadi (that view!) The architectural aspect from the inside is just as breathtaking as it is from the outside! ","5","2017-06"
"Everyone who goes to Dubai should experience this once","Everyone who visits Dubai should try to visit this iconic property at least once. It is so over the top, it is truly striking. The architecture is amazing. The interior design, though, not so much. Think Sheik Chic tacky.  The service and hospitality is immeasurable and our butler made our stay truly special. The restaurants can be skipped. Mediocre food at astronomical prices but it is cool to point at a picture of the hotel and know that we are in ""that"" space up top.  Memorable, one of a kind experience. ","4","2017-06"
"Sky view Bar -- Tourist Trap - Avoid!","The security staff at this place are very unhelpful. We arrived a few minutes early and was ordered by security to wait downstairs until the exact time of my booking....

When we got there I ordered a cosmo... it's was pretty weak in taste, so I gently complained. However the staff were unwilling to do anything... when you are paying an ultra premium price for a drink you would expect staff to be helpful!

So what was supposed to be a lovely evening ended up as a huge disappointment.

So folk, in my opinion I would urge fellow travellers to seek other venues for special/romantic evenings.","1","2017-06"
"Pay for play","Many times we've been to Dubai and stayed in the top suites in the other 5star hotels. We always reckoned that BAA was never going to live up to the hype. We are very demanding hotel guests - we pay , we expect. So we decided to give it a whirl this tone. 10 nights in April. The new beach club addition was the deciding factor. And whilst I can always find a negative if I want to ( the over 12 rule for dining - my well behaved daughter is 9) I want to single out the rooms (club suite on floor 19) the beach club and cabanas and the breakfast etc - it's the staff and in particular the butlers and pool team and indeed the senior management whom engage with all guests that really give you the 7 star experience. We're demanding. And yet I can't wait to return - as a benchmark we've done OMAN, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, NY, LA and live must sometimes stay London so hopefully our review is informed. So blow the budget, waste your children's inheritance and college fund, make a wasteful investment decision. And check in and treat yourself, we only passing through once! Good luck","5","2017-04"
"Afternoon Tea at Burj Al Arab","A must do for anyone visiting Dubai and wanting to experience fanastic views excellent afternoon tea and a beautiful Hotel. WOW . What an experience Made the booking whilst on a cruise to the area and although expensive well worth the money. fantastic staff and as would be expected impeccable service.","5","2017-06"
"Silver Anniversary to remember","We prebooked an evening of cocktails in the Skyview lounge by email to celebrate our anniversary somewhere memorable and iconic. The lift whizzed us to the top floor where we enjoyed cocktails,wine and coffee overlooking the evening lights of Dubai. Expect to pay about £40 a cocktail with current UK exchange rate. We were presented with a complimentary rose and cake to commemorate our special day which was a lovely touch. Dress code was smart casual, no trainers or shorts. We visited at 930pm which was perfect as by 11pm it was very full.","5","2017-06"
"Fabulous stay!","Just back from an excellent 4 day stay at the BAA. Even though we arrived at the hotel at 7am we were still able to check into our room. The room was huge and exactly like the photos on the website.  We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary whilst we were there and the staff presented us with a cake, roses and a card to help us celebrate. The staff are all lovely and go out of their way to make your stay an experience to remember.
We had breakfast each morning at Bab Al Yam which provided plenty of choice and we also had our dinner there on two nights.  We also tried the Asian restaurant Junsui where the staff excelled by making dishes especially for me when I told them I was a vegetarian from special prawn crackers to non spicy curry.
We used the gym, the outdoor pools and played snooker in the room by the library and all the facilities were spotlessly clean.
On our last day, at our request, we were shown around the the whole hotel. I particularly wanted to see the Nathan Outlaw restaurant to take some photos which was amazing as too was the Al Falak Ballroom. Absolutely stunning!
Overall we had a fabulous stay and would definitely stay again.Thank you for giving us these wonderful memories.","5","2017-06"
"Simply stunning and Extraordinary hotel","Overall experience was mesmerising and spectacular. It was really a fabulous hotel. Great view with loads of amenities. The staff are excellent and so helpful. We enjoyed the beach area and relaxed and has a access to Wild Wadi water park also. There are numerous restaurants available both here and at the sister hotels. Great selection and choice of food. We had great meals wherever we ate. Since we stayed in Jumeirah hotel, so has an access to the beach area and see the awesome view of this property. Overall experience was mesmerizing and spectacular. Finally, I must say, it’s one of best experiences in my life.","5","2017-05"
"A must see ","Myself and my one year old daughter when for breakfast here. The hotel is breathtaking. Beautifully finished. I was in awe. As soon as you drive up you will feel amazed. Words cannot describe. 
The Team at the Burj were also amazing. Making time for my daughter and evening taking pictures for us and playing with her. Will definitely stay here a night or two next time in Dubai just for the experience. ","5","2017-05"
"Birthday gift for my wife and the best night of my life!","To celebrate my wife's 34th birthday, I decided to celebrate it with our three children at Burj Al Arab.  We stayed for one night in an amazing most luxuries suite. We were all taken care of with kindness and caring.  My wife and I had dinner at the aquarium and then Shisha at Escape.  It was the best night of my life!","5","2017-05"
"Burj Al Arab - Sheer Luxury ","The Burj is the finest hotel in the world. Stunning and luxurious rooms, pools, restaurants and facilities.

It is one of those experiences that everyone must do once in their lifetime, or maybe twice........

Go and find out for yourself ","5","2017-05"
"Very disappointed and would not recommend - a lot nicer hotels in Dubai and half the price!","Do not be sucked into the stigma of ""7 star"" hotel, or best hotel in Dubai, by far the worse I've stayed in in Dubai and I've stayed in approximately 10 hotels in the UAE during my residency, there are a lot nicer and cheaper options, my favourites being the Park Hyatt (Abu Dhabi and Dubai), Anantara, Shangri'la (Abu Dhabi) One and Only Royal Mirage and Fairmont Ajman if you would like other options.  See my comments below of my extremely disappointing stay at the Burj al Arab, please do not waste your money!

Me and my fiancé came to the Burj al Arab to celebrate our recent engagement for one night stay.  Upon arrival, we were disappointed with the number of tourists in the lobby of the hotel, possibly the worse arrival to a hotel we have experienced.  We were soon taken to our room and informed that the butler would be with us soon to show us around the room, this did not happen.  The room was impressive in terms of grandeur, however, it was so old and dated, to the point it felt dirty.  The highlight of the room, was the bath and the toiletries.  Please note that there are also no balconies to the hotel rooms.

After unpacking, we went down to the pool.  The new pool area is stunning and very lovely, however, this does not go with the hotel at all.  We were not greeted by any pool attendants and had to take the towels ourselves and find our own beds, which was not an issue as the pool was quite quiet, however, the beds we chose, we had no table and no umbrella.  In other hotels in the UAE, they are extremely helpful and there to meet your every need.  I was able to find a spare table and bring this over to our beds, however, we could not manoeuvre the umbrellas and it took approximately 5-10 minutes to even see any staff to ask for assistance, a level of service that is not expected, especially when it is summer and the pool was not busy to warrant this lack in care.  I also noticed that at the back of the hotel where the part of the building is white was extremely dirty and not a nice sight.

For dinner, we were going to order room service but decided against this as we did not like the room, nor felt comfortable in it so we decided to go to the international buffet on the ground floor, Al Mal I believe it was called.  We had an entertainer voucher and upon arrival to the restaurant, I mentioned to the lady on the desk that we had a voucher and asked if we could use this and charge it to the room which she confirmed.  After about 10 minutes of being at our table, the Matre'd then arrived to inform us that as we are staying in the hotel we could not use the voucher, which was extremely confusing as it should not matter and I have stayed in other Jumeirah hotels (Zabeel Saray and Al Qasr) and we've been able to do this.  Therefore, we paid in cash to use the voucher.  The selection at dinner was very poor for AED400 per person (without the voucher).  For example, you had roast beef which was full of fat but not trimmings to go with the beef.

For breakfast, we went back to the same restaurant for the breakfast buffet, which was possibly one of the worse breakfast buffets I have experienced in UAE hotels.  On our table were 4 jam pots, 3 of which were open and empty.  I had to go around to another 2 tables before I could find an unopened jar of strawberry jam, I found this disgusting.  I also had to ask 2 separate waiters for a bottle of water as they do not offer complimentary water at breakfast.  Again, I thought this was extremely poor considering it is 40 degree heat outside and I for one, only drink water, I do not like juice or tea or coffee, so what was I supposed to drink instead . . .","2","2017-05"
"BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ONE NIGHT STAY","Trip Advisor you restrict my ability to praise this hotel by limiting me to a rating out of 5 only - when there should be an opportunity to rate this amazing hotel 7*!!! This is a truly amazing hotel and having travelled the world and stayed in a fair sprinkling of luxury hotels, I believe I know what I am talking about. From the time you arrive to the time you depart; you are truly pampered. Thank you to everyone for such a great, but all too short, stay!!! ","5","2017-06"
" Beyond expectation and imagination","Spent today (4pm sitting) enjoying ""afternoon tea"" in the Skybar. Simply unreal. Yes, it's a lot of money, but if you can find a way to afford it, it's worth every single penny. Also, well worth spending the notional extra few pounds to secure a window table and then just sit back and enjoy breath taking views, surroundings, food and service. A truly world class experience unlike anywhere else on earth. Thank you for a simply unforgettable afternoon. Wonderful hotel too, of course!! Can't recommend highly enough.","5","2017-06"
"7 diamond....","Quite an experience ever for the well travelled person..  Exceeds any other hotel I have stayed in, in all parameters.   The property in well place central in Dubai making it easy to access other attractions.  The wow factor of building, service food, and hospitality is off the chart..  I don't recommend for the tight budgeted...","5","2017-05"
"Expensive but worth it","A very fancy experience I had there.
The view from the top to the bottom of the city was beautiful and inspiring.
I loved Dubai for so many reasons... 
Don't forget the check out the desert capping Safari that was my favorite too.","5","2017-06"
"Outstanding again","Fifth time and as outstanding as ever. Particular thanks to our Butler Uday for his very professional service, always provided with a smile, to Asheen for his usual wonderful assistance and to Albin for his help as always. Still the kids' favourite hotel !","5","2017-06"
"excellant experience","we had a lovely drink here and cannot fault service or quality. we had a bottle wine looking over the night sky line in Dubai ... very relaxing and highly recommend .. a must do as we were a honeymoon couple I was given a rose to celebrate .. we had no food but of what we seen looked excellent","5","2016-06"
"Culinary Flight","Part of my birthday holiday my wife booked the culinary flight at the Burj Al Arab. The service was excellent and we enjoyed the food and experience however I extremely disappointed when the bill arrived. Yes it was good but very overpriced and not worth the money. As I said the service and staff treated us very well and the orchestra played happy birthday and presented me with a cake. Try to get a buggy back to the JBH was another story with the front staff having words with one driver as he asked us to get out as he was not going our way after being told to get in that buggy leaving us standing there as he drove off. Plus side rather than get a golf buggy ride back we had a 7 series BMW.","3","2017-05"
"most luxurious hotel!","We would like to thank you all to make our visit memorable and its truly a luxury destination which one should visit, we had our time with a meal over here....clean, calm, courteous, warmly staff.... it is the most beautiful hotel in the world. 
The decor can only be described as opulent. We waited and enjoyed the wonderful view of the beach, sea and surrounding area. We were given the prime seating are with views to die for, we were treated as royalty which made this visit extra special.","4","2016-07"
"Amazing Afternoon Tea","Booked my husband a surprise for our Anniversary whilst staying in Dubai and I'm so pleased I did. From start to finish the experience was awesome!! The hotel itself with the trademark sail looks fantastic and promises so much, on entering the foyer you are not disappointed in any way, the decor can only be described as opulent. Fish tank as you go up the escalator, fountains at the top, a carpet you sink into and designer shops all around. We arrived early and went to check in for the meal, were booked in by a beautifully dressed and very welcoming hostess and advised to return at the allotted time. We waited and enjoyed the wonderful view of the beach, sea and surrounding area. As we had checked in 3rd in the 'queue ' we were taken with two other couples in a glass lift up to the 27th floor in seconds!! Again as we checked in early we were given (I think) the prime seating are with views to for for. And so it began, champagne, 7 courses of fabulous food, a waiter who was so attentive throughout and was happy to chat and explain our menu.  The teas and coffees on offer were extensive, juices etc and if you wanted more of anything offered you only had to ask. At the end we were presented with a rose and a Happy Anniversary cake.  The event is expensive but well worth the cost, we were treated as royalty from arrival to departure. If you want to see this designer hotel but are unable to afford to stay, this is definitely the way to do it. ","5","2016-06"

"Great experience","Four nights in a Panoramic Suite. Was an amazing room - two stories, huge bathroom, great views etc. As others have remarked, the lobby is really over the top but I think there are two things that really make this a property worth visiting:

1. The butter service: I have stayed in lots of hotel that advertise this but it is normally a useless perk (if I'm picking the phone up for the butler, I may as well call room service or housekeeping). Here, the butlers (always seemed to be two on duty) sit at the landing on the floor so they are there as soon as you step out of the elevator). Going for dinner? Let me arrange a car? Have dinner reservations? Let me call and reconfirm. Got heavy bags from shopping? Let me carry those to the room. Proactive and useful - made a difference to my trip. 

2. The pool deck/terrace:  we had a cabana included in our package which was great but the whole area is superb. Well designed, good pools, nice food and drinks and great staff. All around classy ambiance save for the Chinese tourists taking pictures of sunbathing guests.... creepy but they leave as soon as the weather warms up!

Negatives? Not much. Thought the welcome ""date non--alcohol"" wine was a cheap effort and not befitting of a hotel of this standard. Also mysteriously had a baby bed in our room when we arrived. 

Had some difficulties booking spa treatments via email - just a bit of laziness by the staff there but was fixed when I emailed the reservations folks. 

Food in the Arabian restaurant was average. I doubt many people staying here really are interested in buffet food. High quality ala carte would be better. Breakfast was great, but strangely not as good as some of their sister properties nearby. Still, good quality. 

All-in-all, a great, fun place to visit. Expensive but I felt it was good value for money. Will return!","5","2017-05"

"BURJ AL ARAB HIGH TEA AT THE SAHN EDDAR","This was a ""once in a lifetime"" experience.  The surroundings were beautiful.  They first served an assortment of 5 sandwiches which were absolutely delicious.  this was followed by Roasted Artichoke & Spinach Quiche and then by Lemon Sorbet.  This was followed by 2 freshly baked scones with Devonshire clotted cream and jam and then signature french pastries followed by little cakes.

Because it was a special feast day, there was no alcohol served, but we were given a glass of sparkling prune juice......very nice!!  The teas were just out of this world!!  I picked a Rooibos tea with chocolate and chili.

The staff were extremely attentive, and we were given a fresh plate and the table swept of crumbs after each course.

The cost was exhorbitant however, at approximately AUS $188 (AED 560) per person.  So it would have to be a special occasion!!  Also, there is a dress code, men must wear proper shoes, long trousers and long shirt and ladies long pants or dress","4","2017-04"

"Lunch ruined by poor service","I visited the Burj Al Arab, with my family, for lunch as this was something my wife had wanted to do for a while. The hotel looked fantastic and as we walked towards the restaurant we became more exited due to the elegance of the decor. On our arrival we had to wait to be seated despite booking months in advance. Once seated the service we received was average at best. My wife was offered wine, the rest of my family were only offered water after declining wine. Find it hard to believe that this restaurant only serves two types of beverage. After this the service was extremely slow. The entire meal took almost three hours. During this time there were no further drinks offered. The meal in itself was delicious. After the meal we asked for the cheque and we noticed we had been over charged. When we brought this up it took about 15 minutes to resolve. I am maybe being a bit picky but this is a 7* hotel and something we had been looking forward to for a while. Just expected a lot more.","2","2017-05"
"Wow","Been to Dubai stayed at the burj what a fantastic experience from the foyay to the rooms. It's just another world....tbe restaurant suspended above the Arabian gulf is just breath taking.

"Afternoon tea at the skybar","I booked this as a special treat for me and my husband for our honeymoon, booking was quick and simple over the phone which I had made in england before we flew out. We paid the extra for a window seat and it worked out to be a total of £290 for two people. Pricey but so worth it. Our booking was for 4pm and we arrived half an hour early so we can take some pictures around the hotel and have a snoop around.  We went up to the skybar around 3:50pm and was politely greeted by the staff. Our window seat was amazing and there were clear skies, no cloud as there usually is sometimes in dubai. we don't drink so we were given fizzy apple juice with 24karat gold in it!!!!! absolutely loved it. Every course was exquisite the desserts, scones, sandwhiches. Ironically, my husband and I don't drink tea so we opted for the fruit iced tea which tasted like mojitos and a few freshly squeezed juices. If you go try the passionfruit iced tea!!!These were gorgeous . However, I would say that it would be nice if they had more option for non alcoholic mocktails or mojitos. The staff also gave me a red rose as a gift for our honeymoon, such a lovely touch. Great experience, yes it is pricey but worth it if you have a special occasion to celebrate. ","5","2017-05"
"Amazing! Have booked another weeks stay","My family and I stayed here for a week last May/June 2016 and had an amazing time, So much so, that when we got home we booked another weeks stay and can't wait to go again at the end of this month.
The only slight problem we had during our stay, was the service around the terrace wasn't that great at times, on a few occasions when we ordered drinks they never arrived, also they seem to run out of ice boxes to keep your water/drinks in and was given just ice buckets with no lid, so as you can imagine the ice melted super quick, so nothing to keep our drinks cold, also no water sprays were give out. we were never once offered ice pops, even though i asked on a few occasions for my son, but they never arrive, one waiter did give his apologies and say they had ran out, which really isn't good enough. But having said that I'm hoping that these were just teething problems as the terrace had only been open a few days when we arrived.
So on this years holiday I'm hoping the service is as good as it is on the beach, When you go to the beach the service is fabulous, someone is there straight  away helping with towels and umbrellas, your drinks are there within minutes, including cold water sprays, ice pops, nachos etc, etc.......................Perfect! can wait for on holiday! :)","5","2016-06"
"Day Use of a Standard Cabana at the Burj Al Arab","My fiancé and I booked a day at poolside in the Burj Al Arab using one of their standard cabanas which was AED 1800 so about £400. We just wanted to experience the hotel so paid that rather than staying for a night there. We did not regret it. We had a brilliant day which was an unforgettable experience. The close up views of the Burj whilst sunbathing; the use of pools and jacuzzis; and the air conditioned Cabana made it very special. The Cabana came with a fully stocked mini bar which was included in the price (no alcohol but water, fruit juices and fizzy drinks), a flat screen tv and coffee machine. The staff were very attentive and always ensuring you had everything you needed. They offered free miniature smoothes, watermelon and corn on the cob. The food was nice too. My favourite thing about the place was the bar which you could swim up to and have a drink whilst in the water. Very nice touch. I would highly recommend the Cabana to use the pool all day. ","5","2017-05"
"SImply stunning","Extraordinary hotel.  Our room was like a presidential suite anywhere else, and had the best views over Dubai.  The service from the Butler was amazing, and a couple of little niggles like a computer not working were sorted out very quickly and easily.  We didn't have time for a dinner, but we toured the main fish tank restaurant, which was incredible.  A very nice breakfast started our day off well, and of course earlier showing up to the amazing hotel in a Rolls Royce was the icing on the cake.  My only regret was that we had hoped to do the helicopter arrival, but it wasn't operating that week.  A fantastic experience, and one we would repeat again.","5","2017-04"
"Amazing!","Spent a fabulous day on the Terrace at the Burj. Everything from the infinity pool to the tasty lunch served at your sun lounger by super attentive staff was spot on. Finished the day with a cheeky wee cocktail at the swim up bar. Special mention to Sheehan( not sure of spelling) for his great cocktail recommendations and chat!","5","2017-05"
"Lunch  in Second floor restaurant that was just amazing","My friend and I booked a tour that included lunch at the Burg al Arab restaurant in Dubai. This is the very private hotel that looks like a sailboat from a distance.  The lunch buffet was fabulous in every way and the service was excellent.  One of the managers, Binoy Mohandas, went out if his way to ensure our visit was the best. The servers, especially SHEILA also did a superb job. Selections included both Arab and Indian specialties with many accompaniments. Salads, vegetables, forest fruits and breads were all excellent . The dessert table was incredible. Drinks are pricey but our Top of the a world cocktail was amazing.","5","2017-05"
"Beautiful culinary flight","It's one of best experiences i have never tried in my life. You will have your lunch or dinner in 6 different restaurants, one restaurant for each dish. I recommend you to try this experience. the quality of the service and the refinement of each dish will surprise you!","5","2016-06"
"feel like Heaven","Can't Describe my feeling when i am in Burj Al Arab Jumeirah.i feel like i am king of Heaven and sit in my own palace  and look over my whole kingdom from my Bed ...can't express my feeling,food and services is good and view too. First Nepalese in Burj Al Arab...An i found any Nepalese works there and servelike they are my own brother and sister.Great atmosphere love and enjoy in Burj Al Arab.","5","2016-09"
"Excellent Stay But A Few 'Service' Issues","We have stayed at The Burj before and the superb rooms/hotel facilities have only get better. Extra swimming pools/cabana's make this more of a 'resort-type' feeling now and I have to give superb credit to the Cabana Manager/Staff for running the pool/cabana facilities in a most professional way - a credit to the hotel.

Suites are expansive, clean, have every amenity you could ever wish for and housekeeping never miss a single detail - turn-down service is superb too with many little 'gifts' placed strategically for when you return to your room.

Food in Scape is quality and the service in this restaurant is also second-to-none - as you would expect from such a high-quality hotel.

We had a wonderful stay but there are a few service issues that let the hotel down and we really would consider trying another hotel now we have been here twice - simply because of the service issues. These were:

Breakfast - 3 mornings running out of our first 4 mornings here, the breakfast experience was a disaster.  Wait staff are initially very attentive, seating you and asking for your coffee/tea selection, but then it starts to go downhill. Toast appears from nowhere, and undercooked/cold toast at that. They have no toaster for you to make your own toast, so you rely on the waiter to make it and bring it to your table - which varies from 2 minutes to 15 minutes, depending on how busy they are.

For your eggs, you can go to the egg-station and order there and as they ONLY have one Chef on the egg-station, this again can take anything between 2-20 minutes (20 minutes was our final day before we complained).  The Chef in question also could not cook an egg for toffee - our sunny-side up fried eggs were burned and the tank next top us had poached eggs that were not at all poached.  But again, the 'timing' issue of having to wait up to 20 minutes for your eggs and the uncertainty of your toast arriving, means you can never sit down and relax to a 'breakfast' because you are always getting food in dribs/drabs and much of the food goes cold by the time other aspects of your breakfast arrives.  Not a good breakfast experience at all and training/servicing needs to be restructured.  They may even want to 'lose' the buffet breakfast and instead have a breakfast menu which will at least ensure your food arrives at the same time and is fully cooked!

At check-out, the Butler brought the 'extra's' bill and we noticed a sum of money on there which came from the rooms payment.  We had paid in advance and so were surprised to learn of an additional room charge.  The Butler and then the Manager investigated and it turned out that due to exchange rates when we paid in advance, there was a discrepancy in the amount paid.  But this was never communicated to us either before arriving, or when we checked in, it was simply left until our bill was presented and even then not explained until we queried it.  The Manager was superb, sorted it all out for us in 30 minutes and waived the charger - which is all very kind, but it left us in an embarrassing last 30 minutes and we left the Hotel with a bit of a sour taste as this would be our final memories.

On one day, our room was not cleaned even though we were out all day and the DND sign was not on; a simple 'oversight' and the Butlers apologised and we received flowers/wine as a way of apologising, but again, these simple things should not happen in a luxury hotel - we are do not need 'freebies' as a way of saying sorry, we prefer not to have 'issues' in the first place!

I have to give credit across the board to the management that resolved our breakfast and billing issues; they were extremely professional in the way that they handled these matters.

But all told, a luxury room/facility experience but 'Servicing' could have been much better and was a lower standard than we previously experienced.  Still, a great Hotel to try once if you've never been here and rightly or wrongly, it will give you 'thoughts' each and every time you stay in a hotel after staying here - you will always draw a mental comparison and apart from the servicing, most other hotels would come up short when compared to this one; a pure luxury indulgence.

A couple of useful tips; the Wine list in the room is outrageously inflated and you get a better selection at the restaurants for far less.  The coffee machine in the room needs some brief instructions as you have no idea what Capsule 1 is, or Capsule 4 - pure guesswork and 3 is Chocolate (would never have known unless tried it - instructions would have helped).

Highly recommend booking a 'cabana' - superb experience with exceptional service.","4","2017-04"
"Nice hotel","It looks much smaller than in the photo but beautiful tower. There are some restaurants serving non-in house guests! I loved the restaurant on top with an amazing view. However the ones at the lobby are also good! The waiters of the  lobby restaurants are not very friendly, seems to be a bit arrogant!","3","2016-11"
"Iconic legend","1999 is a way back. The year when this masterpiece was build. It is difficult to recognize it in its walls, because of the typical arabic interior style. All nice, shining, gold everywhere. Lobby is one of the kind. So is the view from the top. New system of pool was a necessary update to keep up the pace with new players in the game (Hotel Armani, Versace, Atlantis etc.) which are new, modern and contemporary style, with great location. It was a magic stay, even for one night it is a must for everyone who is a hotel fan in common meaning. Even if this facility, including restaurant, is overpriced like hell !, it has some spark inside the walls. Spark of magnifique Dubai and its legacy to the world - be the best, unique, the dream.","5","2017-05"
"Bling, bling - all the way!","Everyone must stay - even if only for one night! The rooms have wow factor with abundance - you may never want to go out! The new pool & bar/restaurant area is beautiful. This was our second visit & our only moan would be the amount of tourists that are allowed in to take photographs & fill the lifts and not to mention the buses outside the entrance, bringing these tourists - sometimes it is difficult to exit the hotel! However, it is an incredible experience.","4","2017-05"
"Not like i imagined","I didn't stay here however, booked for lunch. wonderful experience and ended up relaxing in there for 4 hours! Quite expensive but worth it as quality and freshness of food was fantastic and desserts were delicious. service was impressive, staff were so attentive. there was live traditional music as background music, this was so entertaining and relaxing and really made you feel you were in Dubai.","5","2017-03"

"Mr","A duplex room makes it very comfortable to hold meetings in the room as well as providing a nice working environment. 

Large windows in each room provide a fascinating view of the sea with spectacular sun sets! 

An excellent and memorable experience! ","5","2017-05"
"Very nice... but nowhere near as nice you'd hope","We were in Dubai for a 5-day stopover on the way from Hong Kong to NYC, and stayed at The Palace Downtown (3 nights), Burj Al Arab (1 night) and Al Maha (1 night).

I am struggling to throw a number rating at this, because it is clearly, objectively, at least an ""excellent"" property, but is not as good as it should be, could be, or thinks it is.

First things first, to be clear, the property is unlike no other, and it was super fun to stay at. It is overly opulent in every sense; a virtual assault to the senses. The lobby and rooms are adorned with gold finishes and regal red drapes, colorful carpets and a general sense of glitz at every turn. 

It's hard to put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit fake, and rich only on the surface. It is like the ideal hotel for Donald Trump, with goofy gold sheets etc.

I will say the bathrooms are great, although we had trouble figuring out the tub and it took a long time to fill.

When we were there the new pool had not yet been opened. The old pool was very underwhelming, as was the lounge area on the grass next to it. I will say the private beach is great, with the view of the Burj Al Arab but not much else.

The staff were friendly and we were well taken care of at check-in. We booked via Virtuoso so were upgraded from a one bedroom to a two bedroom. I believe the next category from a one bedroom is actually a one bedroom panoramic, so this was technically a two category upgrade (although I would have preferred the panoramic since we had absolutely no need for the second bedroom).

The restaurants are very meh and overpriced. The underground one is kind of cool, but it's basically like dining in an aquarium. The one up top has a good view, but again food is nothing to write home about and the decor is...weird.

Stay here if you can spare a couple thousand bucks, want to say you did it, and have a little fun taking pictures in the comically over-sized and decorated rooms. But if you're looking for the ""world's best hotel"" or ""world's most luxurious hotel"" you'll probably be disappointed.","4","2016-06"
"More than I dreamed of...","I didn't know what to expect but this was so much more than I could've imagined. Everything is top level. The service was impressive. It's like they knew us before we even arrived! If you're able to stay or even get a tour of the penthouse, definitely do it. And make a trip up to the bar for a great view and a feeling like you are in one of the greatest hotels in the world (because you are!).","5","2017-01"

"Honeymoon :-)","What's left to say about this hotel? 

It's staggering. 

This is our third visit. This time a night here on arrival on our honeymoon. 

Every single little part of our stay was catered for in the most first class manner it us feeling totally overwhelmed! 

Monika Kopp saw to it that the hotel looked after us, despite not being there herself, she had taken time to arrange everything having met us before at a previous stay and ensured our return was absolutely perfect. Thank you Monika! 

To our Butler, Alum on floor 19. You were an absolute star. Genuinely one of the most impressive members of Jumeirah staff I have ever met in the 20 years I have been visiting the Madinat group since it was built. Thank you for your personal care, attentive nature and above all else making us feel more than welcome back. I'm sure many returning to the hotel take the whole experience for granted but for us you added a gloss and finish to our stay which will remain with us forever. On what is a very special occasion.

I am planning on returning again and will hope that you are still here, or at least running the Hotel! 

To the Burj Al Arab management-I don't often find time to write reviews or give such feedback but please pass on the highest form of praise to Alum. For he made our stay perfect from start to end. 

Thank you

"Ms ","We recently stayed at Burj Al Arab Jumeriad Dubai for 3 nights what a beautiful hotel I am talking about up another level compared with all 5 stars Hotels we have been ! From little thing to big thing I could not say but must see with your own eyes ! 
Let put away how beautiful and quality the Hotel has been builded . 
The service was an Exceptional , friendly helpful kind and always make you smile and feel like you are home ! 
Easy access around the Jumeriah by Buggy , many beautiful restaurants , the beach was beautiful , people come to serve you drinks & finger food of course it's no charged ! Not too busy so we feel like we were in our own World , my daughters had been in so many 5 stars hotels with her parents but she was surprised and smiling all the way with Burj Al Arab ! 
I understand we paid Aud $2900 per  night but it's worth every dollars during our trip ! 
We will definitely stay there again 
We had Dinner  at Al Mahana fine Dinning OMG  the food was delicious and the service was excellent ! We also had afternoon tea at sky View Bar Wow so beautiful view we don't want to leave the place ! Before arrived Dubai , We were in London & Paris ( but there is nothing to compare to Burj Al Arab Dubai is on My number 1 list , in London we paid Aud $1000 per night but room was average Breakfast was so so , Paris a bit nicer and we paid less 😜
Highly recommended Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg surrounding with all high end designers  and close to most restaurants and Of course Burj Al Arab Jumeriad ! We miss Dubai Most 😀😀we already plans to go back to Dubai by March next year LOL

"Fantastic cocktails and a great experience","When we visited the Burj al arab we were greeted with friendly staff. The lobby area is just breathtaking and the aquariums look out of this world. We enjoyed several different cocktails and snacks whilst we sat and enjoyed the views of Dubai from the view point window seating. Dress code is a little more casual than I expected, some people were there in polo t shirts and jeans and vest tops etc. Myself and my husband dressed smartly as did most others. Its expensive but worth every penny for the experience.","5","2016-09"
"Ultimate afternoon tea ","We went to visit Burj al arab during our visit to dubai in March 2017. 

We opted for the ultimate afternoon tea and went to the burj al arab from our hotel Dusit Thani. 

We had made online reservation for the tea directly and the experience was nice. The staff at the welcome gate just saw our online reservation confirmation email on my phone and waved us through. 

We arrived a bit early to enable us to roam around and take a few pictures before we settled at the Sahn Eddar. 

The interior and exterior of the property is really awesome and seeing and exploring it is an experience in itself. 

The lady at the Sahn eddar was very friendly and seated us at an awesome location wherein we could see the approach to the property and also see the jumeriah hotel and beach. 

The ultimate tea experience was awesome and as my family is vegetarian, they prepared veg dishes for us. We spent close to two hours at the lounge and were truly amazed at the hospitality and interiors of the first seven star hotel of the world. ","5","2017-03"
"Like nothing else","Having lived in Dubai for 11 years we thought about we should go and stay... so we did. We've visited many times for various reasons, so we were well prepared for the decor, it is what it is, but the accommodation... nothing can prepare you for. The sheer size of the duplex suite will knock you for six - everything is so clean and perfect, as you'd expect. This is not a cheap place to stay and perfection is fundamental

Aside from the opulence and grandeur, the staff are quite something else. There isn't too much fawning over the guests, though I'm sure that can be turned on should one's ego require it. The staff at every corner couldn't do enough - and so discretely too. 

Getting around the Jumeirah resorts was a breeze, which is important with two young kids in tow. In fact, it was almost impossible to find fault... 

The only thing that we could find, and it's very minor, was the unavailability of one menu item at the very cool and relaxed Scape restaurant. The offending, elusive item? Sweet potato fries. I'd expect a 7 star hotel to be able to find sweet potatoes... a touch disappointing, but ever so minor

Yes it's expensive (but it is good value) - if you can afford it, even once, do it. We'll go again, no question. But next time we may leave the kids at home....","5","2017-04"
"Amazing","I went here for my honey moon. It is a great place to stay perfect for family vacation too. Its view is magical. I love waking then walking out on the pool and looking across the water. There are allot of tourist attractions nearby. I love this place!          P.S. Its worth the money","5","2017-04"
"Didn’t meet our expectations!","We’ve been visited so many high end hotels all over the world - but never been in the only 7 star hotel in the world. Expectations were high in consideration of the prices... The facilities are great without exception. The Suite was great and offered plenty of space. The bed was HEAVEN! Really Heaven -- the best one I’ve ever slept in by far...
The service unfortunately was lacking... Our check in took more than 1,5h... We had just booked for 1 night and thought we could use the beach or the pool on the check in day - but when we have received our key cards - it was already 4:30. The staff was friendly but far away from motivated nor well trained. There was no body-lotion inside the bathroom and staff told us it is only available on request...(??) You can live with that if you are staying at a 4 star Hotel.
The Lobby is crowded with picture making tourists. Either they have to make different entrances or they can not allow people making pictures. 
I also have missed the personal note or the presence of a manager... 
Everything I get as a Platinum Member in Ritz or Marriott by standard. 
The Breakfast was the most disappointing I’ve ever had... The buffet was grazed.... No fresh juice was available... Water we must pay extra for (excuse me?? water?)... We have received 1 piece of butter (maybe 30g) for 4 people... Nobody felt in charge for our table... 3 different kind of cheeses, 2 different kind of smoked fish, 3 different kind of bread -- sounds pretty minimum standard to almost every hotel in the world... After we have left we felt we didn’t get what we have paid for. This hotel still benefits from the good old days and when the service was just brilliant and something which really reflected the Arabic hospitality!","3","2017-04"
"7* Tea Time!!!","When will I ever be at a 7* hotel again so I splurged for afternoon tea!  It was nice to be in the lap of luxury if only for a couple hours! Most of the food was delicious but the scones were NOT like those in Ireland! Lol. Surprisingly full on the seven course ""meal"" of nibbles and treats but so delish!   Goes without saying it was extremely pretentious which I always find annoying but I wanted to see inside so I sucked up the 'looks' and enjoyed my stay!","4","2017-04"

Would definitely recommend.","5","2017-04"
"Seven stars shines bright!!!","Wow. This Is one of the most marvellous hotel I have visited...even though I did not stay as it is very expensive.  To visit the hotel I booked breakfast at the sehn eddar restaurant for myself and wife. Kids under 4 go free. It's a memorable visit for us and we spent ample time inside the hotel and took lots of pictures. 

The entrance is just as good as any other five star hotel. But once you get inside its a total luxury with a difference. Its lobby area is a where from you can see the atrium which is all colourful from bottom to top. There is a fountain in the centre (quite different) flow of water is dancing and jumping in a very smooth and perfect manner. There are escalator on either side of this fountain. 

The escalators reach the first floor of the hotel where some restaurants and shops are located. Sehn eddar is the international cuisine restaurant located on the same floor which I booked for breakfast. The moment I checked in the restaurant the receptionist lady LOTA escorted us to out table which was on the Window side! We loved the sitting arrangements of the hotel. She was very accomodating and made us feel comfortable. 

Then the waiter came to us and served us with his never fading smile. His name was Dominique.  What a lovely charm he has while interacting with us and serving was also as smooth as it can be. I really believe the hotel is as good as the staffs it hires and their behaviour is what makes it truly seven star. We had a very yummy vegeterian breakfast with lots of extras to eat. 

I liked the entire experience I had there with my family and it was worth the money I spent to have such a lovely visit. ","5","2017-04"
"fantastic afternoon tea at the Burj","My trip to Dubai was completed by a visit to Burj al Arab.....from the moment you centre the building, it is wall to wall luxury. The lunch/high tea dining room was on the very top floor and the views were superb! The food was excellent as was the service and as it was a special occasion, the kitchen sent out a 'happy birthday' cake.    A special afternoon, thank you!","5","2016-05"
"1000 and 1 luxury nights :)","This hotel is just a miracle. Not my style, but very impressive. All the rooms are 2 floors have fantastic view and over luxury interior. The most expensive full size cosmetics (Hermes, La Ric..) including perfumes, beautiful accessories. Delicious restaurant it top terrace and great one on ground floor. Many activities (concert hall), nice spa (but not best of Dubai). Very beautiful beach! If your budget is not limited - must have this experience!","5","2016-09"
"A Must Do!","Expensive equates to sheer opulence and luxury from the grand walk up to the Burj Al Arab to the mind-boggling atrium foyer, the synchronised water jets that playfully dance in the fountain ending in a spectacular burst of water and light! Marvel at all the beautiful marble inlay tiles brightly coloured in blues, gold, red and orange as you walk around this luxurious hotel where no expense has been spared!
Number one on my quick visit to Dubai was to indulge myself in the amazing spread that is High Tea at the Sky View Bar on the 27th floor.  I was not disappointed, the finest of everything starting with a glass of Louis Roederer Brut followed by sumptuous unlimited courses of sweet and savoury delights. Service is impeccable and the view.....Impressive! It's an unhurried experience, perfect for celebrating a birthday, anniversary or other special occasion as so many guests do. I don't need any reason...would I go again? Most definitely!","5","2017-04"
"Super luxurious hotel with great views and amazingly big suites","was welcomed at the airport by a very friendly and smiling lady who welcomed me at the Jumeirah lounge and then brought me to the BMW 730Li limousine which was waiting for me. the Indian driver welcomed me with water and a bouquet of flowers and the drive in this luxurious car was very pleasant. The return to the airport was done with the same car, and different driver, but as pleasant as the other one. 
the welcome at the hotel itself was very personalised and i did the checkin in the suite. i booked the Panoramic suite which obviously has amazing views on the beaches down there and the city in the distance. the welcome package and amenities is also wonderful. the suite was extremely spacious on two levels, and i could enjoy the delicious evening cocktails and snacks in the luxury of the jacuzzi! the butlers were nice and professional but forgot to explain how to use the TV and sound in the whole suite properly. 
i had the breakfast in the suite too, facing those views, with the sun facing me, what a delight! on the breakfast menu which was very plentiful, i even had caviar! that's top notch luxury... 
the hotel itself is mainly full of Chinese tourists (70%) and Russians. i also took the chance to enjoy the Terrace, and my own sunbeds in the sun. Again, the staff was very friendly and attentive to details. the pool closes at 6pm which i think is too early. Even the sunset is not complete at that time. 
Overall an excellent hotel with excellent service, which cost so much that you'd better enjoy every second of it. this is exactly what i did! :)","5","2017-04"
"Amazing day","No comment !!!! you get what you pay for. big rooms with balcony, nice bathrooms, great room service and friendly hotel staff. you just want to stay in the room and enjoy it. walking area slso to the mall and some restaurants","5","2017-04"
"Afternoon Tea at the Skyview Var - Simply Amazing","I took my daughter for Afternoon Tea at the Skyview Bar at the Burj Al Arab Hotel recently, and she was just blown away by the whole experience. We were made to feel very welcome and the service throughout was impeccable. The quality of the food and drink was exceptional but its much more than just the tea itself. The atmosphere was superb, and although there were quite a few customers there was an air off peace and tranquillity throughout. Views from the restaurant were great even though we were up on the 27th floor where sometimes the views can be spoils with the heat haze that sometimes descends on tall buildings. We were greeted with a glass of champagne shortly after we took our seats, and the courses were brought out at very acceptable intervals allowing us to take in the flavours and be mesmerised by the way the food was presented. We were celebrating my daughters birthday and towards the end she was presented with a gorgeous chocolate birthday cake and a red rose with the tallest, thickest stem I have every encountered. We didn't think we were going to be able to eat the cake but it was so light and delicious we ate every last crumb! We took the rose back to our hotel room and placed it in a very tall vase and it was still going strong four days later when we left. Although quite an expensive experience I didn't begrudge one single penny just to see the look of sheer delight on my daughters face at every  stage of the afternoon. I am hoping to return to Dubai in November with a friend and I know this will definitely be one of our ""must do`s"". The hotel obviously chooses their staff very carefully and this is evident in the level of service received by guests, please don't change a thing.","5","2017-04"

7 star treatment all the way

The people who stayed smiled at each other knowingly

The shops lovely to look around 

The staff brilliant can't do enough had a cleaner called Muhammad Ali

Try the spa is all I can say and gym is spotless","5","2016-11"
"Over the top, spare-no-expense luxury","As stated elsewhere, this place is the ultimate in Dubai. Security is high just to reach the property. Check-in was smooth, we were met by our 2 butlers- just excellent care from them! Our room was the largest we have ever experienced- see photos. Views of the beaches and city were too cool. Restaurants here were amazing- the Friday brunch is unforgettable. I just cannot stress enough what a memorable experience we had. There are not ample adjectives to describe the royal treatment delivered here.","5","2017-03"
"Fantastic place to stay in Dubai","My wife and I booked tho for October and just the two of us. From the moment we arrived we absolutely could not stop smiling or being stunned by the place.

The staff were so friendly and when we checked into our rooms our jaws literally dropped as our view was of the Burj Al Arab.

Straight down to the pool and beach for cocktails we found our spot and we did not leave the resort at all for a week.

Wild Wadi water park was included and right next to the hotel and this was a brilliant distraction for a few hours a day.

The food was fantastic. The service was 1st class and the setting was so peaceful.

This is the best hotel we have stayed at and I hope to visit again soon with the kids.","5","2016-10"
"High afternoon tea","Expensive BUT worth this once in a lifetime experience. 7 course tea. Excellent service and attention to detail. Superb environment and luxurious surrounding. The toilets were even amazing too. Treated like royalty and it fills you up. Looooved the experience. You need to book in advance to get an access code to show security at the gate to the bridge. You get to walk around the mezzanine floor and browse the shops and peek into the restaurant s. They don't rush you. It was just fabulous. Mezzanine floor booking is more spacious and comfortable than the lobby afternoon tea, if you are paying i would say go for the best!","5","2016-05"
"Breathtaking ","We had booked the champagne afternoon tea ( not cheap). On entering the hotel it takes your breath away the most stunning building I have ever been in. 
The tea is 7 courses and from the moment you arrive you are treated to the most perfect service and stunning perfect food. It can only be describe as an experience. After tea we went up to the gold bar to admire the view but we didn't have a reservation so couldn't have a drink

"The Terrace is a MUST SEE!","Service is unreal!! I absolutely loved going here.. I was here when it was ""THE"" hotel and Dubai was very small but it's still an amazing place of all places to see.. The view, staff, rooms and atmosphere is amazing..","5","2016-06"
"Fantastic place","This is a place everyone have to go. There is nothing like this. Friendly staff, nice place. I want to go there again.
Its expencive but its worth it. We celebrate our wedding day there. I recomand a holliday in Dubai and in Burj Al Arab   ","5","2016-05"
"Steeply Lavish","For my birthday my partner surprised me with a buffet dinner at the Burj. I had wanted to go out to the hotel for a while as it's not everyday you get to experience 7 stars. Although fancy I will say that it was not at all what I expected. Having stayed in a few high end hotels over the years, this one was a little lacking in the facilities, style and comfort department. It also felt like it could do with a good clean, a little grimy and lots of rubbish left behind on tables and even the floor. For the cost I had hoped for something other worldly, but what we got was average at best. The food at the buffet also left me a tad miffed with the quality of ingredients not being very high. In all I would say go expecting a 4 star hotel at best and let them surprise you, that way you won't be disappointed.","3","2017-03"
"The Terrace is a Must - Service is at its highest level - Still the reference in Dubai","We stayed 4 nights in April 2017 - 2 adults and 2 kids (6Y) & (8Y).

We've been welcomed at DXB + nice ride in 7 Series (too small for us 4 I'd say).

Check-In was in-suite and really smooth.

The room was ready with our kid's beds already in the room (you cannot imagine how often it's a struggle to get the beds for your kids arranged).
It was a two floors Panoramic Suite on the 10th floor and it was perfect to fit the 4 of us

As usual but still impressive in the BAA, you receive full sized shampoos - conditioner - Perfume - Body Lotion from Hermes for him and for her. There is also everything you need as tooth brush - water - qtips - ...

Wifi is great. It is free, it is fast enough, it automatically reconnects without confirmation - coverage is good everywhere in the hotel. It's great to have such a Wifi today!

Terrace + Cabana is the greatest addition ever for this magnificent hotel. Infinite pool with sea views and jacuzzis + regular pools. Service was great. Cabana are cool but only if you plan to stay a lot at the swimming pool. Really great!

Butlers were simply perfect : friendly and professionals. Many thanks to all of them.

Cleaning staff was also very friendly and professional.

So, many thanks to all the staff for this wonderful stay, we'll sure stay in BAA again!","5","2017-04"
"Dubai 2017 Vacation","The Burj Al Arab is a beautiful hotel with a spectacular panoramic view of the city line! But, that's just the tip of the iceberg in describing this magnificent specimen. The scenery was breathtaking, the food and drinks were yummy and the atmosphere is to die for. Great place for couples and honeymooners!","5","2017-04"
"A night in the Burj","Recently on a trip to Dubai I found myself having a night of pure luxury staying in the world’s most luxurious hotel, the Burj Al Arab. The building boasts 202 Suites and 9 world class bars and restaurants across 28 double-story floors. It also comprises of a spa, five swimming pools, gym and kids club. All of which is contained on its own personal manmade island.

Below is just a snapshot looking up the interior of the Burj from the ninth floor. From the lobby you can view a magnificent rainbow of colour traveling upwards (the King himself did this). He decided the original all white interior was opposing the luxury experience he was endeavouring to create.

Upon arrival I was greeted by a wonderful member of staff who offered me water and hand towels before taking me up to the ninth floor where my suite would be. Once there I was also introduced to our floor’s Butler (the Butlers are on call 24 hours to bring you anything you need). Then I walked into my suite…

Well where do I even begin?! Sheer opulence and Arabian influence has never been delivered to my eyes before in such a subtle yet chic way. Ones eyes are shifting constantly left and right, up and down, just trying to take in the sheer magnitude of the luxury which has been presented before you. So after a full five minutes of speechlessness while the lady told me all of the features of the room in a voice which my mind had muted and shifted into the background. I had finally come to terms with where I was and what was mine for the night.

I guess I shall start with the entrance. A large door (which is probably bigger than any front door anyone has at home) leads into a spacious marble lobby with a grand living room with a floor to ceiling window in front you. A sweeping blue and gold staircase to the right and a downstairs toilet to the left (yes that’s right my hotel room had a DOWNSTAIRS toilet).

Moving into the living room there is a desk complete with an IMac and a large flatscreen tv housed in a gold plated cylinder. There is also a small bar area and coffee machine hidden in the wall. The living room comes complete with a large upholstered sofa and chaise lounge (both of which were rather comfy). Moving upstairs you first hit a his and hers dressing room complete with gold plated hairdryer on the dressing table (slightly excessive but oh well, when else can you say you’ve used a gold plated hairdryer). Turning left you walk into the upstairs bathroom. Well. It’s roughly the size of most people’s rooms. Covered in mosaic tiles, it gives you a his and her sink, a round jacuzzi bathtub, large shower, toilet, bidet and even a leather upholstered seating area!
 
Turning right at the top of the stairs is where the magic happens. You’ve just entered the bedroom. A huge and may I say comfortable bed if to your right while to your left is a further furnished seating area. But in front of you is again a floor to ceiling window stretching the entire length of the wall with a view out to the main Dubai skyline. The curtains themselves were all electronically operated by a keyboard remote. But my favourite feature of all was the large mirror above the bed.
 
For breakfast we all headed down to the continental breakfast buffet. Well it was a blooming good buffet. Everything I think I could possibly crave at 9am was there. From smoked salmon to doughnuts to fresh chopped fruit and of course a full English. On the downside the service was actually a bit slow and forgetful which isn’t really great at all and in a 7 star hotel. One does not want to be asking for their morning pick me up (latte) more than once to different waiters.

Next came the facilities. I don’t know if most of you know but the Burj has recently had a large attachment added to the rear (and no that’s not an innuendo). This new freestanding area had added two pools. One salt with an infinity view out into the gulf and one chlorinated pool with a bridge passing over it. The area around the salty water pool is covered in sand to create a beach in the ocean if you like. The pool also has a jacuzzi inside and shallow area complete with water sun loungers. Around the pools they also have some very lovely cabanas which guests can hire out. They come in two sizes. The smaller one has a seating area and Bang and Olufsen Tv housed in an air conditioned room with sun loungers sat in front. The larger and more expensive features that along with a balcony, wash area and seating area in front with a retractable electric sunshade over the sun loungers.
 
I very much enjoyed my time at the Burj Al Arab, it’s a building I’ve grown up looking up at while staying at the Mina A Salam – Madinat Jumeirah. But I must ask myself this, is the Burj Al Arab now becoming a bit dated? Yes the new extension has offered guests with a new set of luxury facilities but one must turn their attention to the decoration of the rooms. It may now be time I think that the Burj start channeling some money into remodelling the rooms and giving them a more 2016 look rather than an early naughties one. The rooms are magnificent I can’t deny that and so I leave that question for you to answer.","5","2016-08"
"Cruising from Dubai with MSC","Burj Al Arab,one of, or maybe THE highlight of Dubai. Enjoyed much more Burj Al Arab rather then Burj Khalifa. A very beatifulñ building and a really surprise! We booked a coffee and pastries at the hotel. Luxury and relax in this oasis.","5","2017-02"
"Afternoon Tea","Came here a while ago now for afternoon tea to celebrate a business anniversary. It was one of the most memorable experiences of my life! Everything was so amazing I couldn't take it all in. Food was great, we couldn't finish it all! I loved everything. I would say it has to be done if coming to Dubai, even if it's just once. 
Looking forward to coming here to stay next month (very excited!!). ","5","2016-05"
"Breakfast at Burj al Arab","My wife and I booked for breakfast, as a way to visit Burj al Arab. The food and service were superb, and worth the money (£70 each!). Our host Dominique Macanas then took us, along with three others, on a full tour of the hotel. He was delightful, and the hotel is remarkable.
We were staying at Fairmont the Palm, which was only 25 ADE taxi fare to get to Burj al Arab.","5","2017-03"
"Hype","We've had the experience but see mo reason to do it again. With the prices you'd expect to have serenity but instead you get busses of visitors coming in for lunch and high tea. My advice is to not pay for a room to stay here, instead, book the lunch or tea like everyone else. The tea is splendid.","2","2016-10"
"Relax","We went to the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea , The staff were superb and the food was delicious. The views from the sky view lounge are outstanding. A wonderful atmosphere i will come back , and keep it up team .","5","2017-03"

"Stunning hotel","The 7-star hotel, Burj Al Arab Jumeirah is our highlight to visit Dubai.
The hotel is about 16 years and it is in an excellent condition.
The smallest room starts with suites room.
I like the duplex room and the in-room check in service so we don't need to queue up at reception.
The lobby is stunning. The aquarium wall is so beautiful.
The golden decoration makes it so wonderful hotel.
Nothing to complain to stay here.","5","2016-12"
"Afternoon Tea","We went to the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea for my mum and dad's silver wedding anniversary. The staff were superb and the food was delicious. The views from the sky view lounge are outstanding. Such a lovely venue and excellent experience! ","5","2017-04"
"Avoid....","We live in Dubai for part of the year. We have stayed at the Burj on many occasions. We have friends staying for two weeks in a 2 bed suite with a poolside cabana. If you are used to top quality 5star accommodation think Claridges, Bulgari, Cheval Blanc then avoid!!
 It's a zoo! Lobby is full of day trippers taking photos so you fight through the crowds, the new pool area has been badly paid out, the staff are not trained to the level required, daytime visitors are everywhere so there is no exclusivity. Every time we have stayed there and all of our friends the main conversations with the staff begin ""I am really sorry for this situation.."" ""let me give you some flowers and complimentary champagne.."" by the end of your trip the room is full of flowers and champagne if that gives you a clue. 
The management clearly have no understanding of what is needed to change the situation as it has remained this way for some years.
I have spoken to management about the issues on numerous occasions and they all agree with the comments but nothing changes.
It's a shame that this iconic building doesn't match the hype.","1","2017-04"
"Incredible","Spent a night here at the start of a week in Dubai.  Having been here for dinner 6 years ago it was always a dream to return as a guest.  We had to change dates originally as my daughter was sick but this was no problem to BAA.  When we finally arrived it was just mind blowing.  We were on the 22nd floor and had some great butlers who nothing was too much trouble for. 
They even made 2 little personalised teddies for our 2 children with BAA dressing gowns with their names on.  This was such a great touch and is what really made the experience so amazing.
We used the indoor pool on the first day and this is just such a stunning area to spend a few hours taking in the fantastic views.
The Suite was amazing and so big with amazing amenities in the room.  The only negative about the room was the TV's were quite low tech and need updating.  This is am assured is being looked at. 
All the staff were just amazing and took such interest in our children.  One night my son trapped his finger in the door of the lift and the staff were so helpful and everyone seemed to know and asked how he was.  Just amazing!
We also got a Royal Cabana which again was an incredible experience but would have been better for the price if there was more food brought round to the cabana.
Overall this was just simply amazing and I don't know how anything with ever compare.  It is now my mission to return to this place for a longer stay.","5","2017-04"
"Once in a life time","Well maybe stay twice so you can belive you have been here. Not over rated not under rated but have stayed at others that would come close....but it is special in it's own way and the service can not be faulted.... stay a night if you can.
The rooms are just over the top, great choice of restaurants and a great pool area.","5","2016-08"
"The Most Beautiful city in the world","Dubaï is an incredible city. During my stay, I visited The  Burj Khalifa wich is the tallest towerin te world. I slept in the most luxurious hotel of the city and the staff is fabulous and the rooms are huge. During 5 days , I went to do several activities like shopping because there are so many shops in Dubaï. I recommend you go to The Dubaï Mall. I also did jet ski, a helicopter tour and I took the taxi boats to move me as there is so much traffic and it's so hot for to move by public transport. My BEST Trip !!!!!!","4","2016-07"
"High Tea on top of an iconic building!","Something you might want to experience while in Dubai if only for the views, but you can get even better views of the city by getting to the top of Burj Khalifa. You have to have some kind of reservation to get into the building but if not seeing it from the outside is good enough.","5","2016-11"
"Beautiful views from beach","You can get incredible and spectacular views from Beach of Burj Al Arab a 7- star hotel. Not forget to take perfect shots with Burj Al Arab. Also take fun on public beach near hotel named Jumeriah beach","5","2017-01"
"Opulence!!    Regular ""suites"" are Royal and Presidential!!","This place is over the top!
Service is excellent but you can find excellent service at many 5 star resorts 

The suites are what make this hotel over the top
We had a suite on the 19th floor (1907)
We booked a ""panoramic one bedroom suite""
But it looked and felt like nothing less than a Royal Suite or a Presidential Suite 

Just the entry door was like 8-10 feet tall, looked like the entrance door to a palace bedroom.    
Beyond the door was two walls of glass windows at least 20 feet high.    Views 180 degrees of the city skyline and the ocean. 

2-level suite - downstairs a private bar, 2 living room sitting areas, a large dining room, a large billiards room with full size snooker table, a kitchen and powder room.   Upstairs was the bedroom, another large sitting area overlooking the 20 foot windows, a nice little loft office with 180 views.

What a room for our 18 hour layover.    Oh yeah, and a butler just down the hall available to help with anything.     Room service 30 minutes or less.    Our check in hostess walked us all the way from reception up and checked us in while inside the room before turning us over to our butler.     

Bathrooms are slightly dated but who cares.   Still had everything we needed and more, including huge size Hermes bath products and full size his and hers Hermes cologne and perfume.

Spa was amazing, with rooms overlooking the sea
We had an hour couples massage - awesome 
Infinity pool overlooks the city 

This was an opulent stay, what a cool place!!
I had to attach pix since it was so over the top.","5","2017-04"
"Hmmm","Having been to Dubai on holiday several times we've seen the Burj AL Arab from many vantage points, but this time with my fiftieth birthday fast approaching we decided to splash out on afternoon tea at the Burj! 

It's such an iconic building from the outside, and we'd heard about it's sumptuousness on the inside, but it was more reminiscent of a Vegas casino than we were expecting. 

The lift to the Skyview Bar was great - ears popping and the views over Dubai were stunning. 

I'd read a review which said that seating is on a 'first come - first serve' basis, so as we'd got there early, we had a great window seat with a fab view over the city. The bar itself is a sea of blues & greens and shiny surfaces with a bit of an 80's look & feel. 

We were asked on arrival if it was a special occasion and confirmed the imminent birthday. 

The afternoon tea itself was perfectly acceptable, but lacking in wow factor, although the little birthday cake and presentation of a red rose was a nice touch. 

The waiting staff were lovely, although we felt a little rushed out at the end.

All in all a pleasant experience, and a tick on the bucket list, however not convinced it was  worth the 640 dhs (£140) price tag.

"Never before have you experienced this kind of special!","200 meters above sea level, the glass elevator takes you to the Sky View Bar.  Grab a miniature at the gift store to prove that you were the luck recipient of a grand tour in this spectacular place.  Stay the night and enjoy the great selection of food and spirits.  the views are to die for and will stay permanently engraves in your memory.  A great stay will cost you about $2000 USD, but you only live once!","5","2016-07"
"Is impressive when you see it in person.","I recommend to take the Big Bus tour as you can hop off there and go around.Sometimes the traffic could be very slow due to the fact many people try to go there.You will find a small aquarium that is interesting designed.","5","2016-04"
"The best is still the best","This is one of the most expensive hotel, one of the most luxurious hotel, one of the most famous icon hotel, and one of the most ""VIP"" experience hotel. 

Burj Al Arab is truly an icon for Dubai and it will always remain this way. In Dubai, money can fulfill all your imagination, and this is the same in Burj Al Arab.

When we planned our Dubai trip, I had a little concern about staying at BAA: the price is really expensive and the hotel itself is almost 20 years old. There are lots of new luxury hotels in Dubai with much friendly price tag to choose. However, I feel BAA = Dubai, so I have to give it a try.

We stay in the club suite and it's huge. It has 330 square meter, a pool table, one kitchen, and more than 25 seats available. The room has no sign of wear down nor any kind of smell. The decoration is pure luxury and Arabic style. The room is really quiet with almost 180 degree views.

The moment you arrive the BAA entrance gate, you feel like a VIP: private check in, personal butler service, free to access all Jumeirah property, and one of the most exclusive swimming pool only for the hotel guest and members. 

We enjoy every moment staying at this hotel: living in our fantasy room, walking around in the iconic hotel, taking pictures from all angles outside the hotel, chilling in the pool, sun tanning at the private beach, people watching in the water park, taking rides in the golf cart and boat, daydreaming one day we will be back again.

One of the most precious memory is BAA's butler service. Our butler, Alam, who really makes our entire stay flawless and as smooth as it can get. We are very thankful for everything he has done for us. In addition, we met one of the most friendly golf cart driver, Meseret, she show us different places of Jumeirah property.

Staying at BAA is not just staying in a hotel, it's a lifetime experience. It will fulfill your luxury Dubai fantasy and leave you a lifelong memory. I am not sure we will ever have the budget to come back, but our one night momory in BAA is simply priceless.","5","2017-03"
"2 bedroom suite with Family - huge !","Really liked the opulence of the rooms - they are so huge and all rooms have 2 levels. 

There are two living rooms, a small bar area, a dining room and small kitchen. Butlers are assigned to each room and you have a very personalised service. On one of the days we had in-room breakfast, and it was laid out by staff so beautifully, that you just didn't want to eat it ! Stayed on a half board basis, and enjoyed the exquisite variety of food on offer. Be prepared, it's a 7 star hotel with 7 star prices - e.g. water costs about £10 a bottle from memory. 
To go to the Wild Wadi water park, a cart is available from the hotel and the gold wrist band ensures you get the best service. 
My Mommy mentioned that she enjoyed the daily free Pilates and yoga classes on offer.

Every whim was catered for with just a quick phone call from one of the many phones in the rooms !
My Sister's friend came to visit us, and security is reassuringly robust. Advance notification is given to the hotel and guests must bring their passports before they can enter.

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because of the lacklustre atmosphere - whilst Mommy loved it; it was just too quiet for my siblings and I. The lack of atmosphere, meeting room style silence and general lack of humans when walking anywhere was a bit dreary for me. Perhaps it would suit older couples. I much prefer the Atlantis because it has lots more to do and is very lively comparatively. That said, I'm glad we have experienced the opulence the Burj has on offer.","4","2016-09"
"After noon tea!","My wife and I book table for after noon tea in Nov-16.

"Best Hotel Ever!","We've been to some of the best hotels in the world, but none topped the Burj Al Arab!  From the very first time you see the iconic building, it captures the imagination and makes you feel like you are someplace special.  The rooms are very spacious and well appointed.  The full size Hermes amenities, daily his and her trinkets left on your bed nightly and evening snacks were all part of the nice touches that make this place amazing!  The service is impeccable and the entire staff couldn't be nicer.  Our butlers, Paul and Gaurav anticipated and took care of our every need while we were in town.  The food at all of the restaurants was second to none and the views were unbeatable.  The gym was well appointed and a special surprise for our family was the indoor squash court!  We also walked to the water park (Wild Wadi) which is owned by Jumeirah and free for guests staying at the Burj Al Arab.  This was a nice and convenient family activity.  This place had everything you could want for in a family vacation and we will return again and again!","5","2017-03"

"Scape excels once again but the Burj struggles with its market segments! ","You would expect in the world's only six star hotel, at prices of £1500 a night, to get some privacy. However the hoards (and I mean hoards) of Chinese that they allow in to take photographs (nb not staying at the hotel) means you must unwittingly appear in hundreds of photos a day. Not only that, but the way they ""hunt in packs,"" means navigating the public floors is like the subway in rush hour. So the Burj future targeted market is clear, but I wonder what they think the European segment will do in response. No xenophobia here, but I do like my fellow guests to have some manners and style!!! 
The day is ALWAYS saved however by CYNTHIA and her team at Scape restaurant and bar. Ably supported by Aqueleh, Naleeka, Mercy, Mr Serbia and the highly talented and engaging Chef Timur, these guys save the bacon (no pun intended) for the Burj EVERY time we visit. Oh and Scape is Chinese photo snapper free, thanks to the security staff who do a great job of at least preserving some areas of privacy! 
Be careful what you wish for Burj al Arab!","3","2017-03"
"Afternoon Tea in the Skyview Bar","The best of them all, a one off and worth the experience, a service second to none.
A treat from my daughter, we were lucky to be offered a window table overlooking the sea with the Atlantis in the background and the Burj Khalifa on the far side.  A seven course, a first as afternoon teas go and just the entrance into the place you knew you were in for a treat. After we sat in the foyer as there is a water feature worth watching, and also just the people wandering past, are they also tea guests or from the hotel?
A nice touch was they box your left over cakes up for you to take home as you are too full and as there was a slight mix up and ours were the wrong ones, my daughter emailed them and they not only apologised but sent cakes and pastries out to us with a thank you card.  Amazing service, the best! Thank you to the Burj Al Arab and your lovely staff, from Ms Jemma's mum, a lovely Christmas gift worth the wait.","5","2017-03"

"Best Arabic breakfast brunch in Dubai","Absolutely gorgeous setting. Breathtaking.  Good service. Arabic breakfast was sublime with soft dulcet Arabic tunes played by the band in the background. Highly recommended for family and friends alike.","5","2017-02"
"Afternoon tea","The afternoon tea at the sky view bar is an absolutely amazing experience but was in my opinion overpriced. We paid roughly 300 USD for two and even though the food was good it was nothing special.

The windows were very dirty, which was taking away from the amazing view (understand that the hotel is near the water, but overall it is a 7-star).

The service was great and the food was good, but I was hoping to get something amazing. The hotel is absolutely amazing but the food we got during the afternoon tea was not up to the standards you would expect from one of the best hotels in the world.

I am very glad we experienced it and I could recommend to everyone, but I don't think we will be coming back. Great experience, but maybe my expectations where too high.","4","2017-03"

Our butlers especially Anthony more than catered for our needs and never once did we feel uneasy as can imagine some people may think that. Unpacking was done as was packing for going home which is a great service. We also had wonderful breakfasts each day in Bab Al Yam with the biggest selection of food you could wish for catering for all nationalities. Our heartfelt thanks must go to Nimal, Stephanie and the lovely Louise for all the kindness shown as always.....we are truly spoiled and cannot wait to return in the near future. :) Thank You all","5","2017-03"
"Rude Driver Employee","We dined at one of the restaurants inside Burj Al Arab on Valentines Day. After dinner we went out of the hotel going towards the bridge to take some pictures. Just then a speeding golf cart passed by quickly turning the cart on the hotel facade roundabout almost side-swiping me! My husband shouted at the driver but the driver didnt mind to apologize! The driver had curly black hair, not minding his carelessness. We cant believe such a prestigious hotel could hire such a rude employee!","1","2017-02"
"Lunch","Yes it's expensive, but so good that it is worth going for a once in a lifetime experience. How the other half live!

We went for lunch which was buffet style and as expected exceptionally good. Take the opportunity to look around the hotel as it is fabulous. Huge fish tanks, and I mean huge! Fountains, decor. Superb. Then there's the cars parked outside. 
You cannot get in unless you have a reservation and there is a high minimum spend per person. There is a security checkpoint well away from the hotel itself so if you want to see it other than from a distance get a booking.
Highly recommended.","5","2017-01"
"Be prepared to spend","You can get great views fom Jumeirah beach, but you can only get inside if you have a previous reservation. The most economical way is to reserve afternoon  tea, but this alone will set you back $160 per person. If you want a room, think $2000 per night!","5","2017-03"
"""Mr Aziz Patel""","I recommend Burj Al-Arab to anyone visiting Dubai. Besides the stunning location, opulent interior and breath-taking views inside out, the hotel has true elegance and class without any ostentation. Service is world class as one would expect and always made to feel welcome by the butler and entire team. Suite was incredibly quiet with far-reaching views. The décor of the hotel has unique and exquisite style that one has to experience to appreciate. The dining room is a dream--large, comfortable, with International cuisine and buffet restaurants. The breakfast buffet is a concession to international requirements, but is done better than any I have experienced anywhere! I saw the chef several times checking it. The mocktails are out of this world. Overall, I would say the real jewel of Dubai hotels is Burj Al Arab. Amazing food, superb spa and fitness facilities and great service throughout. Looking forward to returning again.","5","2016-12"
"Wonderful evening!","Went for appetizers & drinks for a friends' birthday. Got the perfect table & sat & enjoyed the beautiful views. Wonderful drinks with very friendly wait staff. A must to see while in the area!!!  We had the appetizer tower where you pick 4 different choices. Had a lot of fun. ","4","2017-03"
"Lunch at Scape","We were with a group of friends and decided to explore Scape at Burj al Arabs new deck. The service was incredible and the ambience was so so relaxing. Food was so fulfilling and cocktails were refreshing. But what made our experience perfect was our server Arden. He is fantastic and pleasant with complete knowledge of his job and is truly an asset to Burj hotel. I highly appreciate his effort to make us enjoy ourselves to the fullest and I felt like he was a part of our group of friends. Keep it up.","5","2017-03"
"Amazing Birthday Celebration","A dream come true to celebrate my birthday at Junsui Restaurant.  It was a memorable experience to dine in this luxurious 7th star Hotel.  Though I lived in this country for 13 years, dining here  is not a practical thing as it is really pricey but with an occasion to celebrate its worth it.   My daughter and I celebrate my birthday.  To complete the occasion a birthday cake were serve complimentary and a rose for the celebrant. How amazing is that some of the staff know how to speak Mandarin to ease up communication as this is a fusion Asian restaurant. A lot of chinese tourist that day and restaurant were busy.  You can spend 2 hours dining and next batch of people comes in next. The culinary team made perfectly each type of food and taste  was excellent. Bravo for the all the staff not just the front of the house but also from the heart of the house.....Service deluxe in details.","5","2016-06"
"Burj Al Arab = Dubai ","This building may not be the latest, tallest, craziest piece of architecture in Dubai, but for me this still stands for what Dubai is trying to be.
It's trying to stand out in so many ways - in some ways it succeeds, in other ways it disappoints, but it always tries hard! 
","5","2017-02"
"BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE, out of taste inside","The Burj Al Arab is without contest the most iconic building in Dubai (at least the first one now there is Burj Khalifa) therefore it became a tourist attraction which is also an hotel? which means it is full of tourist in ""tourist attire....sleepers short and so one...arriving in flocks from buses.."" really annoying when you pay such money for a room or a dinner","4","2017-03"
"Birthday Treat","We arrived st the Burj for my birthday treat as a complete surprise. I was stunned with the experience from then on. Superb facilities, friendly staff and a view to die for.....  I would recommend a visit to the Gold on 27 bar anytime. We will be back, possibly during the daytime. ","5","2017-03"
"Dinner birthday floor 27","We had the wonderful opportunity to have dinner in the restaurant on 27th floor. Booking is essential, and no window seat is guaranteed, but views are spectacular  from everywhere. The food was just incredible, but like any super expensive restaurant, it is not about quanity,(small meals) but the experience in the mouth of flavors. We got the cheapest bottle of wine, around $250 au and there was bottles that cost 4 years of my mortgage!! Still, this is a bucket list experience ticked off.

We missed out on a window, but when they found it was my birthday, we  were moved, which was just wonderful. They even provided the most wonderful birthday cake free of charge.

My tips would be to get there at least 1 hour early to get photos.","5","2017-03"
"Our visit to Burj al Arab Jumeirah","This is the only 7 star hotel in the world.  Unfortunately we could only see from the outside as it needs reservations months ahead at a very expensive rate.  Shaped like a sailing boat & located on the Jumeirah Beach you get a pretty good view from the outside.   Enjoyed the views from outside.","4","2017-02"
"friends  trip","its one of the best trip of my life. amazing place to spend holidays. rooms and marvellous and hotel services one of the best 7 star service, i have ever experienced. luv to go there again and again. hotel welcome is amazing and marvellous. it feel you that you are treated as special guests.","5","2017-03"
"If Liberace, Elvis and Trump built a hotel together...","We expected this place to be over the top and we weren't disappointed.  It is so nouveau riche that it's comical, but in a fun way. It's gold gilt bling and marble everything.  Our suite was something like 1800 sf with two stories.  The staff are falling all over themselves to help you, which is nice to a point, after which we just wanted to be left alone.  One downside is that wherever you go staff are asking you whether you're a guest and to see your room key.  It's very annoying and off-putting.  Our favorite spot was the bar at top, though the food was industrial.  A couple of drinks and appetizers was over $200 USD.

We went for the novelty of the place and got what we expected.  Silly and fun.","4","2017-02"
"Nice Visit","I only came for a drink, I didn't stay at the hotel. It was undoubtably the most expensive drink I've had in my life (equivalent to $50 USD) but still definitely worth the experience. The service is superb.","4","2016-04"
"The most luxurious hotel in the world","Lives up to its tagline. You'll be swathed in gold the moment you enter the hotel. Mind blowing service, decor, food, everything. Have no words to describe the experience. Loved the amazing upholstery in the rooms. Asked for a PS while I was in the jacuzzi. The butler had set it up and kept FIFA ready for me when I stepped out. DAMN. THATS LUXURY. ","5","2016-05"
"JENNY was the best tour guide ever!","9 am came, I was about to cancel the show around from a hangover the previous night at club 360, I went half-heartedly to The Burj Al Arab and Whoa I am glad I did not cancel! I had seen the hotel from outside views the last couple of days, however, I had not been inside.
From the Lobby, Jenny introduced herself and took us to our first stop - Nathan Outlaw's seafood restaurant. Her demeanour exuded professionalism with a warm smile that made me think of her as a friend, because I found myself explaining to her that I was a bit hangover, however I was enjoying every bit of the show around. 
We went","5","2017-03"
"Amazing","4th time visiting Burj Al Arab for the famous friday brunch, and it never fails.
The most Amazing hotel, a wonderful restaurant overlooking the sea, and every kind of 1 class food; lobster, sushi, homemade juices, chocolate fountain and so on. No cheap, but worth every dirham.
We always comes back, and it is a must for us everytime we are in Dubai.","5","2017-02"
"Architecture, Design and Service!","Loved the design and style of the hotel......the suites are huge......the service caring......the views a little hazy......so much to see inside and out.....the interior fountains fascinating to watch.....food was good.

"The best!","This hotel was amazing! We had a minor hiccup regarding check in but the GM was incredible and fixed it right away. Our room was incredible! All blue and gold and beautiful views. The butlers were for the most part very helpful. Loved the Hermes toiletries and the beautiful mosaic bathrooms. The pool was really nice. All the restaurants and room service were always consistently good. All in all, we had a great stay here.","5","2017-01"
"Another wonder of the world..","WOW WOW WOW.. What can I say. This place is so amazing, there are no words to describe the place. Set on an island a short bridge from the shore, the hotel is rates a 7 star resort. You cant even get on the bridge unless you have a reservation at the hotel or the restaurants. We were able to go to the Sky Top Restaurant on the top floor. What a view to Dubai it has. I was speechless. 
Do whatever you can to go visit this resort.","5","2016-05"
"Best Steak we've ever had!","Had to visit this iconic hotel on our trip and ate in Al Muntaha and had drinks in the Sky Bar. We had a Chateaubriand which was carved on marble at our table and it was amazing. Loved the sculpted bread too. It's a stunning building with gold lifts and surprising water fountains. A must see and taste! ","5","2016-04"
"Definition of Luxury","Excellent service and suites. Very helpful and friendly staff. Panoramic Suite was amazing with great views, different but beautiful interior that only this hotel could get away with. Would love to stay again.","5","2017-03"
"Night at the Burj","Had dinner at the Al Muntaha restaurant, the food was first class and the overall service was incredible. 

Totally wonderful evening The wine list was first class and also had drinks in the Sky Bar prior to dinner. This is a must","5","2017-03"
"stay at burj al arab dubai","I is an amazing hotel . service is amazing right from the time  you arrive at the Dubai airport , check in and through out the stay. the hotel is extremely luxurious . amazing views and great restaurants. you have a designated butler and concierge right outside your room. 7* all the way. the only issue is the price. all this comes at a price. if one can afford it , one must visit it. it is a lifetime experience.","5","2017-02"
"A place to experience","The iconic Burj Al Arab is a place beautiful to experience. It's people, the interior and the ambience too. 
The people because they have extended to us a very warmth costumer service, interior is expected as it is, its gold and beautiful collection of colors. The ambiance is great for couples, you have variety of place to sit in, relax and talk.
The food and it's presentation for me is world class.
","5","2017-02"
"5 stars!!!!!!","The minute I walked in I was greeted with a beautiful fountain surrounded with water feature. Everything was very fancy and posh. The room was amazing, well it was more like an apartment! We had a view of the sea and seen the dolphins jumping in the morning. The bathroom and beds felt very clean. The restaurant had an aquarium inside it! While we waited to get served we had sharks and fish to keep us entertained! Would love to go back.","5","2016-03"
"FLAWLESSLY AMAZING conclusion to my 40th birthday celebration in Dubai!","My husband and I went to Dubai to celebrate my 40th birthday and we decided to conclude our week long vacation with a night at the Burj al Arab. This hotel is what dreams are made of!! I mean, seriously, it was an absolute fairytale! The staff bends over backwards to do anything for you!! My computer in my suite wouldn't work and the in-house IT person immediately came to fix it! I had a question about something and called the concierge and they asked if they could come to me to help. Our butler, Hari, was so amazing I literally wanted to bring him back home with us! When it was time to check out I was actually saddened almost to tears! There are so many beautiful and amazing places to travel and I typically don't think of returning to places I've already been as there's so much to see and so little time but the Burj al Arab is enough to make me break that rule!! We will 100% be back to Dubai and to this hotel! Even if you can only stay here for one night it is absolutely worth the stay!!!! It was simply amazing!","5","2017-02"
"Afternoon tea","From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. The surroundings were beautiful, and all the staff were lovely, great service and the food was lovely. We were not hurried, but we were not left waiting between courses either.

It was expensive, but all in all it was a wonderful experience.","5","2017-02"
"Afternoon tea delight!","My fiancé and myself had afternoon tea here. We tried to book the skyhouse tea, but it was completely booked for the day, so definitely book in advance. There were many tea options and we loved the set up! Everything was so elegant and beautiful. There was a great beach view, although the weather was a bit rainy. All in all I would recommend trying it! ","5","2017-02"
"Must see hotel......","Truly amazing hotel, which from the outside has an extraordinary unique and awesome architecture. Inside everything is different, either big or just amazing. Gold is used everywhere, and you look at aquariums when using the stairways from the reception up to first floor. We had drinks, expensive but very good at the cocktail bar. Interesting to see how you can spend a lot of money when sleeping in very nice surroundings.","5","2017-02"
"Great experience but with some issues.","We splashed out on the Sky Dine option which included cocktails in the Skyview bar, a three course meal in the Al Muntaha restaurant and a cocktail in Gold on 27, all being located on the 27 floor of the Burj Al Arab. The cost was 695 dn, approximately £150 per person.
The hotel is stunning, with gold decorations, a huge atrium with fountains and architectural features which amaze.
They make you feel special from the moment you arrive as they accompany you in the glass and gold lift which whisks you up to the 27 floor.
Now for the not so good bit. It may seem picky but for £150 per person I would expect a menu which would include more than three choices per course. To be honest, I had a meal at lunchtime the following day for £15.00 which I enjoyed more. A scallop dish, a chicken dish and a veggie meal as main courses- not a great choice. Also not everyone can afford to choose a premium wine at upwards of £200 per bottle - the sommelier was flummoxed by my request for the cheapest bottle of white wine on the menu, I managed to locate one at about £100 and ordered it through gritted teeth!
The service was personal but they failed to take our order before we had finished our cocktails so we sat without a drink for 15 minutes whilst they prepared our starter before escorting us to our table in the restaurant.
I felt rushed on conclusion of the meal as they ushered us to Gold on 27, where we had a stunning view from our table in the window overlooking the Jumeirah Beach hotel and across to Downtown. We could make out the Burj Khalifa's flashing lights in the distance. The cocktails were great in both Skyview bar and Gold on 27, nicely presented but similar to other venues.
Although I had some issues, only really because the hotel alleges such high standards ""We are a seven stars hotel"", the overall experience was magical and despite the eye watering price was, as a one off, worth it. I gauge my TripAdvisor points on the basis of experience, food and value for money, hence what may appear a low score.","3","2017-02"
"Amazing !","We were invited as part of a dinner, but I heard the place was very expensive. it's worth the price, because no word can describe it. It's just Impressive. We were at the garden, right below the Burj Al Arab Monument, and not only the view is nice, but food was really, really good !","5","2016-04"
"Incredible cocktail and dinner for honeymoon  ","Simply stunning !!

The hotel is out of this world and we didn't even get to see the rooms lol !

We visited for cocktails and dinner 
Do not let the minimum spend put you off its worth every penny !

Excellent service staff are very friendly and you are treated like royalty 

The glass lift going up to the bar made me feel like I was in Charlie and the chocolate factory ;) 

Thank you we hope to return again ","5","2016-08"
"WOW!!! Spectacular and amazing.","When my taxi dropped me off infront of Burj Al Arab, I was gob smacked. It was trully beautiful. It is the only 7* Hotel in the world. The view outside is amazing. jumeirah beach, jumeirah hotel all looks lovely.

Inside is just crazy, I went for lunch and the food was delicious. It was a buffet it was called AL-IWAN.
It is trully wonderfull the whole experience. Every staff member in the hotel were wonderfull.","5","2017-02"
"No Wonder its considered to be the best in the World!","Where do I start with probably the best hotel in the world! 
There is so much good to write but will be better for one to experience themselves but here is a short brief.
From the moment you enter you will blown away by the opulence & sheer grandness.
The fantastic service you will experience from the door to everyone in the hotel is fast class.
The rooms are huge & on a split level with your bedroom upstairs & huge living room downstairs. Plenty of gold all over. 
The amenities in the room are top notch from Hermes, Paris.
Loved the service, the ambience , rooms, beyond words can fully describe.","5","2017-02"
"Even If You ONLY Go Once.....You MUST GO!","This is one of those hotels that even if you can only afford to go once in your life for one night GO!! Very few experience compare to that of staying at the worlds ONLY 7 Star. There is nothing bad to be said about this place. The staff here will literally bend backwards to assure that your stay is nothing short of perfect.","5","2016-10"
"Lunch at the Burji","From the entrance to the restaurants the things you get to see and the service you receive is amazing. We went for lunch buffet and got their a little early so we could walk around the hotel. The service was excellent , we did the buffet lunch and the food amazing & the variety was out of this world . The staff also excellent, from pulling out chairs, to making sure drinks were refilled, offering to take pictures, always smiling. It is worth the money you spend for the experience ","5","2016-12"
"superb restaurant","A great experience to be in this hotel.
Went there for dinner.  Only on Reservation 
It does start with a warm welcome at the entrance .
And the whole stay was perfect.
Excellent cocktails in the Sky bar.","5","2016-05"
"Afternoon Tea - Sahn Eddar","Food was really good but I would like to highlight the warm welcome and great service provided by Shahin.
He was taking care of our table and his attention and care was amazing. I loved it when he realized that me and my best friend were so loving the food service and brought us some extra jelly without we even asking for it. 
I would say service is outstanding and turns the experience into an unforgetable one.","3","2017-02"
"Totally amazing ","We booked into the Burj as a joint valentine/anniversary treat but took the kids along as it's a once in lifetime treat. We definitely weren't disappointed from arrival to departure. We were greeted  outside by a personal assistant who escorted us through to the elevators and up to our room explaining the hotel protocol and answering any questions on the way. We were on floor 21 in a one bed duplex, on each floor there is a butler at a reception that's available anytime. We were shown into our room and shown how to operate the facilities etc. Soon after a trolley was delivered with a cake and some small bites along with a massive bunch of flowers my younger sister had arranged and a bunch of roses from the hotel. The room was as tho would expect, amazing...everything that could have been thought of, was. The view, the cleanliness, the complimentary items and the comfort was exceptional. We booked for dinner in the bab al yam restaurant and to be honest I was disappointed in there. Again the service was exceptional nothing was to much trouble, we had some confusion over the booking and there wasn't a table ready for us, (upon departure I received another bunch of beautiful roses as way of apology for the confusion). The choice was very limited and basic and nothing that made me think wow, couldn't really find anything I wanted to eat.... (I'm not a fussy eater at all), I don't eat fish or beef so I opted for pasta and sauce and some chicken from the grill station, there wasn't anything for kids, another customer informed us if we asked they would bring nuggets and fries which they did. We had 4 pepsis, in a normal Pepsi can.... 2 kids and 2 adults and the bill was just short of £310, staggering really, I was surprised there was no reduction for kids (over 4) I'm sure other parents must feel the same, there's no way kids eat a fraction of what adults eat so to be charged the same price is just ludicrous. The beds were uber comfy and we all had a great sleep, and in the morning  we headed down to the same restaurant for breakfast (there or an arabic breakfast) that was good, everything you'd expect on an international breakfast. Check out was fast and straight forward, checking out with the reception on your floor, you can have you luggage taken for you to the door and then our car was swiftly brought to us from valet parking. The weather was horrendous with rain and wind, Friday the outside pools were closed due to sand blowing around and Saturday it was to cold to use the pool, one was still being cleaned, I would have like to have been offered a complimentary day pass to use the pool at a different time, (great for us as we live down the road) I know it's an act of nature and it can't be helped but that was a highlight especially for our children and we couldn't utilise them. We could also use the wild wadi water park, but with the same problem, it was bad weather with rain on and off. There no way on earth that you could ever fault the service or standards, amazing experience and one we won't forget in a hurry. ","5","2017-02"
"World class irreproachable service!","I had a business dinner with a colleague last November. The aura was great and the service is just excellent. The food was great and personnel very gentle. I liked the background music and the lights.","5","2016-11"
"Birthday in the Burj","My Fiancée and I stayed at the Burj al Arab in Feb last year for his birthday, it was truely once of the best experiences of my life. I burst into tears as i was shown into the room, very overwhelming! We were treated like royalty, I received two bunches of flowers and it wasn't even my birthday! I'd highly recommend the culinary flight experience it was unbelievable. If I could give 10 stars I would 👌Hope to come back soon.","5","2016-03"
"Best Experience, International Culinary flight lunch","Booked International Culinary flight and was a fantastic experience, the stewardess cant do more, they are just the best professionals and obviously I have no words to describe the hotel it self, it is self explanatory :)

I am sorry for this very delayed review which is well deserved, I visited on the 10/08/2016","5","2016-08"
"Loved it!","I had to stay for one night not in my apartment in Dubai, so I started choosing hotels and of course my first choice was the incredible Burj. I always wanted to go there, but I didn't have an opportunity. I made my reservation through the official jumeirah website and it was done in few minutes. I came there with my two kids and the only word that came to my mind was ""wow"". The first thing that I noticed was that the security is very strict. No one can come to the hotel, only if you have a confirmed reservation there or if you are staying there. We didn't have to stay in the lobby the staff immediately showed us to our room and made check-in in the room. We had our own butler that helped us with any of our questions. The room had two floors and because I have small children they called and engineer and in an hour later after the check-in they made a safe fence so that my children wouldn't fall from the stairs. We ordered room service and it was quite nice. I really liked the 'paklava' dessert. Also they came with a big Thomas train filled with chocolates and treats and my elder kid could choose anything in any quantity free of charge. My boy was very happy. In the morning we visited pool with sea water and it was amazing and the view was great. The check-out was also done in the room. I had an incredible experience and I wish I will stay there again soon.","5","2017-01"
"The only 7 Star Hotel in the World","This is only Seven Star in the World, which needs no introduction. Must watch the Sea view from its hanging Restaurants.Ideally located on the Arabian SEA  beach.","5",
"Nothing 7 star about the service!!","Bitterly disappointed after our visit tonight. Extremely rude and arrogant hostess in Al Mahara. Total chaos around the check-in desk for access to the Skyview bar. We got engaged in this hotel with a private dining room in Al Mahara in 2014 and had a totally different experience. At that time, we received warm and genuine greetings and the food was superb. Unfortunately, it was like we were visiting a different hotel tonight. Absolutely nothing 7 star about the service and appalling attitude of the hostess. We have guests in town and feel mortified at having built this place up to be something spectacular. It was utterly appalling and we will be lodging a formal complaint. Don't waste your time or money visiting this overrated hotel. Nothing like it used to be!","1","2017-02"
"Under review ","I am currently staying at this hotel and I will review further at the end of my trip, however up until now I must say that things haven't gone too well.
My wife and two children arrived 3 days before me, we had made arrangements for the hotel to collect them at the airport, we stated that there would be four people and luggage, the hotel sent one car that couldn't take the luggage, this had to follow on in a taxi.
Three days later I was arriving with 5 more children, due to the previous problem I e-mailed with very specific instructions about my numbers and luggage requirements, I was told that I would be collected at the airport.
We we arrived I was searching for a sign with my name on to no avail, after 20 minutes I asked the help desk to call the hotel, the hotel informed me that I should go to The Jemeirah desk and we would be looked after there.( this wasn't communicated in the e-mail)
Myself and my children were then taken outside to two vehicles (my e-mail said ""two vehicles AND a luggage van)
After forcing all of our luggage into these vehicles, along with my children, and as we were about to set off we were told that we ""were in the wrong vehicles"", these were for a party going to The Jemeirah beach, not The Burj Al Arab !
Everybody out( at 3am!) and all of the luggage, 5 children and 7 bags without any offer of help to find our other vehicles, quite ridiculous.

First day at the hotel has proved to be satisfactory, most of the staff are pleasant.

Last night we went for dinner to the restaurant ""Scape"" we were a party of 11 and even though the main restaurant was quiet they sat us next to the kitchen and toilets, making it convenient for the staff,even so, the service was average at best, there didn't appear to be anyone in control,it was certainly not a restaurant experience that you would remember, more like a cafe,we were in and out in one hour and went to The Atlantis for ice cream for some atmosphere! 
Breakfast this morning is no better, staff consistently talking amongst themselves, you have to interrupt them if you want anything, just not what you would expect from this establishment.
Whenever possible I prefer to compliment rather than criticise, it's just not what it's billed up to be.
Overall, up until now, this experience is not what I had hoped for, I will post a further review at the end of my stay.
Maybe one more week or sooner if things don't improve.","3","2017-02"
"Awesome place ","A very good good place to visit. It was so long. I never seen this such kind of architecture. It was a marvelous piece of engineering. When you go to dubai visit it for fun. A awesome place to go with family or u can go with ur wife too","5","2017-02"
"World's finest!","I visited the Burj Al Arab with my mum for a day filled with sun, spa treatments and great food. Staff were 1st class and so helpful and polite at any encounter. We booked in for a full body massage which was perfect, the best I've ever had. We also went for a swim and the pool looked out over the ocean. We had fresh fruit and herbal tea. 
After a blissful day we had reservation in the junsui restaurant and the variety of the food was just as impressive as the culinary skill required to prepare such an amazing dining experience. 
I would recommend this to anyone to just take the time and visit. 
A beautiful location, exemplary staff and the height of luxury!","5","2016-09"
"Amazing Hotel","Burj Al Arab should be your first or second place in Dubai. the location at Jumeriah. they have perfect streets, atmosphere, clean places and ofcourse perfect view for the photos. you can share amazing feelings to your friends when you visit there. it is 20 minutes away from dubai mall and burj khalifa by car.","5","2017-02"
"last night of honeymoon treated like a king","Finally get to write this review, I'd been dreaming of going to this hotel for a few years now and decided to save it for the last night of our honeymoon. 

We were collected from the hotel by rolls Royce and driven to the hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted with coffee, hand towels and dates. After that we were shown to the suite and greeted by the butlers. They unpacked the cases and showed us around the suite. The suite itself is pretty amazing. spread over 2 floors it is very luxurious. In the bathroom there are his and hers hermes products which alone would cost a lot. the view was good we had a view facing Burj khalifa in the distance 

We went for the dream package, which included breakfast and dinner, transfers and some treatments at the spa. 

I think although quite expensive was a better value for money than buying all of these separately. 

Everywhere you go in this hotel the staff treat you like royalty. It did not seem like anything was too much trouble. They  open your suite door, carry your breakfast to the table, unpack your bags, call the lift for you everything. You barely do anything yourself. 

We also enjoyed the close proximity to the madinat and beach hotel. We went for a walk around the different hotels and it was really handy because they have a little buggy that takes you between them all. 

The breakfast was good and is the only place in the world where I've seen a chocolate fountain...also spotted a TV star sitting next to us. Dinner we ate in the Arabian buffet in the lobby. Highly recommended and can't wait to go there for dinner again next time we are in Dubai. We also had the afternoon tea in the sky Delete repeated word bar. It is 7 courses of pure heaven and you will be extremely full. 

Go and experience this wonderful hotel. The only negative I would say is that it's hard to distinguish between actual guests and ""tourists"" coming for lunch here. Kind of felt like a tourist attraction when it's supposed to be the most exclusive hotel in the world.","5","2017-02"
"Afternoon tea in the clouds","Afternoon tea in the Sky View bar is an amazing experience, from the moment entering the hotel it is pure luxury. With a window seat looking over Jumeria beach it's a superb setting to enjoy the 7 course afternoon tea package.  Each course is excellently presented and the staff are extremely curtious and proffesional. The afternoon tea package is quite expensive but I think it was throughly worth it and an afternoon I will never forget. Thank you to all the staff for making it so special.","5","2017-02"
"Amazing","I absolutely love this hotel. I booked the skyview afternoon tea as a surprise 40th birthday for my boyfriend. It was very emotional driving up to the private island. We got there about 45 mins early and had a look around the place. Staff were very attentive and always smiling. When i told them my boyfriend does not like fish, they changed the sandwiches for him. Worth paying just to go inside and for the experience","5","2017-02"
"You pay the price, you may get in!","We were there for the Skyview High Tea. We got there pretty early, they ask for the reservation at the security post 100 m from the hotel.
I've expected mucg more glamour, but it was pretty down to earth. Nice lobby, aquariums, flowers, very nice first impression. 
They let you walk around, take fotos, no problems there. Plenty of seats to use while waiting for your reservation.
Review for Skyview bar follows separately","5","2017-01"
"Fantastic afternoon tea","I booked afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab for our 27th Wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. The setting is superb with wonderful views across the city and the Palm, the service by Marky was excellent and the food, which there was an abundance off, was sublime. 

I couldn't recommend it enough for a special occasion as you come away feeling rather special and very full. 

Thanks for a great afternoon!!","5","2017-02"
"Out of this world!","Visited the hotel with my family for a sunday brunch on our Dubai trip back in November 2015. 
From the greeting on the entrance gate to the welcome by the staff in the hotel entrance, everything was from another world before it even started! The interior of the hotel is very surrealistic and with a lot of gold.
The service in the restaurant is extraordinary! The waiters are treating you like a king. The food is very fresh and from a high quality! Sleeping in this hotel must be a dream!","5","2016-03"
"Out of this world","Amazing...we were greeted at the front door by numerous members of staff, from the chauffeur that drove us to the hotel to our butler to the restaurant staff all amazing!! It really is the most luxurious hotel in the world. Out of this world, amazing view from the hotel room, amazing decor Nd facilities. I could not fault this hotel. You also get to go to the water park as part of the package which is great for kids and adults. Excellent hotel and service.","5","2016-08"
"High Tea","This was my first trip across the Atlantic. The experience was exhilirating! The tradition of High Tea was a foreign experience to me and I quickly grew accustomed to its serene elegance. I highly recommend this regal hotel, especially for this experience.","5","2017-01"
"Brunching as it should be","We went for brunch whilst the husbands took the kids to wild wadi!
This whole experience was amazing, from being welcomed in at the gate, to entering the hotel! They had all the christmas decorations up and we took the esclator up past the full sized aquarium. 
We were early for our reservation but were allowed to wonder round the hotel and everything was so lovely and welcoming.
We went down to the terrace for brunch and we sat outside. The terrace is very new and gives great views of the coast and all the boats cruising past.

 We were given a choice of the special offers on alcohol which was nice as alcohol is expensive anywhere in UAE.
Inside the choice of food was amazing, and there was also the choice of having food freshly cooked, and no hanging around waiting, it was then brought to our table.
We spend the entire 4 hours taking our time, drinking wine, chatting and enjoying our lunch, and not once did we feel rushed or made to feel that we should be leaving. 
Eventually it got too hot for our Scottish complexions and asked to be moved inside and even that was not a problem. 
The food was excellent quality and had everything from fresh fruit, fresh breads, to little individual desserts, there was a good choice of wine and the whole experience was worth the final bill.

This is not a cheap hotel or experience but we did not regret treating ourselves to this at all and there is offers to be had if you look for them.

I would recommend this to any group of girls that want a wee treat on their holidays and who love nice food an gorgeous surroundings.","5","2016-12"
"Wow *****","Was treated to drinks in the sky bar. What an experience. Words cannot say how impressive this hotel is- super amazing. The decor, the layout, the staff and the cleanliness us unbelievable. 
The experience starts when you drive up and give your name if the booking then it's a dream from there. The drinks are out of this world, especially a glass of vintage Dom Perignon! I would advise anyone who goes to Dubai to go a treat.","5","2017-01"
"Futuristic architecture","It is one of the most iconic buildings in Dubai, a city full of examples of futuristic architecture: almost a symbol of Dubai, as much as the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. There are spots where photo opportunities to visualize this building, where tourists congregate to look. Only guests of the hotel are allowed to go in the hotel, understandably so. ","5","2017-01"
"An Icon in the Middle East","This is my first visit to Dubai and I was determined to stay at The Burj. On arrival, I was amazed at how many Chinese people were in the lobby, taking pictures but our 'personal receptionist' soon whisked us past them and up to the 12th floor to meet the floor Butler, Kelly. He was charming and showed us around our suite. The suite is a duplex on 2 levels and depending on your tastes, it is fabulous or gaudy.......As a friend who has stayed here says, 'it's a mix up of Liberace & Versace'. He wasn't wrong. Gold and blue everywhere. Telephones at every turn. Butler service in command. This place is super-expensive but you are treated to cleanliness that had no limits, security like a rock star, food that melts and for such a large hotel, friendliness. I was surprised at paying £60 for a small glass of wine but there you go......!!! All in all, The Burj has it. The hotel structure defies belief. Does it deserve 7 ⭐️? You decide.","5","2017-01"
"Old Hotel, but Beyond Expectation of a 7 Stars Hotel!","From the moment you enter, you will be blown away with the architecture, Colors, Design & Hospitality. 

I wasn't lucky enough to be a hotel resident, but I was invited few times for conferences hosted over there ...

and I tried to sneak around just to check it out, as I heard a lot about it before being there. 

To be honest nothing much to write here, as you can't describe the fascination you feel when you are there ...

But try to have the High tea .. of course, its pricey .. but it's an experience. 

Once again, See you in another review around the world. 

Peace.

"How the other half lives","Attended Burj al Arab 27/01/2017 as part of guided tour party. I looked at the dress code as I only had casual holiday clothes. My wife and I went to the 27th floor Skybar with others. We were treated very well by all staff. I was surprised to see a man wearing jeans and trainers in the bar. This was against the dress code. Possibly a result of money over style winning over.","5","2017-01"
"Afternoon tea","Amazing. I dont think i will ever be lucky enough to stay in this hotel but to visit and have afternoon tea was fantastic. The hotel is everything you would have imagined and more. The service was impecable and the food lovely. I really loved the oppertunity to visit and dine. Next time i will try the evening meal. Looking forward to that already. ","5","2017-01"
"Mind blowing","This place was mind blowing from the moment you drove in. Once you get to the gate you give them your booking code and go on through, the cars parked out the front where amazing. When you enter the building you are blown away with the aquarium an the fountains, you dont get splashed and the aquarium is pristinely clean. Going up the escalator to the gold lifts and having staff press the buttons for you, then getting to the restaurant and sitting having a drink looking back at the city. words can not discribe the grandeur of this place a must see.","5","2016-02"
"Beautiful building","We had high tea in the restaurant, did not stay in the hotel. Tea service was good, nothing different then the usual you would expect.  The views are beautiful and the building itself is fantastic.  A truly unique but expensive experience.","5","2017-01"
"Amazing luxury","This hotel is absolutely stellar. Expensive, but worth every penny. The service is memorable and the location is just unbeatable. Everything you want from a real 7 star. and the rooms will take your breath away. Every detail is well thought through.","5","2017-01"
"A perfect end to our honeymoon ","Me and my husband (eeek still feels amazing to type that) visited the Burj Al Arab for a gorgeous 2 nights on our honeymoon. Previously staying at the fantastic Jumeirah Zabeel Saray we decided to book 2 nights of ""celebrity luxury"" before we returned home. 

An ordinary family, no riches and diamonds we actually fell extremely lucky when booking The Burj Al Arab and got a great deal! Still very expensive for 2 nights and not anything we could normally afford to spend but seeing as it was our honeymoon the once in a lifetime experience we just thought what the hell! 

Throughout our booking any queries help or advice we needed the amazing Kunal Chand replied back to every one of my emails quickly, effectly and always resolved any queries I did have. For example straighteners arnt normally apart of the room however I requested to have some before arriving as I wanted my hair to look nice for our swanky meal at the Al Mahara. Upon arrival I had straighteners in my room. It's the little things you know! 

The hotel itself is immaculate and breathtaking in every way you turn, we got picked up from our previous hotel in a rolls Royce and we're chauffeured to the burj al arab. I was given a gorgeous bouquet of colourful roses and upon arrival we had the hotel manager greet us and 3 members of staff offering refreshments. It really was a celebrity feel! 

Going up to our room 1404 on the 14th floor we met with two of the most lovely, smiley kind and helpful floor receptionists. Every time we exited the lift one of them would open our suite door immediately and greet us with a bow. I wish I knew their names as I would love to give them great credit but hopefully the hotel have their names on the system we stayed 7-9th December 2016. These two member of staff are a credit to your hotel. 

The suite itself was mind blowing! Their was pillars in the room created with gold leaf! A hugeeeeee floor to ceiling and room width window overlooking the ocean and the Jumeirah beach, we had chocolates and biscuits in our room and roses on our bed. 

The pool area was to die for, a real sense of true relaxation calm collected and immaculate the infity pool delivers such views of breathtaking memories. The staff were always so helpful offering drinks and refreshing towels. 

Now.. what were all waiting for.. THE FOOD! 

Now I must admit I am not a big fishy eater I wouldn't try anything I didn't no off and wouldn't buy fish to cook at home. I'll eat mussels at a restaurant and king prawns that's about it. But... the Al Mahara WOW. Truley breathtaking, like nothing you've seen before! Enetering the restaurant is like going down under the sea into some sort of movie! You take a golden lift down and enter into a beautiful under the sea filled fantasty! With subdued lighting glistening decoration and impeccable sea life we felt so spoilt! We sat down to a glass of wine and nibbles and waited for our table but we didn't know the staff were waiting for us to tell them we're ready haha! So 20 mins after our reservation and another glass of wine we went to enjoy our meal. 

We indulged in the 6 course chefs reccomendation as included in our stay. Normally nothing on this menu would i ever contemplate eating I didn't know what half the stuff was! But I thought hey your at a 7 star hotel in a Michelin restaurant just eat it and see what happenes. I wasn't going to start asking for alternatives in that much of prestigious restaurant. Our waitress was lovely I don't no her name either but she was white with an accent short dark hair shirt like ear cut stylish like Rihanna. 

She served us more wine upon request (wine very expensive £140 a bottle!) worth it though you have to look and act the part ha ha! And then came our food. They were small but amazing taste! It was like brill with cucumber tuna steak I think we had lobster and crab linguine which was to die for cod (this was the main and I didn't care for it as I hate cod so I left that) oysters cavier and sticky toffee pudding. I can't tell you have amazing the food was, pure flavour expertise cooking and timing and just incredible memories. I would happily pay the price itself to have that meal again I've never experienced anything like it!  Massive compliments to the chefs! 

The whole stay was amazing every night we had our butler knock and he delivered sweet treats, ran our bath and we had gifts left on our bed each night too! Full size Hermes ammentities in the bathroom including fragrance which smelt beautiful and fresh flowers. 

I would DEFINITELY stay over again, I do think it probably is over priced maybe if you were one of the people who can really afford it and you had no care for overs concerns and you could boss people about to change that food get me that drink and money wasn't a an issue you wouldn't see it that way. But for £1000's per night there wasn't much of a huge difference in quest quality and importance of how the other Jumeirah hotels treat you. 

I do want to thank all the staff for a memorable stay and for being so kind to us. It was a perfect honeymoon. And your pool bar  magheritta pizza was the nicest pizza I've ever tasted! 

Thank you!

"Afternoon Tea","To be honest not that impressive from the self rated 7*hotel.
Service was slow, food items took long in coming out.
The sandwiches, sweets were very ordinary. The scones were the only saving grace with the right accompaniments.
Breakfast tea came with hot milk and no tea strainer.
Oh well, an experience is an experience.","2","2017-01"
"excellent staff , great hotel","we have stayed here a couple of times now and the quality and standard of staff and service is 2nd to none. Even the GM came to the pool bar to meet some guests which was a nice touch. especially in a suit when its hot.

would highly recommend and although its slightly expensive , its not much more than most other places in dubai. great value for money. Top quality","5","2017-01"
"Perfect meal !!","Reserved for a meal in the top level restaurant it was amazing, nice food with great views. The structure and interior of this hotel is breathtaking and so luxuriours. Truly deserves to be known as 7 star hotel!!","5","2016-04"
"Amazing","I was fortunate enough to be taken to this hotel for 5 days prior to a flight to Mauritius by my parents. This is by far the most breath taking and impressive hotel I have ever stayed at as you'd expect. Upon arrival we were given champagne and hot towels etc, the enterance is enormous, with impressive fountains, gold esculators and a huge hollow structure. The service and facilities were also the best I have experienced, although if you aren't used to 24/7 butler and maid service as we were not, it can be a little distracting and uncomfortable having someone stand in 45degree sunlight to hold an umbrella over you and open every door for you. The room was gigantic, two floors of gold plated decor, amazing panoramic views and the best bed with mirrored ceilling I have seen.

If you are able to I'd fully recommend staying at this hotel or even visiting for drinks just to experience the decor etc. Although I wouldn't advise a lengthy visit unless you are used to this level of hospitality 24/7.","5","2016-02"
"Bab Al Yam","Thank you to Meric , assistant outlet manager, and Chef Suleiman for the outstanding service and the kindest treatment at the Bab Al Yam restaurant, you make each visit wonderful and unforgettable! All the food is absolutely delicious!","5","2017-01"
"Gold on 27","Visited gold on 27 for some drinks whilst on a holiday in Dubai. 

Visited at night time which wasn't great for any view. You have to reserve tables next to the window, this was a little disappointing. 

Had the ""Sun down"" menu which included two cocktails and one dish for 250aed. Food was good however when ordering the second cocktail the waitress explained that they had run out of that particular cocktail, meaning we had to order a cocktail we didn't actually enjoy or even drink!!

Walked around after our drinks and got to see inside the burj which was great! 

It was a great experience to have and the staff were welcoming and friendly! 

I guess it would be better to visit during the day where I'm sure the views would be spectacular!","3","2017-01"
"yogeshwar amatya","what an excellent example of a hotel, can't wait to enjoy it again

both my wife and i enjoyed the pampering we received in this beautiful hotel

babal yam, the skyview bar, and junsui were both excellent and so were the other restaurants 

the chefs, waiters, captains at both the bab al yam and the skyview bar were extremely friendly and made every visit worth the while

enjoyed 5 nights in this lovely hotel

found the butlers and the house keeping staff very professional, polite, and ever ready to assist

the suite was very, very, comfy and welcoming 

we were met  y s lovely lady during our check in, who was extra warm and helpful 

highly recommend

"Different Class","We had a 5 night stay in what can only be described as a amazing stay. This is our 2nd stay. And our experience was 1st class. The new North deck is a wonderful addition and the pool.will amaze you. The service was out of this world. There are no words to describe our incredible experience. The hotel is less exclusive now and there is more people about than there was during our 1st visit in 2005. But that's not a failing,  just an observation. ","5","2016-10"
"Honeymoon treat","Actually went in December 2015. 

This is the height of opulence. The grand entrance and the exclusivity of this place make it something of an attraction. We went for high tea at around dusk and the views were breathtaking. 

The service was top notch and catered for all needs. The one issue I had and I am only saying this because it is a 5 star plus hotel is that we told them my wife does not eat beef but they still brought out beef sandwiches for one of the courses. This sort of attention to detail is what you would expect at a hotel of this calibre. 

Would do this again for a special occasion. Worth doing at least once if you are a regular to Dubai. ","4","2016-12"
"That 7 Stars Really are Well Earned.","One of the Most Exclusive hotels in the world of course have one of the most exclusive restaurants globally.

The El Muntaha Restaurant , has a wonderful view to the palm and a wonderful cuisine. 
If you go to Dubai you should visit this restaurant. 

Of course you have to make a reservation in advance, which is very easy just sending a email or calling to make the reservation in the front desk of your hotel.","5","2016-11"
"Well Worth A Visit.","While on holiday popped into the Burj Al Arab and had a good wander about went out onto the outside platform and my goodness what a Fantastic  view if you get the chance please go to the outside platform and see for yourself the Fantastic view`s.","5","2017-01"
"Afternoon tea","Lovely afternoon tea with lots of delicious cakes and treats. The first 4 courses are very filling so make sure you save space for the treats that come round. Hot chocolate was the best ever. We went for the champagne afternoon tea with included one glass and unlimited soft drinks. 
This was a birthday treat and was a lovely touch to bring out a cake and for the musicians to play happy birthday. 
Tip - get there around 4ish as you will get to see the views in the day and the fire tunnels at dusk.
Downfall - service is slow!","4","2016-09"
"Luxurious Splurge Well Worth the Money","Our wedding anniversary was fast approaching and I needed to plan something fast. I found the best deal on the hotels website. Be warned, this is a 7 star Hotel, and the price reflects such. For about 2 grand a night you can get your own personal butler, in-room check-in, and just about anything you can possibly imagine. The rooms are all 2-stories, boasting the grandest staircase. There is a security camera outside of your room, which is accessible by remote from anywhere in the room. The remote also controls there features such as lighting, tv, and music. The decor throughout was nothing less than perfect. Touches of gold trim ran throughout the modernly decorated room. There's plenty of space to host a gathering or perfect for just relaxing. Although there is plenty of room for children, I do suggest adults experience this hotel alone if possible. Theres is so much to appreciate and take in. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you want/need for nothing. We made reservations for dinner(included in the selected package), and after our butler ran a bubble bath in our jacuzzi. Yes, the butler ran the bath! The rooms are fitted with Hermès amenities, and even include a bottle of His/Her cologne as a keepsake. The hotel knew we were celebrating our anniversary, so took the extra initiative to provide wine, a cake, card, and roses at just about every turn. Seriously, I left the hotel with over 2 dozen! We did opt for massages, and the Rolls Royce pick-up from Abu Dhabi, both being extra of course. In total we paid about 3k USD for the night. I have no complaints, and lots of memories. Money well spent.","5","2016-06"
"Afternoon Tea - Amazing","We didn't stay at the hotel, but did do Afternoon Tea. It was over the top in all of the good ways - it was very ""Dubai"". The food was legitimately delicious, the staff was very friendly and the views were stunning. If you do tea and aren't staying at the hotel arrive a little bit early so you can explore the lobby, it's amazing.

The hotel is a bit outside of Downtown, but not to far. Afternoon tea is expensive (~$160 USD / pp), but if you can swing it, I'd recommend the splurge.","5","2016-12"
"Highlight of a very memorable adventure","I visited Dubai last year and chose to stay at the Burj Al Arab for one day of a five day stop. It was... unforgettable. For a lover of luxury and experiences, that one night equaled the rest of the nights spent in Dubai as well as the time in the Maldives after. There has never been a place where I've felt so catered to, so regal, so royal. From the moment we landed and were picked up by a white Rolls Royce, I knew this would be something special. The car happened to be playing ""Champagne Life"", which we thought was fitting for the experience. Arriving felt like we were literally special honored guests. The door greeter knew our names and even our preferences (apparently they had taken note of nuances during our flight on Emirates, such as my friend's love of Red Bull). They greeted us with a bowl of dates, red bull for my friend, and the first of our many butlers. We were taken up into a room which can only be described as truly breathtaking. Spanning two floors, with ceiling to floor windows on each, it was everything you could possibly want -- done in the most absurd and fancy way. It was Donald Trump decorating a room. All the  bathroom amenities were D'Hermes -- which is apparently expensive since my friend had a minor panic attack, there was gold trim on everything, but it was also surprisingly modern. The entire room could be controlled for sound, lighting, etc. Honestly, we walked around that room taking it all in for a few hours before we had the courage to head out into the midday Dubai heat (not as bad as we thought). All in all I think we paid about 7-15k for the one night including Butler tips (few hundred dollars), car service, underwater dinner, skytop lunch, and a night out in an underground night club. Note, don't expect sanity when purchasing anything in the hotel. I purchased a t-shirt that I needed for my suit and it was around 650D which is   nearly 200 dollars! An interesting side-effect of staying here was when we went to a night club. We were skipped to the front of the line and given bottles of Dom Perignon and Belvedere (served by a guy in a monkey mask). All in all, one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life.","5","2016-05"
"OTT","There is nothing that has not been said about this plush establishment. It lives up to its 7 star rating in every way but especially on cost which is enough to make your teeth itch.
It is just one of those things that has to be done irrespective of having to remortgage the house.","5","2017-01"
"Just arrived","This place is Amazing. I'm here for my companies and so unfortunately to work. But I will take some more days and stay. We arrive today. 15 hours from Los Angeles and we Jet here and than went directly to Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel. They are so nice in this hotel. It's the second time I come here and they gave me the same suit of the other year.
Can't wait now to go to the beautiful beach of the hotel and relax until tomorrow that I'll start working.
Thanks a lot for your great kindness as usual you reserve for all your guests. 
Best regards

"Best of Dubai","Our stay at the Burj Al Arab will definitely be an experience I will never forget.  From the beginning to the end.  True Arabian luxury.

The pick up at the Airport with red roses and a most friendly and happy chauffeur driving a Rolls Royce after a 14 hour flight and news that my luggage had been left behind by the airline in NYC  lifted my spirits and returned a smile to my face .  He said ""no worries you have just arrived to the place where you have the biggest shopping mall in the world!  

The welcome at the hotel was just as happy and easy amidst of the buzzing lobby .  Inmmediatly the hotel took over the lost luggage dilema and made it seem like a easy task, delegating the situation to our personal butlers  which are stationed at our floor 24 hours a day which to me was the most significant asset to our stay at the Burj Al Arab.  Knowledgeable , friendly and competent, Sanjay , Malfred and Karan  seemed like old friends by the end of our stay.

The room impecable luxury .  Not one detail was missing.  The view!  My goodness what a view !  The restaurants were 5 star and options unlimited.  Service to match.   My favorite was dinner at arabian restaurant Al Iwan at second level lobby.  Even if it was a buffet it was luxurious and elegant with  a wide variety of the most exquisite  tastes of Arabian cousine.  Should not miss!   

The pool area and ESCAPE are simple and perfect with a most cozy and special atmosphere.  Felt intimate for such a large place. We enjoyed the most amazing and romantic sunset from the infinity pool.

If you like to walk or jog like I do, I strongly recommend taking a stroll across the bridge and along the coast to both extremes of the Jumeraih property area where you can enjoy views from the Marina, the city and the beach.  

I will always remember our stay at the Burj Al Arab  as one of the highlights of our first visit to Dubai.  Simply  the BEST OF THE BEST .

"Iconic, statuesque, stunning","The Burj al Arab was definitely a highlight of our stay in Dubai. We stayed for two nights, experienced the expansive rooms (all two level suites) and amazing service and attention to detail. There really was nothing wrong at all with our stay - it was wonderful. We toured the entire hotel, and although I was fascinated with the structure of the hotel, I was not fascinated by the decor of the interior at all. It was way too much for my personal taste. The colors, the furnishings all need an update. Seems that they haven't really connected with the majority of hotels in that sense. The opulence and grandeur of ""more"" is still not to their favor in the decor category. I think it needs help in uplifting and bringing the interior to modern day color palette and liking of a general mass population that visits. 
One of the other wonderful features is the new pool deck. WOW! Amazing expansive deck featuring different levels, and to think that it was all imported from Finland! It is very impressive, with plenty of cabanas, space for restaurants and pools at different levels. One of my favorite decks ever!
The Burj is most definitely an experience to be had! The structure is beyond amazing!","5","2016-11"

"Unforgettable stay at the world best luxury hotel","Burj Al Arab is a class of its own relative to the other international top 5 stars hotel. This property is the most luxurious hotel I have ever stay at. I have quite a number of high-end hotel stays over the years but this experience is unlike any others I had so far. I had enjoyed every moment of it during my entire stay there.

First of all, this is a private property where you have to pass a security check-in gate before you can be allowed to enter the hotel. At the hotel entrance, the staff greets you by your personal name the moment you step off the car, hand over a warm towel to clean your hands and then escort you to your private room for the check-in. I passed by the grand lobby and was blown away at the majestic design of the lobby architecture. Upon entering the floor where the room is at, I was check in by a personal receptionist and joined by my personal butler (Bashir). Apparently, there is a personal receptionist situated on every floor of this amazing hotel to attend to your need. The check-out process was quick and courteous, and afterward my butler gave me a grand tour of the hotel room and its many high-tech features, including an Apple MAC for personal use during the stay. The room itself is a spacious 1800 sq ft duplex level suite with a staircase separating living room and the bedroom. The decoration in the whole suite was very detail and memorable. I had to thanks Bashir for his impeccable services and attending to all my needs during the stay.

During the stay, I had experienced the amazing afternoon tea in the Skyview bar, it is pricey but is worth it for the experience of a unique setting soaring at hundreds of meters above sea level and overseeing the Arab gulf. At the end of it, the waiter surprised us with a nicely complemented decorate chocolate cake to celebrate our anniversary there. We went to our room to rest for a bit before heading off to their world renowned Talise SPA, the atmosphere, staff attitudes and the services provided was flawlessly perfect. At dinner, I had wanted to try their infamous Al Mahara restaurant but it was closed for renovation during our stay. We end up with a special romantic package dinner at ground level looking out at the Arabian Gulf. I had to give special thanks to Meric (restaurant manager) for arranging an unforgivable romantic dining setting celebrating our anniversary there. The 5 courses meal prepared by the head chef seems like it comes from a Michelin star restaurant, both food and services were really excellent. And once again the team at Burj Al Arab surprised us with another special cake. Next morning I had gone for a swim at their impressive Terrance pool, it is a gigantic 828 square meters infinity pool that appears to seamlessly blend with the sea. I will let the pictures do the justice.

All in all, I had the most unforgettable experiences at Burj Al Arab, it truly lives up to its name as the world only 7 stars hotel.","5","2016-09"
"Amazing hotel","This is the world finest hotel with amazing architecture and views all around. The experience was like none other.  In day time a lot of tourists just stop here to see the hotel. I believe this is one of the finest manmade structures in UAE.","5","2016-12"
"Beautiful","This towering sail-like building is amazing to look at. A must see when in Dubai. Not to mention that the best spot is in the nearby beach area. You may join a hop-on hop-off bus to visit the beach and get the panoramic view of this hotel.","5","2016-02"
"Great Stay Ever","We really enjoy our stay in Burj Al Arab, It was luxurious, everything so impressive and very good service. Awesome beds, restaurants with exotic foods that give a great taste to your palate, restaurants and suites under water. Beautiful places where you can take the best selfies ever.","5","2016-03"

"Dining Experience at 7 Star Hotel","I'm having 4 courses dinner in Nathan Out Al Mahara on 1st November. The way of reservation is very convenient & easy to be found in the internet. I booked for the 4 courses dinner & the reservation staff was quite detail. The reservation clerk was asking for my special food requirement/allergic. But when I received the reservation e-mail, I found the wrong written name. I also requested for table nearby the aquarium, but the answer given made me not sure whether I could get the particular table or not.

When arrived at Burj al Arab's gate I only need to presented my reservation e-mail to the security. I arrived at Burj al Arab's lobby entrance and the bellman greeted me. I just walking upstairs because I was not sure about where's Nathan Outlaw al Mahara. I saw a beautiful fountain and I arrived on the upstairs floor with some restaurants & luxury stores. I feel quite lost there because I need to ask few staffs around to find Nathan Outlaw al Mahara.

Finally, I found Nathan Outlaw al Mahara and the reception lady was very ready, fast, & helpful. She asked me if I want to have a drink first before I go to the restaurant. But still she didn't mentioned about my table request. So, I asked her about the availability of the table nearby the aquarium. She said that it will be depend on the availability because a lot of guest that also requesting for the same thing. So I still feel not sure that they will granted my request. After that she escorted me to the lift. The lift going downstairs to the main part of the restaurant.

When I arrived downstairs, there are 2 receptionists there & they greeted me with my name. One staff approached me & asked if I would like to have a drink first outside. I tried the mocktail and Germany beer, it was nice.

After the drink served, I went inside the restaurant. They seated me, I feel quiet dissapointed because I got a table but it's not the table that I requested. But eventually I sat there & enjoying the food.

I really love the Aquarium in front of me and I'm still waiting for them to move me to the seat in front of the aquarium. The lady that serving us was so knowledgeable & looks friendly. The food presentation and taste are awesome & fresh. After the main course finished & asking for moving, then only I could move to the table that I wanted.","3","2016-11"
"Two Nights Only","Since 2008 we have enjoyed many many wonderful times at the iconic 7* Burj Al Arab and this being our second stay and seventeenth Jumeirah holiday we were looking forward to celebrating another special birthday. Rochi, Chef Anand and his staff were very attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed our Arabian lunch at Al Iwan which made us feel special. The lobster, crab and lamb was fantastic and we enjoyed the dips too. Lorna extended a warm welcome when we arrived for dinner at the newly opened Nathan Outlaw at Al Mahara and kindly showed us around this stunning restaurant with fabulous bar and octopus lighting before drinks on the terrace. She also ensured we were well looked after during the amazing 4 course meal, our wine was topped up perfectly and the service was just fantastic. We always love watching the fish which is so calming and relaxing. Brilliant evening and looking forward to another when we return to Dubai in February. 

The Asian buffet at Junsui is also one of our favourites and certainly did not disappoint. It has everything from sushi to freshly cooked stir fry, soups, fab desserts, buzzing atmosphere and warm friendly service. Looking forward to cocktails at the new Gold Bar but quickly left after 5 minutes due to the heavy smokers which is allowed and a huge disappointment to see this happening INSIDE the Burj Al Arab. 

Days spent on the new terrace was so relaxing, perfect pool temperatures with the life guard pressing the bubbles button. The heavy imported sand is like sugar and is easy to brush off unlike fine. I felt the sun loungers were a little close together and wouldn't want to be there when its busy.  However, pool staff were attentive and friendly and we were very happy to be there.  The Spa on the 18th floor always takes my breath away as I feel like I'm floating in the clouds which I just love and the views - truly stunning. 

Bad Al Yam breakfast was disappointing on the first morning as we were informed AFTER we had eaten we could have ordered pork bacon which takes 15-20mins from the main kitchen. I requested this which was served the following day with a sausage that I did not order, however it was nice to have breakfast served on a plate and not have to go the buffet. Next time I will tell them not to over season with salt and pepper.  

Sadly we felt the Burj cut backs, with lack of Hermes, standard 4* towelling slippers, unnamed bath salts, instead of Hermes bath cubes, no body lotion or after shave balm, silk stain remover sachet instead of something nice on the pillow at night.  Turn down at 17hrs on the second night while we were trying to get ready for dinner triggered me to say something as I didn't want to spoil my special stay. It was all later rectified with red rose petals in the bath room, luxury Burj slippers, flip flops, Hermes, His n Hers lip balm. Sadly when we got home we discovered His lip balm had been opened and used so I immediately emailed Housekeeping with a photo as I did not want another quest to experience this but sadly I have not received a reply. I requested to see Manager Scott Murray, but informed it was his ""day off"" !!!  Enjoyed our time despite a few minor problems, and not recognised as a 17th repeat Jumeirah guest, it should have been perfect - but Burj will always remain special in my heart.","4","2016-12"
"wonderful---no words","Our first stay at the Burj - and it was just as fabulous as the last time we stayed a few years ago. We especially liked getting tea/coffee whenever we liked from the butler (for free), the Hermes full-sized bottles in the bathrooms, the Evian sprays by the pool..etc","5","2016-11"
"Birthday celebration","We visit Al Muntaha restaurant on December 8th and it  was wonderful and pleasure to celebrate my birthday . We had lovely time and enjoyed our dinner they brought birthday cake to us. staff were very friendly and professional ... excellent environment ..as we expected we were treated very well and friendly ... thank you Al Muntaha Team ... for sure we will b back ....","5","2016-12"
"Complete Reversal Here Since Previous Stay","We returned here on the advice of a friend who suggested we try the place again and many of the original quirks highlighted in my previous review remain, but both the hard-scape (assets) of the service assets (people) have improved markedly.

Service is much better, more complete - and the staff see each little detail you wish for, through to completion. That alone would be enough to shower the place with praise this time, but the hard-scape, most notably the addition on an enormous new pool/spa/restaurant superstructure (like a custom bolt-on cruise ship, by the sea) have completely turned this hotel around.  Restaurants run better, housekeeping runs better, concierge runs better, ""virtually everything"" runs better than the last time we stayed here.

The town here has changed along with the hotel and in future (when ""Mall of the World"" opens nearby) there will be few locations as singularly good as this.  In the mean time, you are staying on an island of tranquility insulated by your room key from a sea of people for whom a view of the Dubai-mall fountains during a shoulder-to-shoulder sweat swapping circus, is a once in a lifetime religious experience.  

You're special here because no rooms cost less than several thousand a night.  There are no ""points"" or ""sales"" ..  if you stayed here, you paid dearly..  Thousands a night - and that willingness buys you a little bit of peace and quiet and ridiculous service and attention, in a crazy-busy town.

When you build an amazing architectural hotel and you thump your chest about being the world's only 7 star property,  and the place doesn't quite work you have one of 2 choices:  You can either fall on your marketing sword, fail and have people ridicule you for it,  or you can dust yourself off, roll up your sleeves and double-down on repairing shortcomings and everything that doesn't work.

The owners of Burj Al Arab are to be commended for choosing the latter, changing management, and trying so hard to deliver on their dream.  As repeat visitor with a front-row seat to the before and after, I can see it is working and I will be back to spend it up again, on a vacation of the future.","5","2016-12"
"HOLIDAY AFTERNOON TEA","My wife and I celebrated the start of our holidays with an exquisite afternoon tea at the lounge at Burj Al Arab. We have lived in Dubai 18 years and experienced afternoon teas at 5* hotels many of which have let standards slip. This was our first tea at Burj Al Arab. Wow we were blown away with amazing service and a great selection of food which was tasteful and sufficient. ","5","2016-12"
"Muntaha restaurant","Amazing location and views but not fantastic.
Food beautifully presented but the main course (duck) was hard work.
I had to ask for a sharper knife and it was not a great help.
Service was good but a bit spooky as both in the restaurant and bar, staff came from behind me out of a blind spot so the first you know is when an arm comes across in front of you.
Will still visit again as it is still very good.
Weather tip: This was my 4th or 5th visit and it is always freezing.","4","2016-12"
"Indescribably Fabulous","This has to be the most luxurious, fabulous and exquisite hotel in the world. The decor is unusual, but it is beautiful. They have great security. All vehicles are stopped so that the people inside can confirm they have a reservation for the bars or restaurants, or if they are a guest at the hotel. The rooms come with full time butlers. They do everything for you, including pushing the elevator button for you. They give you free happy hour treats every evening. There were complimentary cookies, fruit and a newspaper each day. I do think that Gold on 27 is a bit overrated. I ordered beef satay with peanut butter sauce. The satay did not taste like satay, it was served lukewarm, and it was very bland. The peanut sauce was even worse. I also was not impressed with the breakfast buffet. However,this did not diminish any of the positive aspects or features of the hotel. My two room suite was probably 1200 square feet, It had a full bathroom and a powder room. My bedroom was on the 2nd floor. There was a huge bathtub and a shower with several jets. The Hermes amenities are full size, and you can get a new set of all of them each day during your stay. My bed was a double bed, but it was sooooo comfortable. I was soooo pampered and spoiled rotten. I didn't want to leave. When I arranged for check out I told the reception representative that I was going to stay at the Sofitel Hotel Downtown. They arranged to have a driver take my friend and me there in one of their BMWs, complimentary, of course. This has to be the best hotel in the world, and I have stayed at some of the best. There is no comparison.","5","2016-12"
"Simpy amazing","I went to lunch with my family when we were visiting Dubai. The interior, exterior and the view are simply breathtaking! I ate oysters and I highly recommend them to anyone who goes there. It was also a huge plus that they made a cake for my sister when they found out it was her birthday!","5","2016-07"
"Best hotel i have ever visited ","Stayed there for a night and that was one of the best day i had. One of my dream hotel and it was amazing. Loved the place so much. The suite was amazing with 2 floors. Large bed room, mirrored ceilings, best view & luxurious bathroom. Food is delicious.. staff is so friendly. Went to the wild wadi water park next day. We hired a babysitter for my 8 months old baby from the hotel and she was good. Less rides in the water park than the atlantis hotel water park. Enjoyed everything in the hotel. Pool is one of the best place. Spent our whole evening there. Best best hotel i visited so far.  ","5","2016-11"
"Sail-shaped silhouette glorifying in all its beauty","Located in Dubai's premier beach area, it is one of the region's most famous tourist landmarks.The hotels atrium lobby is the tallest in the world.
The Burj Al Arab sets a new standard for hospitality including an underwater aquarium restaurant  and the famous helipad that has hosted numerous celebrity stunts. 
The interior has a soft, warm and sensuous glow throughout .
This hotel offers opulence in everything , from interiors , to food, to services, to accomodation.","4","2016-10"
"Amazing unique experience if you can afford it !","Stayed at the Burj for five nights. Incredible building and amazing suites with superlative service.  Al Muntaha modern european restaurant near top of the building was superb as was the ground floor buffet. Awesome outdoor swimming pools and ""sandy"" beach area. Exceptional staff throughout. One does not stay or eat in a hotel such as this if one has to watch the pennies. Wonderful venue for special occasions such as honeymoon or anniversary.","5","2016-11"
"High Tea is a must","My wife and I booked high tea at the Skyview Bar for the 4:00pm sitting
Don’t forget to tell your driver that you have a pass or he will try and drop you at the front security gate and not the hotel door, you will need to show your pass to security
Once you arrive at the front entrance you are escorted inside and offered hot towels to wash your face and hands, you are then taken to the rear of the lobby to a private waiting area
Between 4 and 6 people at a time are allowed in the lift that takes you to the Skyview Bar, once there you are greeted with a smile and shown to you table
One of the servers explained the format of the afternoon tea and offered us a glass of champagne or non-alcoholic sparkling wine which contained edible gold leaf, we choose the sparkling wine which was delightful
You can have as much as you like to eat (just check the menu provided) plus soft drinks, tea and coffee but if you want any alcoholic drinks then these are extra and very expensive
The views are fantastic but can be a little hazy at times, the staff are only too willing to assist with photographs so don’t forget your camera
The whole experience is expensive but worth it, once we had finished we spent 20/30 minutes looking around the hotel lobby which has 2 large fish tanks by the side of each escalator
There are plenty of taxis/limos outside to take you back to your hotel and back to normal life, it was great","5","2016-12"
"No booking no access","Went for the breakfast. Was amazing food and exceptional service. Was a bit confusing to enter though as even though we had a booking our name wasn't on the door. Got in eventually but that was the only down side. One day I'll stay in the hotel.... when I can afford it. Will never forget how good the breakfast was though. ","4","2016-12"
"Lunch","Lunch consisted of a salad, foie gras, duck confe, and a fabulous birthday cake decorated with gold filigree,it was absolutely to die for. Service was awesome ! The view from the dining room was breathtaking, you can see the man made islands like Al Jermeria.","5","2016-06"

overall its the best place to stay in jumeira group","5","2016-10"
"Icon place to visit ","As you all know, Dubai has this building in its recognition. You  will find awesome service with premium quality. Hotel has specific restrictions for the reservation. You can enjoy gallery for sightseeing and evening in the lobby and gallery. Room service is very pleasant.","5","2016-08"
"No Cash No Access","This 'old' seven stars hotel in not really accessible to everyone.
The rule is clear, show the money and you'll go in if not just pass your way.
But I still get in for a drink and the view.
Everything in this hotel is just out of time and a lot artificial, but isn't it the case in the hole city?
I haven's stay in one of their suite, but I believe that the service is of high quality.","3","2016-12"
"A below average experience","As I had Sirius points to use, I decided to redeem some of them for a stay at The Burj with a friend, as she was moving back to the UK. 

Check-in time is supposed to be 3pm. We arrived at 2.45pm and were told by a very surly and unhappy lady that the room would be about an hour. Not the best start, but what could we do. The room was ready earlier than the hour we were told, and the unhappy lady took us to our suite. She made no effort to make conversation or smile and made us feel like we were an inconvenience.

We were introduced to our butler, Tareq, who was an absolute pleasure and took the best care of us. We are pretty low maintenance guests and didn't really need anything from him, but he was always around if we did.

We went to the restaurant lobby bar on the first floor for a drink and something to eat. We ordered calamari as a snack, and when it arrived not only did it look like heavily battered onion rings, but it was rock hard and very tough. It tasted old and had obviously been sitting in a fryer for a while as the basket indentations were imprinted into the batter. It was inedible. We asked the waiter to take it back and to please provide feedback to the chef. This was meant in a constructive way, as it's a fair assessment and an easy fix. He insisted on bringing another one yet seemed too fearful to give the feedback. We didn't want another one yet he kept insisting as this is obviously what he had been trained to do, rather than just listen and understand our comments.

In the evening we ordered room service which took a very long time and when it arrived, it was decidedly average. Notwithstanding the fact it is room service, and has to travel from the kitchen to the room, it was very poor quality, the napkin was stained with red wine (not ours), the cutlery wasn't very clean and it is hard to believe that this is the quality control in a self-appointed 7 star hotel.

My friend mentioned that maybe we were being treated 'slightly differently' because I was redeeming points. The fact I have spent so much money on Jumeirah properties is how I have the points to redeem, therefore making me a loyal client.

The rest of the stay was uneventful and underwhelming. The suites are tired, the decor in the hotel needs a makeover and all is not what it seems. 

The terrace and infinity pool is absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately, the pool is much too cold to swim in. Not a soul was in the pool, yet everyone was huddled in the jacuzzi as it was the only bearable temperature.

I can understand why people are bowled over by it as it stands on a reputation of 7-star luxury, yet I can honestly say I have had better service, facilities, and food in other properties possessing fewer stars. 

Sadly, it was an average experience and not one I would rush to repeat. Being the equivalent of AED10,000 per night, it was definitely not worth it.","4","2016-11"
"Great experience...","For hotel aficionados like myself, Burj Al Arab is a MUST GO experience...
Is it all I expected? Not quiet...
As a 1999 hotel I think that rooms should begin to be renovated. 
Staff should be impeccable, was not.
Restaurants could improve quality or reduce price.
Nevertheless, is an outstanding place to stay... Pools and private beach are outstanding and infinity pool has the most amazing Jacuzzi and the architectural is innovative even after all those years.
If you have the opportunity, do not miss it!","4","2016-12"
"Incredible experience... ","It was always dream to stay in the Burj Al Arab. Famous for being one of the 3 - 7 star hotels in the world. The service indeed is outstanding. Every wish is taken care of. The rooms are huge and over two floors. Very special the amazing pool. I can't wait to return soon.","5","2016-12"
"What a treat! Fabulous hotel ","Absolutely great hotel- customer service was brilliant from the moment we got picked up from the airport where they presented me with flowers! The hotel itself is amazing and the decor is lovely! The staffs customer service skills were What made this hotel so lovely to stay in. The swimming pool is lovely and food was delicious.
This is one of those places that is a 'must see' in your life, although more expensive it is honestly worth every penny!!!! 
","5","2016-11"
"Even the best drop the ball","Ever since it was built, I wanted to try it out.  As we were in Dubai on a cruise ship, I asked the Concierge at the Ship to make a lunch reservation for us.  Armed with the E-Mail confirmation we made the $50 taxi ride to the hotel only to find the hotel's system had cancelled us out.  No explanation, no excuses, just shoulder shrugs and a couldn't care less attitude.  Not only were we rejected, we were demeaned as 'chancers' hoping to get a meal without booking.  What was really annoying was the Maitre d's questioning whether we could afford the 175GBP per head lunch!  We would have hardly have wasted 4 hours of our holiday and a taxi ride had that been an issue.  So, the place looked different, in my view somewhat over the top, but that's what many locals like.  Personally, I'll not bother going back, since for all it's 7 stars, it still has much to learn about common courtesies.","2","2016-11"
"Hotel good but staff not up to scratch","Visited on an excursion to the Skyview bar ,which unlike rest of the hotel we saw was quite dark inside with views difficult  to see Our representative said we could take pictures of the view from the larger windows at the far end of the bar When we did this we were rudely told by female bar manager that we were disturbing other guests As we were not talking loudly and had only been there a few minutes we were very angry at being made to feel inferior to rest of guests perhaps a customer service training course is required .Rest of the bar staff were very helpful but this incident ruined the evening for us and we would not wish to return","3","2016-11"
"Splendid Hotel in the Dubai","Burj Al Arab hotel is one best hotel in Dubai. This hotel lobby is amazing it's a 22 carat gold plated. And In this hotel have separate floor have own restaurant. Top floor have a skyveiw bar . Inside bar looks luxurious bar in Dubai","5","2016-01"
"Afternoon Tea","Had afternoon tea here to celebrate my fiancée's birthday and this place definitely lives up to its reputation!! Food was wonderful, service was amazing and the views were out of this world, especially as the sun was setting. We did have a 2 hour slot but we were not rushed to leave after this point, with staff even helping us to take photos. A little on the pricey side but would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something a bit special! ","5","2016-11"
"Burj al Arab","Had afternoon tea first before going up to the sky view bar for cocktails. 
Absolutely brilliant the afternoon tea was superb with 7 courses of sandwiches, cakes, scones and patisseries and a choice of teas and coffees. 
Could not eat or that was served even though they were small they were delicious and of superb taste and great service. 
The sky view bar was great its own direct lift from 1st floor to the 24th with stunning views of Dubai, a lovely setting and a wide choice of cocktails and drinks but be prepared not cheap but worth it for the experience. ","5","2016-11"
"Breathtakingly beautiful with unbelievable service","This is by far the best hotel in the world. The rooms are double level, the ground floor has a huge living area with dining table and desk. The beautiful golden banistered staircase leads you up to the second level where you will find the cosiest bed with mirrored ceiling, a huge hot tub bath and shower big enough for a party. 

The rooms are just the beginning! The outside pool area is the best in Dubai with an incredible infinity pool and luxury beds to lay around on. Cocktails are beautifully made by attentive staff and the pool food is simple yet delicious. 

The views from the bars and restaurants are stunning, the food is mouthwatering and wine list is extensive. 

The spa is jaw dropping! There is an option to privately hire the pool for a romantic moonlight swim. Do this! They cover the water in rose petals and pour you champagne while you float around. Beautiful, tasteful and very romantic! 

The staff are very tentative and always go the extra mile. Yes it's extremely expensive but what do you expect in Dubai? 

Book it and enjoy the time. Our stay there will go down as one of the best things we have ever experienced <3 ","5","2016-11"
"Heaven on earth","Best 7 star hotel ever seen in my life. On the top floor a drink is served in gold bowl as a token. The Drink costs around 28,000 Dhiram. Speciality of the Drink is that you get a gold bowl as a gift in which it's served and the one orders the Drink his/her name is entered in the Guinness Book of World Records. Most expensive drink.The most over the top amazing hotel in the world. Rooms are stunning like having your own apartment over two floors. Sky bar is a must. Great views, drinks and food","5","2016-03"

"A dream come true","I had the chance to eat at Burj Al Arab restaurant. It's one of the best fine dining restaurants in the world. A dinner for two costs around 1100 AED. It was an amazing experience. Guests enter the hotel through the mesmerizing atrium, complete with a fountain, escalator, and a clear view of some of the hotel's rooms outlined in varying shades of blue and green. service is one of the best i ever had!","5","2016-11"
"Nice B & B this one....","Had the pleasure of staying here this week as a gift from friends.  Think it may have been expensive as our muddy car really stood out between the hotel Rolls Royces and supercars. 

In all seriousness, this is an amazing hotel.  The downstairs lobby area feels a bit like a shopping mall (expensive one). We had a 'standard' room, which was far from that.  All rooms are duplexes with sweeping marble staircases from the ground floor living area to the bedroom areas.  They are massive.  Great wide window views (we faced downtown dubai).  In all honesty the decor isn't my taste. Very chintzy - dark blues, golds etc.  You couldn't call the hotel modern style.  

Staff were very helpful and couldn't do enough.  Breakfast was understated but very nice.  Allowed a late check out so had use of room for all Of last day.  

Best part is the new terrace out the back stretching over the sea.  A stunning place to spend a few hours.  Bag a lounger on the faux beach by the salt pool and you could be anywhere.  

Is it worth the money? If you need a gold coffee machine then maybe, but otherwise I don't think so. Had better experiences elsewhere, with better dining and leisure, but guess my priorities are different to others.  

Pros
HUGE rooms. Staff on hand. 
Access to any of the Jumeirah hotels and pools there. 
The terrace out the back with salt pool and fake beach

Cons
Style. 
Long waits for buggies at front of hotel to mainland. 
Jet skis and speedboats buzzing and viewing at back of hotel terrace pool.

"Everything I expected and more","I have stayed at some amazing  hotels and after seeing this hotel on tv I thought I would try it .the hotel fully deserves its 7 stars it is pure luxury staff are amazing yet not intrusive spa is best I've ever been in .
We chose to stay in a panoramic suite again was amazing it was like having our own personal hotel this hotel  is over the top gold luxury and if you can afford to go here it's a must .
Food was ok I have had better breakfasts in other hotels but who cares this hotel still beats everywhere else 
Had afternoon tea wasn't too wowed at that as my husband is allergic to a lot of food so everyone else's sandwiches looked amazing but ours looked pretty boring .
We had a meal in our room that was fantastic and had butler service we ate mainly in jumeriah  at the Thai which was beautiful .
We had use of the rolls Royce our driver hussein again was really nice .
We were on floor ten and Kareema which I hope I have spelt right was fantastic at concierge as were the rest of his team ,as we left the hotel all a lot of the staff were outside to say goodbye again a lovely touch .would I go back try and stop me of course I would go back ","5","2016-09"
"7 stars?!?","I think it's highly over rated -- and who gives the ratings?

It's like a lot of spoiled ""matrons"" with too much money all decided to cram every style possible into one building.  Looks like early Vegas glitz and glam.  Gold, red velvet (yes red velvet) fountains everywhere etc etc etc.  Restaurant beyond average.  Had to send back food and drinks, they were vacuuming while we were there.   Again....7 Stars .... I don't think so.","3","2016-11"
"Absolute luxury ","Stayed at the Burj for the 1st two nights of our honeymoon! Wow, words can't describe this amazing hotel. The pool deck was being built when we were here in February 2016. The Scape is now finished and is a fantastic addition to this hotel. It is only available to members and residents so kept very exclusive. We ate at the Al Mahara fish restaurant, Scape restaurant and Al Muntaha, I cannot fault any of these places, my personal favourite was Al Mahara as I love seafood. We were lucky enough to meet Nathan Outlaw himself. The suite was on level five, beautiful big bed with a huge pillow menu, mirrored ceilings, whirlpool bath, lounge, I could go on and on! Breakfasts huge and plentiful, nothing is ever too much trouble. A real once in a lifetime experience ","5","2016-11"
"Amazing ","First time with my fiance and we enjoyed a lot such an amazing hotel staff are all friendly. Very Attentive staff. We feel very comfortable and amazing food. We would definitely visit hete again next year!","5","2016-11"
"Best Dream Hotel","Burj al Arab always has been an Icon with outstanding restaurants and very personal service. Now with the addition of the new pooldeck the dream destination is complete. Watching the sun go down from the infinity pool sipping a glass of Champagne is a cool end to a splendit day.
Worth every penny in satisfaction.

"Terrible ","I was excited about visiting this famous hotel  for drinks in the sky bar.... very disappointed.. we were made to pay before we entered the gates while still in our taxi... 700 dirhams for 2 people.. that got us 2 drinks each and some nuts.. the lighting in the bar made the famous view impossible to see...  no atmosphere whatsoever.. would not reccomend or visit again ","2","2016-11"
"Delicious afternoon tea on the 27th floor!","Waived through the gates (with our booking ref) arrived at the hotel doors where numbers of staff couldn't do enough to assist.The decoration in this place is amazing, as you enter there is an unusual fountain which gives the impression of fish leaping, framed to the sides with enormous fish tanks filled with exotic fish. An incredible example of modern architecture. Up to the floor above, welcomed, waited a short while then whisked 200 metres above sea level in a glass elevator up the side of the hotel. The view is amazing. We arrived in the Sky bar on the 27th floor. Again more discreet but helpful staff guide you to your table. Looking out of the floor to ceiling windows it seems you're on a rather smart ocean adventure. To the left the Palm, to the right the World, sail boats dart around mixing with the ever bigger cruisers way below. The folks on the terrace are sunning themselves at practically sea level.

Following the champagne there's a choice of teas & fruit juices. The food arrives -  quiches, a mousse, sandwiches, scones, cream & jam then a host of smaller cakes, so much delicious food and more if you have room!

What a treat, from our daughter & her boyfriend, to be thoroughly recommended - you can even arrive by helicopter!","5","2016-11"
"New Pool Beach Impressive Addition","We have visited this hotel many times since it opened. It was certainly one of the best up to about 2010 and then we thought it needed some changes to keep up with many other world class hotels. In particular the restaurants and leisure facilities became a little 'tired'.
The large new pool/ beach area includes two large pools and and an excellent new restaurant - Scape and outdoor bar area. It has a very European feel about it and the Royal Cabanas are worth renting. Bar Gold on the top floor of the hotel is a fantastic venue for late night drinks. Bab al Yam is much improved as well. Overall the hotel has done a great job and the Burj is right back up there with the 'best in the world'","5","2016-11"
"Perfection definitely worth the money ","I have been blessed to stay at this beautiful  place on two occasions once when I was 15 years old as a family holiday and  most recently part of my honeymoon . The attention to detail is on another level . The service is beyond words it's an experience you cant really talk about it's speechless and self evident. Me and my husband both are vegetarian. They serviced a full 5 course vegan/ vegetarian breakfast. If you love food then book now eveyday treats dropped off in our apartment .staff really do go above and beyond in every aspect.","5","2015-12"
"Belle expérience","An unusual hotel or luxury is present everywhere a modern architecture with three wonderful restaurant staff irreproachable. We had the room overlooking the bay. The cleanliness of the service and the cleanliness hygiene interior decoration of great quality. Maximum security, we were able to move helicopter thanks to the airport. Stay at the top","5","2016-10"
"Amazing experience","I went there for my sister's 30th birthday
it was a great experience, the waiter was really attentive to our needs , helping us get the best choice in the menu. food was delicious
it was a wonderful evening, they even offered my sister a cake and a rose for her birthday.
service is one of the best i ever had!","4","2015-12"
"Afternoon Tea","We have just come back from an amazing afternoon tea at Burj, the service from the staff was to a very high standard the food and drinks were fresh and the staff kept replenishing the food. The views were amazing. This is a must to do while you are in Dubai. ","5","2016-11"
"An amazing hotel!","I had the opportunity to stay at the panoramic suite for 3 days and it was amazing. Every single part of the room was full of luxuries and surprises. I love the gold staircase going upstairs to bedroom. The views of the beach are just breathtaking. I will definitely be staying again in near future.","5","2016-05"
"Evening Meal","Fabulous food, a special night. Excellent service always with a smile, nothing was too much trouble. The only one down side of booking evening meal is that it is dark outside and you can only see your reflection in the windows rather than the amazing views unless you go up to the glass itself. Therefore I would maybe recommend afternoon tea instead (and it would be cheaper).","5","2016-09"
"Nice meal, lovely restaurant, good service","We visited the Burj for an evening meal.  Good selection of dishes, lovely ambience, helpful staff.  We were disappointed with the baked cod.which was watery and bland.  However, the lobster risotto and the dover sole followed by the divine sticky toffee pudding if you have room made up for this!  The restaurant have a very good children's menu too and the staff were very welcoming.","4","2016-10"
"Trip to burj al Arab ","Sunset view near to burj alarab area .. Puplic beach is very clean and organized .. For safety there are Guard in every meters people surfing in sea .. The view is amazing and nice atmosphere there ..","4","2016-11"
"Fantastic Venue for Afternoon Tea ","We booked afternoon tea here for 4pm.  This was an ideal time as we were at the top during the daylight and then again for the sunset, which was fab over the Palm.  Afternoon Tea was a fab experience here, with the views over the Palm.  We had 1 glass of champagne as part of the package with afternoon tea.  You could have as much coffee or soft drinks as you wanted.  They even kept bringing more food until you had enough. The Hotel experience was fab inside. We got some fab photos at the top and throughout the hotel. We loved it here. Expensive but we had a fab time and really enjoyed it.  Will be one of those memories we will always remember. ","5","2016-10"
"Cocktails and meal ","Well we have now returned from Dubai. On our last night we managed to book the Skybar for drinks then Scape to eat. Very excited ! Shame we left very disappointed ! Drinks nice bar nice nothing exciting. Scape restaurant nice al fresco eating. Had the special steak ! Served with frozen chips ! Called Truffled Fries but they were from a pack of frozen chips ! I was speechless ! Green beans were very tasty but at their prices they should be !!! Then we were told to order dessert soon as staff going home soon ! It was 21:15 in the evening. Then all the chairs and tables were moved around us !!! All in all not what I was expecting from a 7 star establishment !!! Was a very mediocre meal and experience - staff far too busy explaining how wonderful everything is rather than actually making it wonderful. I suggest you all save your money and try elsewhere. ","1","2016-11"
"Best service ever ","We visited burj arab with family and we were served by a kenyan lady mercy from scape restaurant and she has the most welcoming smile so helpful and very happy recommended us the best delicious Burratta and sea bass we will definately visit again because of her and i would recommend my friends to visit ","5","2016-11"
"Afternoon tea","Most amazing afternoon tea at this iconic hotel - from the moment you arrive you are looked after to the highest standard. This hotel is pure opulence- the sky bar has the best views ever - food and drinks were wonderful - staff and service exemplary- a must do when visiting Dubai","5","2016-11"
"Thank you Burj Al Arab for memories to last a lifetime.","My wife and I, who had previously visited the Burj Al Arab decided to take the opportunity to visit again along with our 2 daughters, and chose to book dinner at Bab Al Yam buffet restaurant.
Attending the hotel, I made contact with one of the greeting staff in the lobby.
Whilst we were anticipating a memorial experience, we never imagined how fantastic our evening was to become.
The greeter [ I’m so sorry I didn’t take her name to give her a 7-star mention here] invited us to visit the new bar “Gold on 27” for a pre-meal drink which we willingly accepted.
We were escorted to the bar and introduced to the staff by her in a seamless and professional manor
The ambience, service and view were amazing, and to find a fault would be impossible.
We took the opportunity to put back our restaurant booking by 30 minutes to relax and enjoy the unexpected visit.
Arriving at the Bab Al Yam restaurant, we were greeted and shown around before being offered the choice of inside or outside table.
The choices of food were exceptional, plus chefs were on hand to cook fresh meat and Pizza type dishes.
We were treated fantastically by all the staff.
Retiring outside for coffee we were greeted by the duty manager Nalaka Prasad who discussed his pride in working at the hotel the New north deck construction.
Nalaka then organised a buggy to take us down to the Madinat to end the evening.
We visited a 7-star hotel and received 7-star experience and service from start to finish.
The staff ability to serve without being intrusive is a credit to all those who select and manage them
Thank you Burj Al Arab for memories to last a lifetime.","5","2016-10"
"Cocktails","Went to the Burj Al Arab for cocktails with friends and had a great time. Yes it's expensive but the views of Dubai are incredible. The hotel is over the top for sure but great to see. The cocktails were lovely and staff v freindly. Recommend a visit.","5","2016-11"
"Lunch at Burj al Arab","I had an enjoyable buffet lunch at Burj al Arab. There were a good selection of Arabic dishes. I didnt know where to start. Waiters provided great customer service and always check if we have drinks on the table.","5","2016-10"
"Family Holiday","Wow ok this has to be the best place I have stayed in. Absolutely beautiful. Attention to detail is second to none. Can not fault this place at all. If you ever have the opportunity to stay at the Burj Al Arab I would suggest doing so. Staff were brilliant especially greeting staff and private butler. Magnificent views. Rooms are huge. Free Hermes perfumes for him and her which is a bonus.","5","2016-01"
"Al Mahara restaurant","Yes it is in the Burj Al Arab so it should be good. From the moment we arrived in our chauffeur driven car, the level of service and the standard of food was simply awesome. Highly attentive staff made our visit worth the money. It was expensive as one would expect but it was worth every penny (dirham)","5","2015-12"
"Awesome","Best stay if you're planning to go to the Middle East 
Welcoming was the best cuz they do have a separate way of approaching their clients
I didnt have to question anything 
Answers were already bought up 
Close to perfection","5","2016-07"
"Dinner at the Burj","What an impressive place. Brought my sons for their 18th and 21st birthdays. beautiful location. Food was good but the buffet food took ages to be replaced when it ran out. Also the lobster was replaced with crab. Not the same!!
Loved sharing the experience with my boys.","4","2016-10"
"Average dining experience!","First visit to Dubai so had to dine at the Burj on our anniversary!
Impressive place of course but the same could not be said for the meal unfortunately.
Slightly confusing getting two fish dishes together firstly but no matter.
Lobster risotto was excellent, but no other courses impressed. 
Desert of sticky toffee pudding was especially average and the same as is served in pubs clubs and restaurants throughout Britain - if I wanted a taste of Cornwall as such I would have gone there instead!
Expensive, of course but fully expected that anyway.
Needs toilet attendants as my wife had to inform staff of wc covered in vomit and unusable - would have expected staff to be  on top of issues like this as they were everywhere else we went in the city.
Don't want to go in too long as I generally ignore long winging reviews but this was not the brilliant dining experience it should have been!
Return visit, very unlikely!","3","2016-10"
"Awesome 7 Star Property","The Burj al-Arab Tower hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates is the fourth tallest hotel in the world; however, 39% of its total height is made up of non-occupiable space. It stands on an artificial island 280 m (920 ft) from Jumeirah beach and is connected to the mainland by a private curving bridge. The shape of the structure is designed to look like the sail of a ship. It also has a helipad near the roof at a height of 210 m (689 ft) above ground.

It's a wonderful structure to watch from a distance. It's shaped like a sail and which is its specialty. This is a definitely an attraction to visit if you are touring UAE, provided you have earmarked substantial amount of budget if not to stay here than at least for a lavish meal in one of its restaurants. As for me I did neither, I saw architectural wonder from the beach and it looked amazing.","5","2015-11"

"The most amazing hotel in the world","Starting with Charles at the front door, you are treated like royalty.   Personalized butler service, (i recommend Paul) personal concierge service, the nicest suites, and an amazingly decorated space makes this hotel experience unforgettable.   Also, one of the most unique hotel destinations in the world.","5","2016-10"
"Unique hotel","This our 3rd time at Burj al Arab and we still love the place. Large and luxurious suite, private butler day and night, Hermes retail size amenities, private exclusive beach club, candy trolley every evening for the kids etc. The best new feature we got to experience is their brand new over the sea pools, so beautiful with an excellent service. We went to Scape and Al Mahara to dine, both worth to go. 

I could not rate this property as excellent for 2 reasons:
- they serve for breakfast an extremely limited choice of cheese (2) which is really poor in quality. Also, they fakely advertised it as Herve Mons cheesemaker which obviously is not true... unacceptable for such a hotel. We informed the french restaurant manager but on our 2 next mornings we could only see our remarks were not taken into account.
- I requested a playstation into the room before our arrival but once we arrived it was not there. They bring one after I reminded them about it but it was not working. The next day after 1 hour of technical support they realized the games were for PS3 and told me all PS4 games were taken. I asked to get one when it gets available but after 3 days they did not bring anything and we check out with my kids sadden they missed the chance to play.

Also I will add that Jumeirah has a extremely strict child policy ; in many of their restaurants it's impossible to go at night with kids. Quite annoying.

"It's all claimed and more","It was extraordinary. The Amex upgrade was to a two bedroom suite that you wanted to be a permanent resident of. Butler service on each floor was supurb. Every few hours there was a beverage or edible surprise in the room. Every employee is nice and action oriented. The only not seven star area was the traditional breakfast room which felt more like a pool snack bar area. No worry, can go to the Asian breakfast buffet. While pricey, you end up feeling it was great value. Pool areas are beautiful. the hotel is pristine clean...much perfection.","5","2016-07"
"Wow!  Over the Top Luxury hotel which is a destination in itself!","This iconic hotel is one of a kind.  It really is a destination in itself.  The lobby is something to behold with its jumping fountains and massive aquarium.  This hotel defines Dubai and its excesses.  The suite is HUGE and all their rooms are two stories.  There is a butler on every floor (and there is only something like 10 rooms per floor so they learn your names and are very attentive).  The pool deck is awesome and so is their private beach.  They take you there on a buggy.  We stayed for two nights and only stayed in the hotel...trying all their restaurants and their spa (which is also amazing).  If you can swing the cost (which is steep), its worth experiencing.","5","2016-10"
"More than a luxury!","I have been there for my friend's wedding and we stayed there fo a week! Great place and luxury service. During the ceremony, each of the guest almost had a waiter! What a lovely staff... Thanks.. I really recommend it.","5","2016-01"
"Amazing two night stay celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab for 2 nights at the end of September to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. From the moment we entered until we left we were so well looked after and wanted for nothing. The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us without being in our faces either. Our Suite was the one bedroom deluxe but unfortunately on entering it I found that there was a lingering odour. To me it smelled like a smoke smell. There was a air purifier plugged in to dissipate the smell I assume. It didn't bother my husband so I let it go while we toured the hotel but when we returned to our suite I decided I wasn't happy with the suite on account of this smell. We spoke to our butler and within minutes we were moved to another suite, one floor higher and were given a complimentary upgrade to a two bedroom suite. It was amazing. The space, the views, the luxury, all fabulous. And no smell, whatsoever!!!! 

We ate at Junsui on the first night and Al Mahara on the second night. I will review these separately. 

The newly opened terrace and two pool, fresh water and infinity salt water pools were fabulous. We were given a cooler bag filled with water and cold towels with the staff checking intermittently if we were ok and/or needed anything else. 

Our children joined us on the third day and were also doted on and well looked after by the staff. Plenty of life guards on duty at all pools. 

All in all a fabulous stay. Would love to stay we'll be back again, perhaps for another very special occasion.","5","2016-09"
"The start of our honeymoon ","So we had a scratch that needed an itch !
And we did it 2 nights in the burj al Arab, before heading if to the Seychelles, it's a kind of Disney for rich kids, there's nothing special about the burj all the rooms are exactly the same and it's one butler for each floor, so you won't feel special,  everything spray painted in gold looks kind of tacky we did the food flight, started of in the gold bar lovely room full of smoke were not smokers we asked to move to a non smoking area they don't have one ? Not happy my expensive Valentino dress stinking of cigarettes, The meals were lovely but nothing special no Michelin star just different restaurants, Nathan outlaw is not included in the meal flight, you would expect the most expensive hotel in the world 7 star to have more than one Michelin star Restaruant the best place was the pool bar lamb chops they were great,  we ended up our last place in the lobby for desert eeeeerrrrrmmmmm not what I expected at all kind of a piss take when you have done the whole thing, hmmmmm would I go or stay again probably not, sorry burj can't give you 5 star it's not worth the money ! ","3","2016-10"
"Lush hotel and cocktail bar, truly 7*","My sister and I visited last weekend and spent some time in and around the Burj Al Arab and had cocktails in the Sky View Bar (after pre booking very far in advance!) Both the interior and exterior of the building is stunning and everyone working there are so attentive, helpful and friendly, particular the gentleman working on the door and the cocktail bar staff. The cocktail choices were excellent in our package and the usual menu for cocktails goes on forever! There is so much to choose from! Even the toilet areas in the hotel are stunning - we really didn't want to leave! After we had cocktails here, we got the complimentary buggy car to the 360 degree bar round the corner...DO IT!! It was awesome and a great way of seeing the Burj from all angles, especially at night time!
My only criticism - and piece of advice - is a warning about your shoes, ladies in particular! I wore thin heeled stilletto Christian Louboutins! As you go up the escalator (which was dodgy enough in these heels!) there is a beautiful fountain and golden yellow floor...this floor has gaps in it big enough for your thin heels to get stuck in! This happened to me and I have badly damaged my £500 shoes which need specialist repair. Be careful ladies in Louboutins! I did report this to a couple of staff members, the lady especially said she would pass this on.
But overall, a fabulous place to visit and especially for cocktails on an evening!","5","2016-10"
"Afternoon Tea","Recent stay in Dubai just had to go to Burj Al Arab for an amazing afternoon tea! What a fab afternoon, food absolutely great, service great, views amazing! This is an expensive experience but really worth it, even to the point we received a lovely red rose as we were celebrating our anniversary plus I received a lovely little birthday cake as the whole trip was for my belated birthday! Would recommend this for the ultimate afternoon tea in an amazing surrounding!","5","2016-10"
"Lunch","Buffet lunch for so much money. Expected to be waited on . Well disappointed. Food so ordinary.  So hard to believe it was 7* standard.  However hotel is unique and beautiful  . The  majority of staff were lovely.  Except for a chap in the afternoon tea section. Didn't allow people to take photos. Beautiful expensive chic shops inside the Burj al Arab.  ","4","2016-10"
"Afternoon Tea Delight","On a recent holiday to Dubai we treated ourselves to a wonderful afternoon tea in the Sky Lounge of the Burj Al Arab.  We chose the 4.30pm sitting so as we could watch the sun setting over The Palm.  It was quite spectacular.  This is not a cheap afternoon tea by any means but the staff are attentive and the food lovely and the views to die for.  I was a little disappointed by the choice of cakes however - I don't know if this was due to us eating at the last sitting.  All in all however it did not disappoint and we thoroughly enjoyed this royal treat.","4","2016-10"
"Loving stayCation","This is one of the most memorable staycation i've ever been. The panoramic view makes me feel like a Queen that conquer the place. The amazing staff and a butler that guides you can easily help you out if u need something. The 2 storey room is super duper amazing its like your at home in rich version. The bathroom has its own jacuzzi and other pampering bath to feed your body scents. The living room w/ the Gold set surrounded the TV is jaw dropping! My stay at this cozy 7star hotel is what u need if u want to experience a luxury lifestyle. Staying here for 2days is like a dream that came true.","5","2016-07"

"Gilden","Burj Al Arab is a unique hotel.

"Fantastic everyone should visit :-) ","The best afternoon tea I have ever had and the food and drinks were unlimited- we were slightly worried that it wasn't as there was so much and a glass of champagne included in the price, beautiful harpist played requests for me and we were not hurried out the restaurant we spent hours there! Can't wait to go back 😍","5","2016-10"
"Tenth anniversary ","Me my husband and our four year old decided to treat ourselves for our anniversary by staying at this amazing place for 6 nights. From the minute you pull up and they open the car door it was just amazing. You are welcomed like royalty, they new our names before we even got there. On arrival we were given baklava and drinks and taken straight to our suite. The suite was gorgeous, very classy and everything you would expect from a 7 star hotel. Fruit is topped up daily and the rooms are services many times a day. The butler service is amazing and was so kind and helpful. 

The facilities are brilliant and we were concerned especially taking a four year old that we may struggle but, it was brilliant and the access to wild wadi was brilliant and the little things like at around 5 a sweet train would come where my little boy would pick sweets for the evening was a great touch. At around the same time we would get a drink and snack complimentary too. 

We went half board, I have to say breakfast wasn't amazing, was good but I would say Atlantis and Jumeriah beach hotels I found to have more choice as we were vegetarian, however saying that the lunch and dinner options were amazing and the staff would go out of their ways to get things made for us if we wanted something in particular.

The beach service was great as you get ice cold water in and ice box and cold flannels, great touch and my boy loved the ice lollies that were handed out. 

We travel to Dubai every year and after staying here instead of our typical Atlantis or jumeriah beach holiday, we wouldn't be able to stay anywhere else.

It is undedsgan how this hotel is the only hotel in the world not to make a profit, just amazing and I think great value","5","2016-05"
"Amazing service during our stay. Sky Tea was just ok.","My husband and I enjoyed the Sky Tea (high tea in the Skyview Lounge) with our family one afternoon, and then checked into the hotel about a week later to stay a couple of nights. 
Upon arriving at the hotel for the Sky Tea I was a bit disappointed, I must admit. The hotel lobby was a little tacky and wasn't as impressive as what I expected from all the hype. The Sky Tea was ok, but very expensive for what it was. The views of Dubai from the Skyview Lounge are impressive but the food is just ok and I can't justify paying that much for some little sandwiches, cakes and scones. 
Staying at the hotel was a completely different experience and I now understand why this is considered one of the best hotels in the world. All the staff were very professional yet friendly (not stuffy) and the personal butler service was fantastic. All our requests were taken care of quickly without any issues. We ate at a few of the restaurants, including the restaurant on the beach, and the food was great. The in-room private dining service was also excellent and the food quality was just as good as eating in the restaurant. The suite was very large and comfortable. I would certainly love to stay here again if we return to Dubai.","5","2016-10"
"Wow!","What an experience - from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you couldn't get any better.  Every single member of staff we encountered were so professional and yet so friendly - it didn't matter what you wanted, you got it.
Yes, it is very expensive - but how they treated us (almost) made it seem worthwhile - nothing is too much trouble.
We travelled mostly between the adjacent hotels by golf buggy and one evening there wasn't one waiting, so the guy on the front door called over one of the chauffeur driven cars and arranged for him to drop us off at the restaurant!
This was a one-off holiday of a life-time and something we will never forget.
If you want a memory - this is the place to go.  Although we are only a normal retired couple, we were treated like royalty.","5","2016-10"
"Excellent hotel but pricey","We enjoyed our stay in this hotel! Amazing architecture and interiors. Service and food were excellent!  Although it's pricey to stay and dine here.  We are looking back to next trip here, hopefully by next year!","4","2016-10"

"Lovely visit to the landmark of Dubai! ","I decided to stay at the Burj Al Arab after hearing that it's built A lovely outdoor terrace with two infinity pools Overlooking the Arabian golf. The hotel itself is lovely and I have been there tons of times. The first time someone sees the magnificent lobby they will be amazed at the sheer architecture and the grandeur of the place. The hotel is filled with gold plated accessories and shiny and sparkling walls. However I believe that the hotel is due for a makeover as most of the rooms and the furniture in the lobby it's from the time the hotel opened in 1998. However that being said, the furniture is still immaculate, add very well-maintained. The rooms are very spacious and they have two floors each, the lower floor contains the living room while the higher floor contains the bedroom. All suites offer a breathtaking views of the Arabian Gulf.

Breakfast was served in two places, and the ground floor and the basement floor next to the pool. There are two pools with in the hotel property. The first pool is freshwater while the other pool is saltwater. This full contains beautiful views of the Gulf as well as views of the amazing architecture of Burj Al Arab.

One thing that I noticed about the hotel is that the dining options are plentiful however the food is not that appetizing and overpriced. The room service menu contains many options however not one thing I ordered was tasty. I think the hotel should revisit it's prices as well as the quality of food they serve.

"Amazing Interior and 7 Star Hospitality","Booked a evening High Tea for me, my wife and my 7 month old baby. Had a lovely time and can truly say have never seen such beautiful architecture within a hotel. The 7 star service speaks for itself and make sure you come hungry as there is loads to eat. Definitely worth a visit. ","5","2016-09"
"Enjoyable Weekend Stay","Stayed with friends in two separate Suites for the weekend.  Room was still being prepared on arrival but offered complimentary coffee in the upstairs lobby whilst waiting.  Requested high-floor/non-smoking but given low-floor/smoking so rooms eventually changed upon request.  Service was very impersonal and not up to expectations although the hotel is still well-maintained overall.  The new pool deck area is magnificent and staff were friendly/welcoming in this area.  Breakfast also excellent (as to be expected) but with limited seating - thankfully arrived early to enjoy table near window with great views.  Overall standards slipped a little during stay but to be expected from Jumeirah these days - perhaps an over-rated brand.  Hope to be better next time around.","4","2016-07"

"Polite, warm welcoming staff at the Burj Al Arab","We met Elena a front reception staff at the Ossiana restaurant at the Atlantis. The restaurant is high end but this particular staff appears a snob as though she owned the restaurant.  

The complete reverse happened to us at the Burj Al Arab. The staff there were as polite, warm and welcoming as can be and at the same time keep to their policies as to visitor control issues.  Several names came to our minds when we visited the Burj Al Arab.  Ms Saroj and Mr Mani from the Al Muntaha restaurant are excellent ambassadors of the hotel. They helped us with our enquiries with great hospitality. And of course Ms Elmira a most charming cheerful helpful Kahzakstan staff who we met at the poolside.  These 3 individuals worked in a so-called 7star hotel and yet they were as unpretentious and unsnobberish as can be.  Unlike the Elena who believed she ""owned"" the Ossiana at the Atlantis.","5","2016-10"
"Excelent conditions but overpriced","So in my opinion this hotel is a MUST TRY experience. You will be treated as all of us shoud be, like kings/queens/princes/princess. From the very first time when you reach the hotel with taxi/limo/whatever you will have someone from the staff present with you, they will explain everything you need to know as they are walking you to the floor where you will stay. After reaching the floor you will be presented to your own concierge person who will show you the room (the smallest room is 160 sq.m, on two floors). Everything you need you will have in the room: from personal computer (Apple), printer, perfumes, free movies, and everything else. We order only in the room, and the food it was quite good. If you will be with children then you must take the opportunity to use also the Aquapark (where you will have free entry) situated just 200-300 metres away. Also I would highly recommend you to try the free tour of the entire area with all the hotels that belongs to the same group. You can take it from the entrance of the hotel, and you will have a golf car with a very good personal guide tour that can teach you a lot of new things and show you some great places from where you can take pictures. The breakfast was really great, exactly as we have expected it. My only concern wa the price that we have to pay, but if money are not a problem ... then ... Burj Al Arab ... is a MUST.","5","2016-06"
"High tea, high view","Visited here for high tea as a treat whilst on honeymoon. Not cheap at around £100 each but totally worth it......once in a lifetime experience. (real gold sprinkles on your Cappuccino!!!!).....Service from our waiter Chi, food, ambience, views......the whole lot could not be faulted!!!","5","2016-09"
"Best Resort in the world ","This is the most incredible, experience in our lives. The quality, customer satisfaction and the kind of service we found here is almost impossible to find in any other place. The minute you walk in be prepared to be pampered and be spoiled. If you want a resort that knows what you need even before You know it This is you Resort. ","5","2016-07"
"7 star hotel","onvergetelijke ervaring. we did new years eve in the burj and stayed there 5 days. a place never to forget. It was a duplex with a lot of gold, all the bathrooms were with hermes perfume and we were served like kings. 7 star +++","5","2015-12"
"Afternoon Tea","Having experienced afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab on 4 previous occasions, like a vintage wine, it gets better as time passes. The hotel never ceases to amaze me with its timeless interior decor and the high quality of all of the furnishings everywhere yo go. 
We took tea in the Sahn Eddar which is on the first floor overlooking the front entrance to the hotel. There were seven courses as well as champagne and every course made the experience even better. 
Belinda and her staff were very attentive and as you would expect, we received excellent service for the 2 hours e were there. 
Once finished, were were escorted by Belinda to view the changes that had taken place at the hotel during the last 2 years.
 This included a new fish restaurant with Michelin star chef  Nathan Outlaw, the new Gold On  27 bar and the sun terrace with sea and fresh water pools that have been added to the sea facing side of the hotel. All the new additions are sumptuously decorated, have fantastic views and no doubt will be great additions to this wonderful hotel.
Going there is such a great experience and it does cost a lot of money to dine there, but it is worth every penny.
I cannot wait until the next time!
Well done Burj Al Arab management team for a truly 7 star experience and a must to anyone visiting Dubai!","5","2016-09"
"Inside was amazing","Me and my wife entered the Burj al Arab after visiting the souk madinat Jumeirah.
The drive from the security gate to the hotel is surreal as you can see it getting bigger and bigger as you get closer.
we entered the hotel to the most beautiful lobby you can see, with a huge fish tank along the wall near the escalator.
the staff are very friendly, polite and provide great service.
The first floor has live music playing in the restaurant and there are many shops to browse in before entering the sky bar area.
It was a wonderful experience for the both of us.","5","2016-09"
"Afternoon tea ","Definitely worth the trip and price tag , exceptional views over Dubai and the hotel interior is like a work of art. The tea itself was delicious and very filling . Waiting staff and hosts went above and beyond . More than happy to take photos for us etc. Just fabulous ","5","2016-09"
"Dinner at Bab Al Yam","We spent the evening at Bab Al Yam buffet for my sister Joan's 39th birthday.  Great view, friendly staff and the food and service were both excellent. It's an amazing seven start hotel. Highly recommended. ","5","2016-09"
"Dinner at Burj Al Arab","It's a pricey hotel, and dinner didn't come cheap, but it was the easiest way to get inside and check out this iconic building! The food and service were both excellent. We had drinks in the Sky Bar before dinner, which gave us a lovely view of the area. Highly recommend!","5","2016-06"
"Afternoon tea ","We booked afternoon tea as a treat on our honeymoon to Dubai! It was the most delicious afternoon tea I have ever had! 7 courses of cakes, beautiful sandwiches, sorbets, pastries and other goodies!

The service was faultless, we really had a wonderful time! ","5","2016-09"
"Everything you could wish for","My family and I visited the hotel to celebrate my fathers 50th birthday, the hotel was exceptional. 

The staff were all very polite, very professional but at the same time the were extremely approachable. Every time we had a question or a request they were only too happy to help and consistently went above and beyond. 

The room was simply incredible. We had a gorgeous suit and everything was beautifully decorated. There are so many positives about the room I can't list them all. 

I would go back to this hotel at the drop of a hat! ","5","2016-01"
"Lovely hotel, but perhaps over rated","I have stayed at the Burj twice and while it is a curiosity, I would have to say that both experiences left me with the feeling that it is over rated.  The fact that they now allow tourists to come into the entrance says a lot for a hotel that is claiming elite status.  It is a lovely hotel.if you like lots of gold, and the staff are generally very friendly. The food was a high standard, and the surroundings very plush, but somehow for me it was just too much. ","3","2015-10"
"Unexpected but amazing","Always planned holiday for this place but never got time. But unexpected visit happened when my company gave me a chance to business visit. Word can't explain how amazing is that place is. Just something you would want to see over and over again. Business visit could not get most out of the visit but still enjoyed every second of it.","5","2016-09"
"Amazing","If you only ever do this once it will be an experience. We had a wonderful meal with a bottle of wine. It's not cheap but if you know Dubai you will know this is the only 7 star experience worth doing. Head up to gold on 7 a new bar on 27th floor. Then if you fancy splashing the cash go to sky bar for brunch or drinks. Pre book all of these . Wow amazing.","5","2016-09"
"CULINARY FLIGHT","Culinary flight 
Four of us went to the burj al arab for a culinary journey on our last night in dubai.this is where you have a different meal in a different restaurant of some of each chefs signatures dishes.
This is a excellent way to see all areas of the hotel and taste many different foods.
We started on top floor in the sky lounge for cocktails.
i opted for the vodka cocktail which was lovely and very easy to drink.
 We were given a menu to pick a appetiser two mains and a desert from the restaurants we was going to visit that night 
The menu i picked was  crab and caviar starter followed by shrimp and king prawn followed by waygu beef steak and finished off with a hazelnut paris dessert.(please see menu pictures below)
all of my meals were presented to a very high standard and cooked too perfection.all my friends enjoyed there meals too.i tbink they had more fush meals than anything else.
The hotel is breath taking and the staff are trained to the highest standard nothing is too much trouble and you are not made too feel inferior too anybody else.
You are escorted from each restaurant by a member of staff who go out the way to answer any questions and give you some facts about the hotel.If you recieve your starter and are worried you are not going to get food dont worry the dishes get bigger and better as you move too each restaurant. 
A lady i would like too particular mention is the lady from the asian restaurant who went out of her way to take pictures for us and show us around pool area and other stuff we would not of seen if it wasnt for her.Am sorry i didnt get her name but thankyou for all your help..
The meal cost us around 250 pound each not including drinks.As a one off too see this hotel i find this quite reasonable considering the service and standard of food we recieved .
attention to detail is impeccable for example,we ordered all our meals in the cocktail bar but once are meals came in each different restaurant they automatically knew who had ordered what.although we were getting served by different people throughout our culinary journey
bottles of heineken are just over £10 each.so if you price your food and drink and around £300 each then you know if this is acceptable for you too pay or not
so if your are unsure of booking culinary flight or not please take my word and go ahead and book it.you wont be dissapointed .
The bits we did see of the hotel looked stunning and am sure there are even more stunning bits that we didnt see.
a very fitting ending to a fabulous holiday....

","5","2016-09"
"Afternoon tea","It was fantastic the whole experience from getting out the taxi to going back, we were met at the door and as we were early he showed us round the hotel so we could take pictures. The afternoon tea was seven courses and we sat down at 2.45 and got up at 5.45 and the most enjoyable afternoon I think I have ever had.","5","2016-09"
"Excellant stay at the Burj Al Arab 7*","We stayed here for 3 nights with family. It was amazing. The Panoramic Room is just superb with a view of Jumeira Beach Hotel. You are made to feel like a celebrity or royalty from the outset. We stayed 3 nights a Jumeira Beach also. The 7 series BMW picked us up from Jumeira Beach to Burj. Although the distance is less than a mile. But a nice gesture as this transfer was not included in the package. 
You are always greeted with a Good morning or afternoon everytime you walk past the staff. Majority of the staff also know your name and greet you by it.
They always ask you if you are celebrating any occaision so they can make your day extra special with cakes and light bites and drinks on the house.
The hotel is expensive but worth it. Try to take the Panoramic and Half Board option as these are worth the money. Very expensive otherwise. 
The new Terrace is just Devine. Now you dont need to leave the hotel as everything is there now for you. 
Our Butler (Mandel) took us to see the SkyView Bar and also the Royal Suite 25th floor. This was one amazing suite which can cost upwards of £10000 per night, hence the word ROYAL in it. 
We were happy with our stay in Jumeira Beach Hotel but Burj was 5 time better. 
The staff will do everything for you, you just need to mention it. 
You cannot enter the Burj unless you are staying there, or afternoon Tea or visiting someone. I had a visitor so just informed the butler who sorted it all out, like informed the Welcome center, Valet parking, ID check. No problems there. Visitors either need their passport with them or Government issued ID.
Burj is all high tech with 24 hr WiFi, Satellite channels, electric curtains, Mac computer, scanner/printer, photocopier tea coffee machine.
You also have unlimited free access to Wild Wadi Park. Normally its 315AED per person.
I would definitely stay here next time. Just need to start saving again.....","5","2016-09"
"Fantastic ","We spent the evening at the junsui  Asian buffet for my birthday , I've never been to a place that looks after you the way that they do nothing was to much trouble and the attention to detail was brilliant the food was amazing and worth every penny a special mention for Asi a superb waiter who couldn't do enough to make our night very special thank you burj al Arab it was amazing and I would highly recommend ","5","2016-09"
"Out of this WORLD hotel....","WOW - we have just returned from Dubai after spending 5 days at the 7 star Burj al Arab. I planned the trip to celebrate my husbands 50th and our recent wedding.   I booked the helicopter transfer from the airport to the hotel, what an experience !!!   We were whisked off the air craft to a waiting luxury car which took us to the VIP lounge and away from the crowds. We were served coffee and croissant's whilst our passport were stamped and our bags retrieved from the bustling baggage carousels - we were then back into the car to the helicopter.   Crikey, talk about arriving in style!!!  A flight over Dubai was fabulous and we were able to have a birds eye view of this incredible place, we landed on the helipad at the Burj WOW what a way to arrive an amazing, exhilarating experience  - we felt like celebrities.  We were greeted by the general manager Tony McHale and his team and served drinks, dates and given beautiful flowers.   We were then escorted to our room - the room was just luxurious and the views were breath-taking.  A split level suite with a huge bedroom, dressing room and bathroom, the toiletries were 7 star, anything you could ever want! A sweeping stair case with huge glittering chandelier led downstairs into the lounge area with dining area and bar -  drinks were served at sun down with delicious snacks, the breakfast buffet was perfect, on our last night we were served champagne, snacks a lovely chocolate cake and our room was decorated with red roses, very romantic.   The new terrace was stylish and elegant with beautiful swimming pools and perfect service (Thank you to Paul and his team).  We ate at the Al Muntaha (27 floor) - it was a night to remember the food and wine and service reflected the 7 stars status - a fitting way to celebrate our special holiday. The Butler service was amazing they were on hand 24 hours a day to make our lives easy, each floor had its own 'butler' station, it always had someone there to help which also help us feel secure. We loved the exclusivity the Burj offered its guests and we loved that we could use an exclusive beach but also loved the water park and executive pool at the Jumeirah resort.    This hotel is amazing, amazing luxury, amazing service!! Whilst the hotel is expensive we would definitely go back, I hope sooner rather than later.  Thank you to everyone at the Burj","5","2016-09"
"Epic!","Simply put, our experience we had in Burj Al Arab was epic.

For us it was the first time to stay over at the Burj Al Arab so of course, a lot of expectations were built up before the arrival at the hotel. We knew we were going to the only 7-star hotel in the world and knew that the Burj Al Arab is a truly iconic hotel. 
In summary, our expectations were exceeded. For us, probably the best way to describe our experience at the Burj Al Arab is to use our son’s word: “epic”. I think it best describes the hotel and the experience with one word. Amazing and outstanding is not enough.

The quality of the service, the degree of empathy of the team, the selection and quality of food (in particular at the Scape restaurant), and not least the uber-luxurious rooms (including the incredible bathrooms with Hermes amenities) are top, full stop.

The new Burj Al Arab terrace is brilliant, not only from the conception but all the way to the execution into the tiniest details. This terrace with the two stunning pools, one of them with a bar in the middle, flanked by the amazing cabanas sets a new standard in Dubai and probably in the world. The cabanas that you have built on the side of terrace are the cherry on the cake. The whole is just wow!

An immense thank you to you and your team for what we were able to experience - we consider our experience unforgettable. It was very difficult to leave the hotel after our experience, but we said to ourselves that we will come back and experience this again!","5","2016-08"
"Oh my goodness!","This is one of the best hotels I can conclude today experimentally because this hotel is amazing! What kind of service they provide me was speechless if you're travelling to Dubai and kind of you want to spend money on hotels and luxury I recommend you to please invest your money in this hotel for a night which is kind of expensive but it's equally worth you live for a night","5","2016-09"
"Not Impressed","Perhaps I'm not cut out for a life of luxury, but I found the entire Burj experience to be a bit over the top.  I also found the staff to be overbearing and outright rude in some instances.

I'll clarify that our butler and check-in/out staff were amazing.  They attended to everything we needed without being intrusive, and they were very helpful.  What I didn't care for was having to explain to the staff every time I came out of the elevator that yes, I am a guest, and provide my room number.  I didn't like that every step I took around the pool area I had to explain that yes, I am a guest and provide my room number.  I didn't pay $$$$ to stay here to feel like an intruder every time I set foot in a common area.  

At one point we tried to go to the Skybar to have a drink and the woman at the elevator actually scoffed at us.  How dare we assume that because we're guests in a hotel we paid a fortune for that we'd have access to something like the hotel bar?!  Apparently, even hotel guests need a reservation, so if you want to have a drink on the night of your arrival you'd better make reservations in advance.  Instead we had drinks and shisha at the pool bar with no scoffing or hassle.

We sat in a line of traffic for over 20 min to give our name to the gatekeeper just to be allowed to drive onto the property.  I suppose features like this make some people feel exclusive, but I found it to be a big turnoff right from the start.

The lobby is the most impressive part of the hotel.  The room was nice, but way over the top.  I really don't need remote-controlled curtains and door openers, but the novelty was fun.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.  The high-end toiletries, wine and other treats were a welcomed benefit, but wouldn't convince me to stay here again.

All in all, I feel like I paid for the Burj name and an air of superiority from a large percentage of the hotel staff.  Next time I will spend my money at a hotel that doesn't make me feel below them.","3","2016-09"
"7 Star Hotel","You cannot get in the Burj Al-Arab Hotel if you are not a hotel guest or don't have an appointment to the Tea House. 

We can get near it only through the entrance near the Wadi Water Park. Some suggest to take the Ferry boat or the yellow boat  to take pictures around it.

The building is really an architectural and engineering wonder. 
 ","5","2016-08"
"Amazing architecture ","My daughter and I visited Burj Al Arab on Saturday night. We went for drinks at the sky view bar. Our hotel made a reservation for us and you have to show the paperwork at the guard at the gate to be admitted just into the massive driveway. I was totally blown away as the taxi drove down the long entrance road. The Burj al Arab stood in front of us reaching to the sky. A massive sail shape lit with highlight blue lights. On entering the beautiful front doors we were faced with glass walls from floor to ceiling filled with tropical fish and fountains with shooting waterfalls. It was like a story book. We were then shown into an upper lift taking us to the 124 floor in a speed of 5 mins. On entering the sky view bar and lounge I felt like I was in a boat. The amazing night light views was incredible. The hotel is very expensive but one of the best experiences I've ever had. If in Dubai it is definitely worth a visit something you'll never forget. But remember you have to make a reservation first.","5","2016-09"
"Best Hotel in the world","The Burj is just brilliant, from the ,moment you arrive to the time you leave.

Rooms are exceptional and the staff attentive and polite.

House keeping performed twice a day, and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.

Thoroughly recommended.","5","2016-09"
"Another Great Stay","We returned to this hotel in July for 3 nights as part of a 10 night trip for my husbands 50th birthday and our friends 40th wedding anniversary.  

We were really excited about returning as when we stayed a year earlier all the work building for the new sun decks and pool areas was just about to commence 

We were not disappointed as the new areas are huge and loved the pools .. Especially at the far end overlooking the sea and especially interesting watching the boats and jet skiers doing their tricks ... Everyone loved watching them.  Rest of the time it was extremely relaxing and very well run by manager Paul who looked after us and was such a nice chap 

Nice pool bar in the middle of one pool under a bridge so nicely shaded away from mid day sun we enjoyed a few drinks here 

As always the duplex suites are stunning and beautifully furnished and well appointed. Amazing toiletries 

Unfortunately my husbands favourite restaurant was closed for refurbishment ( Al Mahara) the fish restaurant so we booked instead at Al Muntaha for his 50th dinner with our friends and we were given a great table and food was brilliant. Prior to this we visited the sky bar for cocktails and very good 

Although dinner at Al Iwan was good it was buffet style and we prefer full waiter service for dinner 

We visited for the first time Gold on 27 for cocktails which we thought was excellent with great music ... Worth a visit 

We were looked after really well and really nice 50th birthday when the butlers arrived with guitar and all sang happy birthday and with cake and flowers . The next day they did the same for our friends on their 40th anniversary 

Will definitely return again next year

"Top Dog","We visited the Burg Al A Arab for afternoon tea although a little expensive for the working couple we thought we would push the boat out 1 time!! The afternoon tea was splendid, the  souroundings fantastic, the staff very attentive, what more can I say. we visited sept 2014.","5","2015-10"
"Great Staff","We normally stay at JBH but always make a trip to the Burj. During our recent stay we went to the Burj several times for tea, drinks and dinner. During one of these visits the very lovely Assistant Manager, Catherine met with us and gave us an amazing personalised tour of the suites. She welcomed us to stay on our next trip. She was very personable and friendly. The hotel itself is beautiful - rich, vibrant, royal colours. Staff are very friendly and the food is delicious! ","5","2016-09"
"Incredible 7 Star Experience *******","Where to start! Truly the experience of a lifetime. We have visited Dubai 5 times in the last 7 years with our children but never stayed at Burj Al Arab before. Now our kids have grown up and doing their own thing we decided to visit here for our first trip to Dubai as a couple. The service and attention to detail is 100% fabulous from start to finish. We stayed for a week and did not want to leave. The suites are incredible and luxurious and we especially loved the remote control workings of the curtains, doors and tv's and our view over Dubai city and the Palm were breathtaking. We dined in most of the hotel restaurants and spent some evenings in the Gold Bar and Sky Bar. As you would expect from a Hotel of this standard the food and drink can be expensive but the quality and service speak volumes. I recommend the Mrs Big cocktail in the Sky Bar which is a ceramic teapot in the shape of a handbag (that gives around 3 small martini style glasses of the basic cocktail mix) and a tray with 3 different coloured ""nail varnish"" (which are different flavours for your basic cocktail mix) and a lipstick that contains a red jelly you can eat. 
Don't be fooled into thinking Jun Sui restaurant is simply an Asian buffet. It's a culinary genius as the host guides you around the whole of Asia with the many fusion areas then shows you to your table. Then your waiters sort you out with drinks and a tray of crackers and dips while inviting you to start your buffet journey. Periodically the waiters deliver specially cooked sample dishes from the chefs to your table to try in addition to picking your own food. We had to give up eventually but we were invited to stay all evening and keep eating as we wished but unfortunately we could not manage it. Sylvia the Manager is amazing and kindly delivered us a dessert to the table as she likes you to try the whole experience and we had a nice chat with her too. You can have breakfast in Jun Sui (in addition to Bab al Yam) with some traditional breakfast fayre but you can also have a full Asian buffet meal at breakfast if you wish from Sushi to Curry! The new pools and terrace are fantastic with the swim up pool bar. Once pool is sea water with a man made beach area and the other with pool bar is fresh water. We spent every day here lounging in the sun drinking cocktails. The bar and pool staff are a joy, a dream team. Indika, Sheen & Aminder are expert mixologists along with teamleader Guru and nothing is too much trouble. From signature cocktails to old fashioned favourites to making up cocktails for our personal taste they looked after us so well and we loved getting to know them all. Paul is one the managers in this area and really makes sure you are welcomed and taken care of every step of the way. Vimal, Mohan & Marco also looked after us so well around the pool area and we had great fun with them all. The guys appear to have a great relationship with each other too which creates a great atmosphere.
We just missed out on the new outdoor Shisha and DJ bar area on the terrace as it was due to open the week after we left but it looks amazing. We probably would have spent most evenings there after dinner otherwise. 
You also have butlers available outside your suite 24 hours. I was slightly concerned it would be overwhelming but there is no intrusion at all. You could use the butler service as much as you want but we only asked for ice from our butler as everything else was taken care off without having to ask. The butler knows when you are in or out of your suite so there is never a chance of housekeeping knocking on your door while you are in. It's all done while you are out as is the evening turn down service.  
A lovely touch is the gift on your bed each evening ranging from chocolates, pillow spray, body lotions, lip balm and a fan and you get Hermes toiletries including a full size bottle of perfume and aftershave during your stay. 
For the first 5 nights while we were getting showered and ready for dinner we put our do not disturb light on, then discovered we were missing out on complimentary drinks and canapes from our butler who delivers them on a trolley to each suite around 18.00 so we managed to get them for the last 2 nights. 
The staff are a credit to Burj Al Arab and the very high standard of service, professionalism and attention is consistent and they all seem so happy.
The security from the hotel entrance right through to the pool terrace is very good and you can't come in unless you are staying or have a restaurant or bar reservation.    
You can take a golf buggy from the hotel to Jumeirah beach areas then water taxis along the Madinat hotels (no charge for hotel guests) and there are lots of nice bars and restaurants here too. It's like a little Venice at night.
There is not one single negative about Burj Al Arab except that you have to leave at some point! Can I come back already?","5","2016-09"
"AMAZING","This all suite hotel is breath taking

"Outstanding facility","Stayed 3 nights while on a business trip. All aspects were top notch. The welcome and in room check in was seamless. Going forward, everyone was pleasant and appropriately inquisitive and helpful without seeming intrusive. My personal butler personally called ahead to confirm all appointments and to confirm pick up and drop offs.","5","2015-10"
"""Our Second Home""","Read my numerous reviews and you will understand why we keep returning and by no means are we millionaires...but once you have been a guest of this wonderful hotel its hard to beat for sure..Swiftly picked up at the airport and greeted by the GM and his staff. Lovely 2 bed suite on the 20th floor with fab views. Chec-in very easy and the unpacking done by the butlers leaving us to go for breakfast and then on to the new stunning terrace seen on the website. We tried the cabanas which were fab so you could spend all day at the pool as has soft drinks etc and looked after by the friendly Abbas who we have come to know and he does a fab job. Had a lovely spa treatment by Cora who made me feel and look like a new woman. Tried four restaurants and have done reviews also. The butlers are not at all intrusive and happy to help. This is the hotel that makes your dreams come true with the help of Ahmed Eiriba, Stephanie Zawada and dear Nimal, so thank you all again and cannot wait to return soon :)","5","2016-08"
"Very pleasant stay ","Went to this beautiful hotel during Christmas period. The rooms are very big and service is impeccable. A butler takes care of any wishes and assists you throughout the whole stay. 
A very good thing is security which is very high all around the hotel, from the entry of the bridge throughout the hotel. 
Only thing missing would be a big outdoor pool, which you get in almost every other Dubai hotel","5","2016-09"
"12 night VIP extravaganza","This was actually our 3rd time staying at BAA. The very first visit is the most exciting.
The second visit we felt more comfortable. This time we had our every wish and expectation exceeded. From our floor butler Gaurav who arranged things we never thought to ask for. To Chef Sulyman in the Bab al Yam breakfast who personally drove to Carrefour supermarket to get cheddar cheese for my husband and baked him fresh from the oven arabic bread each morning. When I found drawer space lacking in the closet a small plastic unit was delivered right away. When we found it a bit hot and humid at night to take the buggie all dressed up we were offered a hotel car. 
I have to say Shukran to Mr. Ahmed and we would never come back unless you are there.
My only negative comment is that while there are signs everywhere that video cameras are not allowed do to the respect and comfort of other guests you can not walk through the lobby or go down the escalator without being in the background of someones clip.
The lifeguards in the ladies only spa pool spend more time asking people not to take pictures in this private area than actually watching the swimmers.","5","2016-09"
"Burj Al Arab","Best hotel I have ever stayed at, everyone was super friendly, helpful, and very welcoming, felt like a second home. Would stay there a million more times! The food there was amazing. The butlers are the most well mannered people in the world. And the driver of the Rolls-Royce when we were going to the airport was extremely friendly as well! I would give this hotel a 10 out of 5 stars!","5","2016-09"
"Now I know why it's 7 star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Well worth every penny, they blew us away with the service levels.  

I've lived in Dubai for 15 years and it takes a lot to impress me.  The Burj Al Arab staff are amazing and couldn't do enough for us.  They ensured this was not only a stay in a hotel but an experience we'll never forget.  

The new pool and terrace area is fantastic.  Could not fault a single thing.  I'll certainly be back.  ","5","2016-06"
"Ultimate afternoon tea","We had a fantastic experience, everything was exceptional.
The staff were amazing and made us feel really special. Catherine, Amy and Agnese were amazing.

I think they should employ me as their secret diner.

I would love to be able to afford a few nights at this hotel.  Absolute luxury.","5","2016-08"
"Lunch - An experience like no other!","The breath taking location, the absolute decadence of the golden lobby, then the top floor restaurant overlooking the sea, just amazing! Lunch was a creative design of 100s of dishes, gloriously presented and laid out in full multi colour.
The service was excellent with detailed information provided on wines and food when we enquired. 
If it's a once in a life time experience you want, this is not likely to disappoint. For the non rich it's not cheap but certainly worth it for the moment.","5","2016-02"
"amazing place","This was my first stay at Burj Al Arab. 

No doubt its iconic and amazing place to stay. The upkeep of this hotel is great. 

The hotel has amazing indoor pool and great beach side. Refreshments are offered from drinks to ice lollies for all guests at the private beach as complimentary.","5","2015-10"
"Fantastic!!!!!","Breathtaking and fantastic, from the welcome onwards-the butler on each floor, the two level suite, the Hermes toiletries, the bar and office in your room, the view, the underwater restaurant, the huuuuge bed, the rooftop lounge, breakfast selection.... I could go on! Amazing","5","2015-12"
"Absolutely Stunning!!","Visited the Burj Al Arab for the Afternoon Tea and the whole experience was just stunning. The food, the service, the hotel, the view- basically everything!

I can not recommend this enough! 

The price is high but do not doubt this, you simply can not miss this experience!","5","2016-08"
"Fantastic experience in Gold 21 Bar","We wanted to see the Burj and explored many options. Staying a night was really outside our budget. Afternoon tea was also very expensive. Visiting the Skyline Bar had a minimum spend per person of about £60 per person.
Gold Bar had no minimum spend but was an experience in itself. We saw some parts of the hotel and enjoyed about 3 hours in the bar. Being one of the most famous hotels in the world we expected to pay a premium for the drinks. We spent around £150 for approx 8 drinks but I do feel it was well worth the experience. Service as expected was great. It was to me the most affordable way to see this exclusive hotel. 
Reservations are required in advance which we did from the Jumeriah Hotel. Also for over 21s only.
We all left happy with some very pleasant memories without spending a fortune for a family of four. If you ever do get opportunity go for it","5","2016-08"
"Luxory and High ","Hotel simply breathtaking !! All Is fantastic , the restaurants the lounges and all the services of the hotel ! Also the position and the architectural is wonderful . The building slowly turning on itself and the lights on the night of the palace is changing continuously  ... the restaurant under the sea, the lounge bar on the roof top with wonderful views, the rooms the gym, the swimming pools ... all very nice and wonderful! the hall full of gold and giant aquariums ... it all seems a fairy... A tale !! Now it all frankly after a while is overwhelming especially for the Arabic style glitz with color spaces and fragrances somewhat exaggerated for a minimal-chic taste like mine , Anyway ""de gustibus"".... still a great experience also considering the services on the beach and in the room .... ""From evian air spry to Hermes shampoo"" . PS the prices are suitable to the place and to offer even if very high !!","4","2016-08"
"wowww","what a hotel
very luxurios
amazing
fantastic
modern really very perfect....
feels like a king and queen...
  Staying in this hotel is really one of a kind, imagination is the best thing i can do if i want to see good things
but this hotel Burj Al Arab is more than imagination...
really great hotel/./","5","2016-08"
"Junsui Restaurant","In the Dubai world of excess, it's good to know that in the only 7 star hotel in the world, there is a sense of normality specialising in exquisite Asian food. The buffet format might put a lot of people off unnecessarily but stick with as the whole culinary experience is worth it. Great for a special occasion.","5","2016-07"
"Afternoon tea","This place is fabulous, four of us books for afternoon tea, it was perfect.. the waiters are fantastic, everyone is treated the same whether you arrive in a Ferrari or a mini bus, its the most ornate place but still lovely. Had a lovely afternoon, you are not rushed at all. Would definitely recommend, it is not cheap but worth it for the experience. Even the lads enjoyed it, never to be forgotten..","5","2016-08"
"Afternoon tea","Whilst I could only ever dream of staying here, afternoon tea was an ""affordable"" option at around £120.00 which included a glass of Champagne. We spent an enjoyable afternoon tea here which was unhurried and an amazing experience. We could have as much of everything as we wanted, which included an extensive choice of teas and mock cocktails included in the price. However, extra Champagne came at extra cost which we declined and stuck to the one glass that came with our tea. It was Mother's Day on the day of our visit, and we were given a small bottle of Hermes perfume as a gift which was a nice touch. 
After our tea, we had time to wander round the public areas in this fascinating building. At no time did we feel that we had to rush out of there, and we took our time visiting the fabulous jewellery shops gazing at fine jewels we could never afford! 
I would happily recommend a visit to this iconic hotel if you're lucky enough to be in Dubai, if only for afternoon tea as we did!","5","2016-03"
"Fantastic","I was very impressed by what I saw in Dubai ! It is another world , if everything is drawn with pencil on paper ! every thing is in place, people are warm , hospitable ! very good food !everything is superlative ! He will return to Dubai at the first opportunity !","5","2015-09"
"Birthday High Tea","I was treated by my husband to the afternoon tea which other than staying in this 7 star hotel was a cheaper way to take in our own little piece of decadence. We were there for 2 hours and the service, food and atmosphere was stunning. We arrived around half an hour early and were checked at the check point for our confirmation number and were let through to take in this very beautifully decorated foyer. The water fall and gold ceilings were breathtaking. Well worth the 250aed to enjoy the views of the 27th floor. I was also given a beautiful red rose and my own birthday cake. Really memorable and a must see.","5","2016-08"
"7* and more","A return visit to Burj al Arab reminded us of why this stunning Jumeirah property retains its 7* rating. The quality of service, food and facilities are unequalled.  The new terrace offers two extra pools - one fresh water and one sea water which is a. Infinity pool with only the beautiful sea ahead of you. The sand is amazing as it does not stick to your wet feet. There are cabanas for every taste and this addition makes the hotel a complete resort.","5","2016-08"
"Beautiful views and beaches ","Wonderful day out here. Veiw to the beach is amazing. you can enjoy sunset here very clearly. Public beach is nearby here. Had great fun over here. It's a must visit place in dubai. Also you can see palm Jumeirah from here ","5","2016-05"
"Dining Experience","My wife and I went to the Burj for the tasting menu. It was a very good insight into one of the world's top hotels. All of the staff were excellent and the dining experience was a good one. Although we have eaten better food the overall atmosphere was very good and I would recommend it.","4","2016-08"
"Unbelievable ","Unbelievable place with the best service ever! The property have been expanded with additional swimming pool, terrace, restaurant and cabanas! Service provided to the hotel guests are the highest! Anything and anytime, which ever you wish! Definitely 7 star hotel. Must see and must be! Unforgettable moments!","5","2016-06"
"Amazing","Me my husband and my mother in law went to the burj al Arab for afternoon tea.the service we received was amazing the staff could do no more for us.when we arrived we were taken to our table and received champagne the view was out of this world.it was a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.we received a 7 course tea.i would highly recommend the burj al Arab and will definitely be back","5","2016-07"
"Dinning in the only 7 star restaurant in the world ","There is nothing that I could fault from the moment we walked in the door until the time we left. Attention to detail was superb and the meal was fabulous. One of the best dining experiences ever. 

It isn't cheap so don't expect to come away with much change from £500 but Included three courses and drinks with exceptional service.","5","2016-08"
"Overall a pleasant experience. Your standard luxury 5 star at an exceptional location","A very pleasant experience overall. The location, building and service are all great but I still do not understand the hype created around this place. To call it a seven star is a bit much.. The decor inside bordered on tacky..stuck in late 90s. Pretty much a similar experience to any other luxury 5 star hotel. Would recommend. Although, not the best option if you are a foodie.
(Visited in late 2000s)","4","2015-10"
"Great Weekend","What can you say, landed at 08:30, picked up at the air bridge and whooshed through the airport, out to the car and straight off to the hotel. A cold towel and a date and up to our suite for check in.
Nothing much has changed in the hotel, but Al Mahara was not open, some bloke called Outlaw is doing it up, just a pity we couldn’t try his food. I assume the experience in the lift will no longer be available, but then it was quite often out of order. Quite amazed how over the years the rooms haven’t changed, still very bling with a feel that you are the first to use them. Always look new!
All the staff no matter where you are in the hotel are excellent, happy, smiling and always have time for a quick chat with guests. Basically the seamless service allows guests to enjoy the facilities to the full. The Butler booked lunch in Junsui and escorted there. We were guided through the menu by an enthusiastic staff member who provided us with all his favourites. A really memorable lunch with dishes to savour. 
Scape for dinner was another great experience, a relaxed informal atmosphere and again very attentive staff happy and helpful serving great food – a must try.
Bab Al Yam for breakfast, it has been remodelled and that is good. Again staff there are ready to help and the food selection as good as ever.
Al Muntaha, food as good as I remember. Two dinner visits, different staff, same high standard of service. Meant to call in to Gold on our way back to the room, but the Skyview Bar seemed to stop us.
The Terrace is a great addition with two new pools and various sitting areas and two bars, one swim up under the bridge. It was very hot, so we walked around a couple of times and did sit at the bar for a sundowner cocktail, but retreated to the cool hotel and the better views. All very relaxed and again plenty of staff to help. Before the visit I thought the cabanas would be a good idea, but sitting in an air conditioned box with a TV didn’t really appeal when we got there. 
It is like a few hotels we stay in around the world where the staff go that extra mile, they are happy to see you and seem to genuinely enjoy looking after you. No complaints, just a great weekend.","5","2016-07"
"Indulgent","Visited family in Dubai and went for afternoon tea at Burj all Arab. 
Worth every single penny sheer luxury, plenty to drink and eat, waiter attentive .
Would most definitely visit again.
Ended up with about 10 courses of delicious food.","5","2016-03"
"the only 7 stars hotel, well deserved.","Designed in 1993, the hotel was ready end of 1999. All material used to build the hotel was of such a high quality that very little refurbishing was necessary. Nothing about this hotel is ordinary. There are no rooms, but only duplex apartments: spacious office, lounge, sitting room, dining table, bathroom, and, on the upper level of each apartment, the big bedroom, huge bathroom with all luxurious necessities, and spacious dressing cabinet. Visibility from the apartment, floating above the sea, is excellent.

The furniture style is the French early 20th century kitch. You might like its aesthetics or not, but the quality and comfort are top. All amenities are there. Every single detail has been thought of for your comfort, from lighting and electric shutters to the TV set raising up from behind the chest of drawers when you press a button.
This is without speaking of the Presidential suite of more than 600m2 and the Royal suite with more than 700m2.

On every floor, the design is such that the butler is always at a desk near to your door, and always available from check in and out to a tour of the facility (restaurants, bars, gyms, swimming pools, etc.), like the one Gautam kindly and efficiently took us for . The Wild Wadi, a water amusement park, is part of the facility. One of the swimming pools is with salt water, facing the sea, with a pleasant endless border.

It is a unique experience in a unique location in the sea. If one has to find something to criticise, I would say that the food, excepting breakfast, is not up to the level of the rest (do not order the gnocchi from the room service).","5","2016-08"
"Losing a little luster ??","Great experience and a lot of high quality touches which is still up there with the best in the world.
Unusually, this stay in the Burj was not as amazing as it has been in the past.
We hired a 2 bed suite as we were hosting a few friends children for a birthday meal during the day.
Security tightened more than previous visits so the check in was problematic due to IDs being required for all guests whether they were staying or not. Not a problem if you know about this in advance which we didn't.
Lots of issues around valet parking as guests had to wait quite some time... unusual compared to before.
A few maintenance issues uncommon for the Burj eg carpeting worn. 
The new deck is a great touch. Much better that the tiny area they had before. Although it had only been opened at that stage for 1 week it already had lots of loose screws and rust around the edges. 
Still fun though expensive and worth a visit. There are now similar experiences available for a lot less money  in Dubai and Sadiyaat, although without the brand appeal.","5","2016-06"
"Luxury as usual..","I have spent one day on the new extended terrace pool which was really amazing and not really easy to find a place like that in Dubai. Such a facilities which has been added to the most luxurious hotel in the world. I cannot say more except encouraging you to experience it and feel the difference.","5","2016-08"
"Afternoon tea","This was my treat on holiday. Wow it was so lovely. Beautiful experience staff friendly and lovely. Afternoon tea was lovely altho I didn't like the truffle base sandwich but that's my preference. What an amazing building. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would do again. Great touch that our guide knew was for hubby's birthday too n they brought little cake with candle n sang happy birthday fab. ","5","2016-07"
"OUTSTANDING ! With no doubt, stay there !","It was my third time at BAA and I cannot still help waiting for my next stay at this most outstanding place. This is not a hotel, it is so much more than that: from the entrance to your suite, everything is so amazing. Even if the decor is not your taste, you cannot imagine anything in the world like this place. But all in all, service is second to none. People do not serve you, they take care at you. They do not treat you as a very important client as you were a star or a royalty, they treat you as if you are the ONE. They cannot do anything less than try to please you, to give you anything you could need on earth, just ask, and it will be done. Should you have any problem ? They will do the best to solve it. Should you have any question ? They will do anything to give you the answer. Just try it ! I did. Not on purpose, but because I needed it. And guess what : they did. On my diner the day before my check in, at Junsui restaurant (you must eat there as their other restaurants, so yummy). The manager himself came to greet me and asked if anything could be done for my pleasure. I was confronted to a very personal issue (not related to the restaurant nor the BAA) but he was so friendly and kind that I felt that I could trust him. I was so right to do so, and told him the full story : he sent me his own manager who listened carefully and she, with a couple of other managers on duty, solved my problem with nothing more than : just let us take care about this. And everything was solved within 2 hours! Nothing is a problem, there is always a solution for you. Whatever it may be or cost it. BAA is not a hotel, it is YOUR HOME. 
Well, as long as you can afford it, yes. But hey, you stay in the only 7 stars hotel in the world... And it is completely true. Just close your eyes, trust them, and... ENJOY!!! Whaowwwwww !!! Thank you BAA !","5","2015-10"
"Excellent Experience at High Tea .","We have always wanted to experience High Tea at the Burj Al Arab. Along with our friends we had High Tea whilst in Dubai recently.  We had a great time and well worth the cost, the service was excellent and we were not able to finish all goodies provided. this is a once in a life time experience for most and we would recommend it as a special treat to all.","5","2016-07"
"Loved it ","Excellent view and weather...great for pictures and time to relax. It was a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Not too busy and family friendly. I would recommend this to friends and families to visit. The sand was lovely and warm under my toes with the water cool and refreshing. ","5","2016-07"
"Talise Spa ","What a wonderful way to start your holiday! My partner bought me the Arabian journey package for my birthday. We both enjoyed the scrub and the massage. All the staff were lovely and welcoming. Bianca give me my treatment, the best massage I've ever had. Left feeling so relaxed and my skin felt amazing! We enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi afterwards. Highly recommend starting your holiday this way! ","5","2016-08"
"Hilarious and Completely Over the Top ","Gold is the predominant color you will experience as soon as entering the property. The rooms' design is completely overloaded with everything one might consider expensive - and the style is catering Russian and Middle East as well as Chinese guests, not so much the European or US flavor of how to decorate a room. But the luxury is - this is fair to say - accompanied with perfect service managed by some of the best industry experts in the world that know how to run a Luxury hotel. So: once in a lifetime you should see that for yourself. It will be an experience. ","5","2016-04"
"Evening Tea at the Burj, great way to visit a stunning hotel","Visiting the Burj Al Arab has been a dream of mine for the last few years.  However, I always knew that staying at the hotel was not an affordable dream.  As well, I did find out that another way to visit the hotel was to either make dinner reservations or Tea reservations at the hotel to be able to visit and see the amazing architecture. 

I made reservations for evening tea a few months in advance. Initially I wondered if the 140 (CDN) would be worth the price but I decided that was more affordable than actually staying at the hotel. LOL 

From the moment you get to the gate in your taxi ( from where you can ONLY enter if you have reservations) you are in awe of the hotel and the fact that it is on it's own island in the Arabian sea.  ","5","2016-08"
"Skyview bar for those who can afford it! ","Going into the Burj Al Arab has been on our bucket list for some time. So we booked for cocktails at the Skyview Bar at sunset. Minimum spend AED350 each. 
The building itself is astonishing! So overdone and decadent. 
We had a beautiful view from our table. The presentation of the food and drinks was impeccable - having allergies I was presented with a fresh berry cocktail. Super impressive. 
I started off with a cocktail and finished off with Johnnie Walker Blue. 
The service was excellent, the bar was spotless and the entire experience was worth the spend. It was also lovely to see the sunset over the water and watch the Burj light up after nightfall. 
Bottom line: overpriced but once in a lifetime and semi formal attire in 44 degree heat was a bit of a struggle! Super glad we did it. Bucket list - tick. ","4","2016-08"
"Worth every star! Especially because of the service!!!","After hearing a lot about this property and the reputation it up holds you really do expect a lot...especially due to the price, but I can honestly say it's worth every penny! 
The rooms out of this world (whilst really not my taste it somehow works!) although some of the facilities could be upgraded (they even have a vhs system) it has everything and more than you could ever want or need! 
Breakfast is incredible (best room service I've ever tried) 
But the main thing that made this stay were the staff! It's literally the hotel of happiness!!!! All the butlers on the 15th floor were impeccable and just so friendly but even the cleaning staff hovering the carpets made you feel 7 star with their big smile and genuine warm manner! The pool staff were INCREDIBLE!! We stayed at the salt pool and all the guys were just amazing!!!! Funny, chatty, polite and just made you feel like the only guest there! One gentleman who's name I can't remember had only been at the property for 4 months after completing his training at madinat was just great! For someone so new he was attentive and even got us a cake after mentioning it was a birthday! Remembered us the next day made a point to say hello! Just amazing!! Hotels like Emirates palace could learn a lot from you guys! Literally can't say enough about the fantastic service, and honestly they made the stay and just put you in an instant good mood (although in the burj it's hard to be blue) 
The new pool fantastic! Literally just nothing bad to say! ","5","2016-08"
"Culinary flight, do it, put it on bucket list","Just wonderful, but service alone makes it worth it. Like a previous reviewer we are from the hospitality industry and we are so glad we were not put off by their review,
let me walk you through our experience,
Arrived in normal taxi, security found our details from their numerous sheets quickly and efficiently and we were waved through to proceed over bridge to hotel entrance.
On arrival, EVERY, member of staff greeted us warmly and guided us through and we were directed to our culinary flight reception. we arrived 10minutes early and suggestions were made for us to fill our time and where to take photos. At 1850 allocated our first host who guided us to the top floor bar, given menus and canapes and drinks while we chose. Every member of staff knew our name and when we had only half finished our canapes they were completely refreshed. we were then guided to the French restaurant where we had chilled asparagus soup, slowly stewed octopus and crab, all good, not michelin star, but good and my gluten intolerance was well catered for. Wine list extensive but priced ridiculously, 85 pounds for the cheapest red wine on the menu which even Asda's would reject. However I was upfront about wanting the cheapest wine since they had no unwooded australian chardonay or red Chinon, and the sommilier made us feel very comfortable and valued, ( he trained in uk and france). We went with it as we had decided to treat ourselves but clearly in the wine department money does not buy taste in the Burj al Arab. I needed to visit the ladies and was escorted there and on the way engaged in conversation by staff who have been trained to an exceptional standard.  On to next restaurant, turbot, turbot and lamb soup, again unremarkable, food wise but service, attention and environment great. Next restaurant Japanese, food very good, exceptional wagyuy beef and again my gluten free needs well catered for. Saki menu good and knowledgable staff but prices silly, 175 for 180ml of Saki, however charm of waiters and could forgive. One waiter of special mention who was treated appallingly by rude customers but he remained unfazed and did not show any annoyance or upset, an absolute credit to the Burj.  Next pudding in the Atrium, again superb staff, Paris brest as good as in Paris, black forest gateaux good, not traditional and surprising, fruit plate for me as gluten intolerate bit boring and would have expected something better. Coffee and tea good and flowers for the lady at the end, nice touch. Total cost for 3 with terrible bottle of red wine but good Saki 850 pounds. Was it worth it? For food and drink no, but for overall experience yes, yes, yes. Staff exceptional and planning, environment and execution very very good.","5","2016-08"
"Drinks at the Al Arab","Went for drinks with some family that stays in dubai, the staff were amazing helpful and attentive, the drinks were fabulous and well prepared, we had an awesome time and with a great scenic view of the coast!","5","2015-09"
"Best among the Best - the second stayed ","This is an incredibly beautiful building. The detail in the decoration of the hotel is breathtaking. Although the restaurant is very exclusive, the staff are very engaging and it's easy to just relax and enjoy your meal. Must try the newly opened bar at the 27th floor ( gold on 27) the demise in the donkey and the Pickering bomb must try ! ","5","2016-08"
"Much better than we expected, and we expected a lot!","Just finished a fantastic stay at the magnificent 7 Star Burj Al Arab and was really sad to have to leave. 

The hotel is visually impressive inside and out but the real stars of the show are the staff. They were friendly, attentive and very respectful of our space and time. They seriously could not do enough for us and catered for our every need. 

The pillow menu has to seen to be believed and our son Henry made the very most of it. We loved the Talise Spa and amazing pool on the 18th floor has great views and serene atmosphere. 

The new terrace is great, quiet and refined with fresh and saltwater pools, jacuzzis and a cool bar. The cocktail menu is fun, and the food was as good as you would expect. 

A totally fantastic stay, planned to be a once in a lifetime event, but I think we'll be back!","5","2016-08"
"Out of this world, an unforgettable stay ","Stayed here for two nights with my husband, 6 year old daughter and 6 month old son as part of our family holiday to Dubai, specially celebrating our 10 year anniversary. From the moment we entered to the moment we left we were enveloped in luxury and amazing client service. There were reception desks on every floor to address your every need (your mind practically read by the staff before those needs arose!) and our room came with breakfast and an evening drinks service from our personal butler. He made it his business to cater to every single need and remember our preferences. The suites are outstanding with beautiful views. I'm convinced the staff went above and beyond (even more than usual) to make our stay a special one due to our anniversary. We were given a beautiful room with amazing views and staff wished us happy anniversary when they saw us. We were presented with lots of anniversary gifts from the hotel and our room came ready prepared with baby equipment such as a high chair steriliser and bottle warmer, not to mention gifts for the baby. We enjoyed using our in-suite hot tub and having the gorgeous luxurious Talise spa to ourselves. Turndown service was impeccable and staff always made such a fuss over our children. Breakfast in the poolside terrace restaurant was an amazing experience just in itself-the quality, the variety and the impeccable service. Needless to say the in room facilities and technology were amazingly luxurious and advanced. On our anniversary we had a lovely late lunch at al Muntaha. The hotel saw to it that we were seen off to our next hotel in style by dismissing our decision to take a buggy and offered us a complimentary bmw 7 series instead. We were seen off by a team of staff and I can honestly say I felt like a celebrity for a couple of days. Many thanks to the wonderful Sudi who looked after us so well. We had amazing times by th gorgeous infinity pool and on the beach where waiters and staff catered to our every whim. We will definitely be back again one day ","5","2016-08"
"A Wonderful Experience","My group of friends and I had cocktails in the bar located on the top of the hotel. It really is a wonderful and unique experience. The cocktails are so very creative with a story behind each one. The sweet tapas is a wonderful tasty treat. The view is amazing as expected, even the journey in the elevator is unique. The staff as one would expect are simply wonderful and welcoming. Everything about the service is flawless.","5","2015-09"
"Not a hotel, an experience!","OK, I don't usually write reviews on TripAdvisor (I have to be very impressed in order to write one) but I felt that I really needed to do that.
This hotel is amazing! I have been in 5 star hotels in Europe, USA and the indian ocean but this tops by far everywhere that I have been before.
To say that Burj Al Arab is a hotel is an understatement! This is a true palace!
First of all, the check in procedure. They check you in your room (I am sorry, suite as the minimum room is a suite) and not in a bustling reception. 
The suite is big (it can easily accommodate a family of five) on two levels and you have a butler 24/7 right out of your door, ready to fulfill your every wish (from booking you a nice restaurant to packing/unpacking your bags etc). 
I need to say a bit more about the service. Your butler can walk you around the resort, he/she can escort you to your restaurant and even come and find you while you relax in the pool to confirm if everything is ok. Our butler, Dasha, was extremely helpful, from confirming our transfer in the airport, to arranging surprise gifts for our five-year old daughter. However, what made me stay in awe, was the following ""incident""
When opening the door to come out of the suite, the door knob broke. As soon as I mentioned it, they had a repair man to fix it within 5 minutes. Also, the service manager came up to apologize personally for this (which is something that can obviously happen anywhere). And if that was not all, they came in the afternoon with a complimentary bottle of wine, snacks and candies and a teddy bear for our five year old. Wow!
The luxury everywhere is impeccable and the new addition to the hotel, the terrace, is just amazing! Not to mention the full size Hermes toiletries that are complimentary. 
I could go on for ages about this palace but anyway.
One last thing, this hotel is definitely not on the cheap side, however you have to trust me on this as what you pay is what you get! It certainly delivers and surely, we will return.","5","2016-08"
"So special","There is no where else like this hotel the Burj could be 10 stars. The arrival is perfect with dates and tea at the door. The suites and butler service is second to none. I was there for business and the butler assisted with all my businesses needs. Thank you so much.","5","2016-02"
"Awesome hotel","The Burj was on my bucket list . We spent 3 night here in July. We stayed in the Panaramic view suite. Walking into the room was awe inspiring, views over the Gulf and the city.
2 floors, reception and sitting  room at the bottom Bedroom up the stairs.
Can't say enough about the butler service on each floor, ask and it's done. Want a seat in the restaurant, taxi calling, hot tub filling! All taken care of.
We had buffet dinner at the local cuisine Al Iwan reasonable price and excellent. Dinner at the Al Muntaha the 27th floor restaurant next to the sky bar also excellent but expensive. Service and views outdo the food, but all in all with drinks at the sky bar to finish a fantastic experience.
What we didn't like - seems like a lot of Asian tourist book day trips to the Asian restaurant for lunch. Far too many selfies going on in the lobby.

"Does it get better?","We stayed here in July and were blown away by everything from the pillow menu to the smart room. Nothing could be faulted. I mentioned my birthday was soon and sure enough our butler comes with a delicious chocolate cake. We dined in the Scape restaurant which also could not be faulted. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay special. The 7 stars speak for themselves.","5","2016-07"
"Love this hotel and it's service","We had a great experience here before, so we were wanted to go back again.  We again stayed in the panoramic room suite and loved it. 

There is not much to say about the Burj al Arab that hasn't been said before as it is the most famous hotel in the world, however, they recently extended the back of it.  There is now a fabulous new Terrace are which includes a new restaurant, pool and cabanas. 

Staying here allows you access to the other Jumeriah Hotels which you can get to by buggy. However, why go anywhere else :) 

The welcome gifts and drinks were nice.  The turndown service always provided little surprise gifts every night.  Great toiletries by Hermes, which made the Mrs happy.

What I loved most about this hotel is the staff.  They are fantastic.  Everyone greeted us by our name and even told us welcome back (which is a nice touch).  I would like to say a big thank you to all of the staff, especially our butlers Uday (always smiling and making us laugh) and Sudi.  Thanks for looking after us in June 2016. See you soon!","5","2016-06"
"Beautiful location, amazing architecture, warm hospitality","Very well managed .. hospitable staff.. Great interiors... Even the lift is exquisite.. Had been there for a lavish breakfast. Enjoyed lots. It was a beautiful spread of indian delicacies.We overate :)","4","2015-12"
"Truly a 7* experience ","To start with this hotel is fantastic and worth every penny. The rooms are spacious and the private butlers provide the best experience and are always there when ever you need something even if it's in the middle of the night. It's located near wild wadi which is awesome because jumeirah guest get a free entry to the water park. The food in this hotel is also amazing and worth the money. I recommend this hotel to people who like to live the luxury life and the lastly the facilities are incredibly out of this world and that's why they are a 7* hotel, I do look forward meeting the staff again in the nearby future! 
","5","2016-06"
"More than perfect","I celebrated my birthday at the restaurant Al Mahara. The way they celebrated with me was fantastic and unforgettable. The food was perfect, the view was unbelievvel with sharks and beautiful fishes around,  and the people there were sooooo lovely and nice, they had flowers for me and a couple or cakes. Thanks a lot Al Mahara, I had and perfect birthday.","5","2016-08"
"Luxury at its best","I've stayed at Burj several times and always it is a memorable experience. This summer they presented a new overwater terrace with two pools (saltwater and freshwater) with warm jacuzzi, comfortable lounge area and a cafe. I've stayed in the beginning of July and freshwater pool was still out of service but saltwater pool and jacuzzi were opened. This terrace is a purely relaxing zone! In the past years the only thing that was upsetting about the hotel was the lack of big comfortable pool and pool area. Now this problem does't exist. 
This time I was traveling with my little daughter and upon arriving I found in the room all baby amenities that I needed: baby bath amenities, bathrobe, slippers, Burj Al Arab teddy bear as a gift and of course small baby gifts every evening. What my daughter liked most of all was a big toy train which the butler brought every evening: it was full of sweets (marshmallows, chocolates and all that stuff) and my daugher could take everything she wanted.
At the hotel they also renovated the Bab Al Yam restaurant which has become much more cozy and delicious as they got a new chef.
Surely I'll be back  and highly recommend! This hotel is a must!!!","5","2016-07"
"Luxury treatment ","This place is incredible. The interior and exterior as well. I didn't know where to look first. Like it very much! My recommend is to spend one afternoon in the bar in lobby, and you can try fondue and to enjoy in the sounds of piano. You will feel like really royal!","5","2015-10"
"LOVELY EXPERIENCE","I have been here last year, this place is stunning, glamorous, piece of art, beautiful, views are amazing, best service so far. Make sure you book in advance to get a place. Thanks!, highly recommend it.","5","2015-10"
"THE PLACE TO STAY IN DUBAI!!!","During a recent trip to Kenya in March 2016, on the way back home to the US, we stayed at the Burj Al Arab.  Where do I begin.....from the time we arrived at the gate, we where greeted with a sincere welcome.  Once we arrived at the front door, we where greeted by our names as they opened the car door. They escorted us to our room, where they completed the check in process. The staff was so nice, friendly and warm.  Once she left the room, we started to tour the hotel, and words cannot express just how beautiful this place is.  I can go on and on...but I'll let the photos speak for themselves.  I have to give a special thanks to  Guest Service Manager Andra Vachente for makings sure our stay was extra special and also to Assistant Transportation Manager - Brian Munyuku, for finding us and letting us know that our room came with a driver to and from the mall.  We cannot WAIT to return to this hotel.","5","2016-03"
"Appalling food in restaurant","Stayed here for my husband's 50th birthday party as a one off experience as we normally stay at Dar Al Masyaf, where food and service is amazing. The hotel is beautiful, service is second to none rooms are amazing. However, on the first night we dined in Bab Al Yam, noting there were only 2 other guests. The beef was raw the chicken wasn't hot, noting this is a buffet style restaurant. I had severe sickness and diarrhoea approximately 8 hours later which continued for the majority of the next day. I did not consume any other food during my stay. On the 3rd and final night, my husband ate at Bab Al Yam, again the chicken wasn't hot and the fish was raw in the middle. He then suffered the same sickness as myself. These issues were raised when we were there, the Butler even brought a get well card to the room. Because of this, noting our stay was only 3 nights, we did not leave the hotel and spent most of the time being sick. We have travelled to Dubai many times over the years, at the same time of the year and have never had any issues at all, drinking plenty of water and noting that it was only after the food that we were ill, it was not a sickness which we had prior to having the food at Bab Al Yam. On our return, the hotel asked us to have tests with the doctors, which we did, noting this was 5 days later, with our GP advising that there would be no trace of anything in our system. Because of this, the outcome from the management at the Burj was that nothing could be proven, even though a recent review on trip advisor, points to the food at Bab Al Yam. We were offered a free return meal, for which we obviously declined for the above reasons, hence we had our monies returned for the Pepsi's and coffee purchased at Bab Al Yam.
This is the only 7* hotel in the world, its surroundings, location and butler's are second to none. However, one would think that they would offer more than a meal or a refund of a couple of soft drinks, when £4,000 was spent to go there for this special occasion and absolutely ruined by the food. I have left putting a review on until now as emailed the hotel manager and the PR manager to see if they wanted to come back to me with their comments, before I wrote this. They have decided to ignore my emails, which unfortunately just goes to prove that their duty of care and the want of repeat business is completely missing.","1","2016-06"
"great place to take photos","Burj Al Arab is one of the must see places in dubai. its right next to the ocean. i would recommend going there early morning or late in the afternoon. depending on the time you travel the extreme hot weather might force you to visit there right before sunset.","5","2016-03"
"Burj al Arab Jumeira","You will love walking along the shore with white sands or taking a swim in the clean blue waters at Jumeira beach along with the spectacular view of the Burj Al Arab Hotel. Its a place to visit...If you are into water sports like Jet Skiing or Surfing then Dubai is the place for you.","5","2016-03"
"Wow","The best words I could use to describe most of Dubai (and I've been there now a half dozen times for intervals between 24 hours and 7 days) would be ""Extravagance Beyond Comprehension"".  This hotel just takes that to the highest possible level; I've stayed all over the world and this was one of the few times I found myself saying ""you are waaaaaay out of your league right now buddy"".  If you have the cash it's certainly a bucket-list worthy event to stay here at least one night... I would also suggest forking out the extra $200pp to do the Friday Brunch if it's in season, really a great time!  

The hotel is other-worldly; you'll never feel like something was cut to save money or made to be more practical anywhere.  There are plenty of times where you're like, is that gold? Omg that's gold!  And the service, you'll be pampered to an extent that is tough to find anywhere in the western world.  You want something in a very specific way, ask for it, they will definitely get it for you.  

One bit of advice for the would-be traveler, pack some nice clothes.  I was rather limited on options when I passed through here the first time and got tons of dirty looks for wearing shorts and a polo through the lobby.  Pants and a button up shirt seem to be the minimum expectation unless you're out for a swim.","5","2015-09"
"The exclusive journey","Everytime we come back here is always a beautiful experience. There is no hotel like Burji Al Arab. From the magnificent rooms, to the confortable materass, the excellent service. And now with the last upgrade the infinity pool is just fabulous. Everything is just perfect. Many thanks to all the staff for our beautiful stay.","5","2016-07"
"Amazing Place","What more is there to say........ Faultless ! 
My wife & I stayed here for a week on 2007 as part of our honeymoon. We stayed in a Panoramic Suite with amazing views in land over the Jumeirah Beach hotel, absolutely every whim is catered for by your personal butler.","5","2016-07"
"The inside of the hotel is beautiful","My wife and I could not afford the $1,200 per night. The only other way to get into the hotel is go there for dinner.  There is a gate to prevent people from just walking into the hotel. They checked to see that we had a dinner reservation. We went early enough to scope out the luxurious reception area and to visit the shops.  It was Thanksgiving week and there were lots of Christmas trees on the main stairway to the second level.

The dinner was excellent. The restaurant was on top of the hotel and we had a great view of the area around the hotel.","4","2015-11"
"Skyview Bar","7 Star hotel for a reason.   In short amazing experience.  Service was exceptional and food was exquisite.  From the minute they welcome you at the hotel entrance they pamper you with hot towels and treats.  Everyone has a smile and treat you like a king and queen.","5","2016-07"
"Awesome Architecture","This is one of the most expensive hotel around the world. The Concept of this hotel is pretty much awesome! Its like a boat sailing in the ocean.! Thumbs up to Atkins Company, led by Architect Tom Wright.","5","2015-08"
"Family outing","Un usual building that even after 15 years in service appears new and unique. Member of the project team that delivered the hotel, always enjoy visits with small extra at this property that offers ultimate luxury. Food at the Sky restaurants is just special, SPA has specific charm, rooms are really unique, coffee shops at the lobby serving the best Umm Ali.","5","2015-12"
"Iconic View","This is one of the best hotel I have ever stayed in. We love that everything is so unique and magnificent. We love the luxurious room and the ocean view and most of all, it is an easy access to the beach. You have to try the restaurant with the fish tank called Al Maraha! We have the best seafood there! 
If I could go back to Dubai again, I would definitely stay there. If you want to have a fancy gateway this is the place to be. Food, view, and people are just amazing here.","5","2015-10"
"WE SAY 8 STAR!","This Hotel is simply amazing! From the moment my partner and I arrived to the time we had to leave, we were treated like royalty!
We arrived at 8am and were given an early check in at no extra charge. 
Once in our room, which was spread out over 2 levels!! the luxury continued - we were given a his and hers bottles of Hermes Eau Der Toilette plus other luxuries each night, also the gorgeous bottle of red wine and endless choices of fresh fruit.
The bedding was nothing like I've ever slept in before with luxurious thread count sheets and huge pillows with even a pillow menu! 
All the hotel staff made us feel so welcome and would go above and beyond to ensure our comfort was of the highest. We were never made to feel that anything was too much to ask. The floor butlers opening your room on every return, to the bar staff in the pool bar having a laugh and being genuinely happy - we would like to make a special acknowledgement to Paul in the pool side bar for adding that bit extra to our visit, this guy is a huge asset to the Burj staff. 
A thank you also to the French staff lady in Customer Services (sorry we've forgotten her name) for allowing us to have full use of a private pool side lounge for the afternoon on our last day at no extra charge. Thank you so much! 
The food at the Burj is incredible although things can appear to be on the higher side of price, however you get what you pay for and we will do it all over again.
The 'WOW' in wow factor ********
Trip advisor needs more stars for a Hotel of this calibre.","5","2016-07"
"Dream afternoon tea ","Visited the sky view bar after easily pre booking via email ( you can't enter the hotel without a booking) for the 1 pm afternoon setting as we wanted to avoid the sun and see it clearly !

We arrived early to get a window seat which we did and it was so worth it! Stunning views all around. 

Afternoon tea was expensive - around £130 each. Worth it? Yes !! It was a real experience and the service was ridiculously good. It was a 7 course extravaganza with unlimited sandwiches, drinks and cakes. They also brought us a birthday cake and rose ! 

Each course was explained to us and was a very high quality. Everything was superb and you were not rushed! Amazing X ","5","2016-07"
"Summer Hot","I would like to thank the young lady cart driver who pick us up along the way while walking to Al Mahara under the heat of the sun. Though i forgot to take her name, she was very helpful, she even guided us to the restaurant. One thing iam concerned of about her health, isn't that it is not allowed to work outdoors from 12nn to 3pm under the excruciating heat of the sun?.  This kind of worker should be rewarded. Thanks!","4","2016-07"
"Breathtaking","A truly wonderful experience. James bond moments. Duplex suite. Didn't need the butler service. Top dining at top prices. 'Submarine, to the fish restaurant a bit odd. Cocktail bat fab. Beach clean with good facilities.","5","2015-12"
"The most amazing dinner ever!","My wife and I availed of the culinary flight at the Burj Al Arab and can confirm that the experience from arrival in the lobby to returning to our hotel was truly exceptional and world class.

We really were treated like royalty, it was as if each restaurant, where we had one course of food each, was trying to out do the previous restaurant. 

We were visited at the table by all service staff in each restaurant and the chefs even popped out and spoke with us to see how the amazing food they had served us was.

Dining here is truly a once in a life time experience, I have dined at many three star Michelin restaurants throughout the world and would whole heartedly recommend to any foodie visiting or staying in Dubai to avail of the culinary flight at the Burj Al Arab!

Special thanks go to the entire F&B team and in particular Teresa and Tracey, thank you so much for taking great care of us on our return to Dubai, where we met one another some thirty years ago!","5","2016-06"
"Fanciest hotel in the world!","The place is very exotic! Staff is extremely nice and polite! Of course is a pricey place ,7 stars are not for free. Food is delicious and very well presented. Thumbs up for the staff, the food and the ambience.","5","2016-01"
"Be aware of costs","We thought we would take a taxi to just look at the building from the outside and on arrival were made aware that you must have a booking for the restaurant to get inside the locked and guarded compound! There is also a minimum spend which is actually very pricey. Recommend that if you just want appreciate the architecture and take a photo or two of the outside, go to the beach instead.","2","2016-07"
"One of the best hotels I've visited","I was not staying at the Burj Al Arab, but I visited a friend of mine there and I have to say that they have a little bit better service than the Marriott, on the other side less conditions and privacy.","5","2016-06"
"Fantastic experiance","Visited hotel for the second time, absolutely fantastic, took our 19year old son this visit he was bowled over. Food & service is brilliant totally looked after.  Some people may not like the tentative attention, but you have to try this at least once. ","5","2016-05"
"The best in the world!!!","Stayed here two nights, Wow what a place. Be sure to sweet talk the staff into letting you on the heliport to take pictures. The staff is great and friendly to serve your every need. Be sure to try the Scape Restaurant and bar.","5","2016-05"
"A flag of Dubai","Since I visit Dubai it was a must to visit this iconic building. Everything is beautiful from the entrance till upstairs from the rooms. Gold everywhere. Staff in the entrance very welcomed but after that not so.","3","2016-07"
"Very Good overall, With Some Problems....","It is difficult to describe the Burj Al Arab without using too many superlatives. 
Yes, it is grand. 
Yes there is a profusion of bling bling.
So instead of writing a novel about our experience there, here are some simple pros and cons: 

PROS: Mostly excellent service throughout the hotel. Amazing suites. Crazy views from the room. Superbly appointed and best-in-the-world amenities. The new infinity pool is beautiful. The staff are extremely kind and know you (and your kids) by name.  The arrival of the sweets/candy train at 17:00 was awesome for the kids. With the exception of the pillows, the furniture was fantastically comfortable. Did I mention the views? Out of this world. 

CONS: 
(a) The main pool on the new deck was strangely CLOSED due to an 'emergency'. Considering the cost of the stay I would have hoped that the reservation staff would have (a) Informed us in advance (b) offered some form of compensation. We were left with one very small sweet water pool and the - albeit beautiful - salt water infinity pool. Whilst we did have access to Wild Wadi we didn't fancy sweating it out in slide queues and thus stayed within the hotel grounds. 
(b) It took ages to get a pool cabana secured even though there was hardly anyone there. The cabana wasn't ready on arrival. The A/C inside the cabana didn't work particularly well. There was no draft beer at the pool (the machine was 'broken' apparently). 
(c) There was no high chair in the room, no cot, and no spare bed for our eldest upon arrival. You can't help but think someone missed a trick there. 
(d) Again obtaining a high chair for room service was a chore. The dining table wasn't cleaned after clearing. 
(e) The view at breakfast and the kindness of the staff made up for an uninspiring buffet arrangement. 

You might think I'm picky - and you're entitled to your opinion of course - but for a hotel that professes to be 'The only 7 Start Hotel In The World' I think my concerns are justified. 

Overall we had a fantastic stay and will certainly stay again - but we'll definitely enjoy it more if the points above are addressed.","4","2016-07"
"Amazing doesn't cover it ","MIND BLOWEN ! staff amazing views amazing just a perfect way to top a perfect holiday if there is one thing you do before you die try Dubai and sleep here ! Worth every penny thank you for making the holiday so easy and effortless we will definitely be returning ","5","2016-03"
"Great experience","If you can afford it, try it. Caviar, champagne, service is all Excellent. The view is magnificent and The atmosphere is very very luxurious. We had a four Course menu and all dishes where at its best and The touch was absolutely amazing. One time, one experience. ","5","2016-01"
"Food was great ambiance lacking","Ok, well this is the Burj Al Arab folks and I only gave it three stars and not seven. We at at the lesser expensive restaurant which still was quite expensive, water and one Pepsi amounting to $50. And although the food was great, the ambiance was lacking. The options were to sit in a smoke-filled interior or sit poolside. Nothing particular seven star about eating poolside (except the price). The other restaurant might have been better but cost is outrageous and food selection not particularly extensive.

I know you can't eat ambiance but for those prices, I would like to soak in an atmosphere a little more sophisticated. If I hadn't prepaid for dinner, I might have walked out.","3","2016-04"
"Very nice hotel!","I stayed here for 10 nights and the room was really nice. The staff is very nice and polite and the hotel has a lot of amenities. The hotel is right on the edge of the water so it has lots of views of the ocean.","5","2016-01"
"Ultimate luxury","The best brunch ever.
Skyview restaurant was most memorable, with spectacular view of the city skyline.
Captivating experience from the moment you get there until you leave.
Views over downtown was amazingly beautiful. Spectacular building.
The food, the drink and the staff were fantastic.
We sat long and enjoyed the delicious food, the drink and amazing views.
They had literally all kind of food. Nothing were missing. 
Magnificent experience.
If you go to Dubai, you have to experience the best of the best.","5","2016-04"
"Another wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel","Arrived early morning 4th June, having been collected from the airport in a beautiful car with chauffeur. Our room wasn't ready as they had almost 100% occupancy the previous night. We were given access to the Presidential Suite until our room was ready, wow wow wow, unbelievable size with amazing sitting rooms etc.

Our room was ready at 4pm and we were escorted to our suite which was lovely.

Booked a meal in Junsui, specialising in Far East Asia food, it was wonderful food and very attentive staff.

Also dined in Al Iwan which offers sumptuous Arabic food in spectacular surroundings.

The Terrace had opened the previous week and it is a great addition to the hotel.  Rented a cabana for a day which was a welcome relief from the 100 degree heat.

I would like to mention Alaa who was Duty Manager when we were there and Niranjan who was Room Service Manager, he dealt with an issue we had and resolved it in a very professional way.

Can't praise all staff enough, nothing is too much trouble, hope to be back asap","5","2016-06"
"An Experience","Stayed at the Burj for 2 nights after a month in Europe on the way back home to Australia. What a way to end an amazing global trip. This Hotel in every detail is perfect. Butlers, amazing room and all the facilities you need. I look forward to returning to the new beach club that was opening the day we left! Sounds like a good reason to return, see you soon","5","2016-06"
"The best hotel in the world","This is the best hotel in the world!
Thanks so much for everything. 
The staff was amazing and the rooms are so clean and comfy! 
We will be back next year :)
Great management guys! 
We have been in  a lot of hotels all over the world but this hotel is one of our favorite

"Afternoon tea with NO view!!!!","We booked to have afternoon tea last week as part of an excursion and have to say we were very underwhelmed. It was a bucket list treat and was such a huge disappointment. We were herded into an area where we all sat together (no privacy), ....we had been promised the sky bar but this did not happen. The food was ok, but just ok. I could see nothing that deserved a 7 star rating...... Preferred our own hotel. What a shame!!","3","2016-06"
"Afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab Skyview","Beautiful experience to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. Stunning views, a real treat, looked after to a high standard by our waiter.
Lovely champagne afternoon tea, despite it being Ramadan and daylight hours (4pm) we were still served with alcohol.
Generous 7 course afternoon tea with servings of sandwiches, tea & pastries. 
Lovely to soak up the Burj Atmosphere, the glass elevator up to the sky view worth the reservation!
Received a red rose and an anniversary cake, just perfect!
This experience is a must for that special occasion.","5","2016-06"
"The best","We recently spent 3 nights at the Burj al Arab what an amazing experience it was!!  this was our second visit with me my wife and our 4 year old son, on arrival from airport we were collected by the rolls Royce phantom our check in was in the suite on floor 14 & from start to finish our team of butlers bent over backwards especially for our son! Some May say this is to be expected from a hotel of this grandeur but in our opinion it was very natural and genuinely wanted what was best for us all. The new ""terrace"" is stunning, the perfect touch to complete this amazing hotel. I really do think there should be a separate review page for residents of the hotel and for those who visit for afternoon tea etc as they can't possibly have a true reflection of the service this hotel offers when you stay here. It should be up there in position 1 to match its title of the most luxurious hotel in the world.

We are by no means millionaires nor are we snobs or posh just your normal family who like nice things and never once did we feel out of place here!

Thankyou Burj al Arab for another amazing stay and will look forward to returning for longer next year!","5","2016-06"
"Incredible from start to finish!!","My husband and I stayed here recently for 2 nights as a treat to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary.

Wow, wow, wow!! I knew it was going to be amazing but it surpassed my hopes completely.

On arrival despite being extremely early for check in (8.30am) our room was ready and we were whisked up to our suite on the 21st floor (actually 42nd due to all suites being duplex) to complete the check in process and have a tour of our suite! (A tour really was needed due to the size!!)
The view overlooking Jumeirah beach / the palm and the Burj's new terrace was amazing!!

We found full sized Hermes shampoo/conditioner/shower gel/soaps waiting for us in the bathroom and were also given a Hermes his & hers perfume/aftershave which we able
to take away with us!
(They all smelled amazing!)

We were extremely fortunate that the new terrace had just opened and ""wow"" it really is a fab place! Comfy loungers, two pools (one fresh water the other salt water) a beach area (sand gets ridiculously hot though!!) and so many cabanas (so amazing that you'd be happy to live in one!) we spent most of our time down here as it felt so exclusive & whilst wild wadi was included (you can go there any time whilst I'm Dubai right!) we decided to lap up the experience just relaxing at the hotel.
The staff are all incredible, really friendly and chatty! We loved talking to Paul and Nishrif (Sri Lankan boys as our next stop was actually Sri Lanka!)

We were on a HB rate and decided to eat both nights at Bab al Yam, mainly as the buffet and cooking stations were so nice! We had breakfast one day in Bab al
yam (preferred this) and one day Junsui (Asian restaurant).
Food and staff were brilliant, couldn't fault them!
On our anniversary night the restaurant even presented us with a cake (shame we had already eaten dessert!!) but we took this up to our room in a cute box they provided.

On arrival to our suite the butler then presented us with an anniversary gift & wheeled in another huge cake, a card and a beautiful bouquet of roses!
(FYI - We couldn't eat both cakes during our stay but such a cute gesture!)

The little gifts didn't end there either, turn down each night was something we looked forward to! Not your usual chocolate / bookmark but instead perfume/nail
Files/eye creams/cuticle cream/roses! Just incredible!

We were also granted a complementary late check out so that we could make use of the facilities and freshen up prior to leaving and our butler was extremely flexible.

We loved every single second of our time here! Best anniversary yet!
We hope to return at some stage in the near future & wouldn't hesitate to recommend!

Thank you for everything!","5","2016-06"
"Wow!!!","Just like the rest of Dubai, this place was extraordinary. Only way to visit is to stay or eat. We decided to go for afternoon tea. The sandwich were delicious. Lots of gourmet tea selections and coffee too. Started with a nice bubbly. Included were sweets. We got a souvenir at the end of tea which was a nice touch. From what I understand, you can make reservations at one of restaurants or visit a night club as well. ","5","2015-07"
"Culinary Flight","What a pity that Trip Advisor only allow you score up to 5 stars when commenting on this most extravagant of hotels.Its known as the 7 star hotel, so that's what I'd like to give too.
The only way to see the Burj al Arab is to book a reservation and being in Dubai for several days we decided on the Culinary Flight. Admittedly its expensive by most peoples standards, but if you're prepared to push the boat out for this once in a lifetime experience (though I am considering a return when next in Dubai just to confirm how much we really enjoyed it!) you oughtn't be disappointed.
We were treated like royalty (well, as far as we imagine they're treated) from start to finish. Arriving just before noon we were directed to the appropriate foyer, stopping countless times to take in the décor and our general whereabouts. 
Beginning within an aquarium restaurant we've no idea if we were the only participants of the Culinary Flight or if there were several other parties. We were greeted by name, escorted to our table, fawned over throughout the 1st course, then handed over to the next restaurant supervisor who ushered us into the lift to our next course where we were met by that department head, never crossing paths with other diners.
Of course our main course in the Skyview restaurant was most memorable, with spectacular views towards the Palm & the city skyline and the chance to take numerous photographs.
Finally, once we'd made it known we were ready, we were back where we began on the 1st floor foyer, where dessert followed by tea/coffee was served. After over 5 hours we decided that we'd better leave, though we were constantly made aware that there was no time limit and to enjoy it for as long as we wished.
Altogether, a magnificent experience, with exquisite food, which I'd thoroughly recommend to anyone.
Brilliant from 1st minute to last. 12/10 from me.","5","2016-05"
"Overnight stay in Dubai","The hotel is simply amazing.  Having a two storey ""hotel suite"" was sensational.  The bottle of complimentary wine and all of the toiletries were outstanding.  The butler was so friendly as all the other staff were too.  We loved viewing the adjacent hotel in the buggy and found the local souk most interesting.  We will definitely be back.  We were only sorry to have missed the fabulous fish restaurant as we understand it was being renovated.","5","2016-06"
"Not Just A Hotel, A Destination Not To Be Missed. A Fabulous Adventure.","We always wanted to see Dubai. It was a major item on our bucket list and well, the Burj Al Arab is one of the 2 major icons of Dubai. We thought about taking a tour of the hotel, but figured if we stayed we’d be able to see more. Be sure to watch the YouTube Video of how it was built. It will mean even more to you when you get there.

So we arrived early (I was excited) and our room wasn’t ready so they offered us an upgrade to a Club Suite. I figured, in for a pound, so we took it. And oh, was it worth it. We cancelled our tour plans and enjoyed the suite and the hotel for 2 days. The suite was 300 square meters and the living area, well one friend looked at our pictures and thought it was the lobby of the hotel. I just kept wandering around the suite not quite believing we were really there. It took several hours just to photograph the suite. 

The suite and the hotel have so many points of interest that I had to make separate video just for the hotel, separate from my Dubai video. Downstairs, was the living room/family room/bar areas. All just incredibly lush and covered with gold. Then there was a dining area, a snooker room and a full kitchen. 

Upstairs was as setting room area, office area and the bedroom, changing room and bath. All with more gold plating than we’d ever seen.

And the views. We had 2 story high windows to look out at the city and Palm Island. We were on the 19th floor, but I was able to even video fish schooling in the water below. We sat and watched the views for hours. The hotel itself takes a day to tour. The indoor very gold pool on the 18th floor (see my video) was so lush, I was almost afraid to swim. The restaurants were excellent and had awesome views, just like our room. And the lobby had fish tanks beside the escalators and dancing water fountains and pillars that rose as far as you could see. It’s an architectural triumph and we got to stay there. 

Finally the people were awesome. They made us feel right at home. You’d think it would be over the top, but the butlers and staff made sure we had everything just the way we wanted it without overdoing 
It. Wonderful people. A wonderful experience. And if we could afford it, we’d do it again tomorrow. We are retired and have traveled extensively. But we’ve never had an experience like we had at the Burj Al Arab.","5","2016-05"
"luxury at the utmost","We stayed in the Burj in 2008 (and I have only just thought about writing a review, so things might have changed since then but i'll keep it simple). A wonderful hotel and staff, luxury that we are not used to but certainly loved the pampering, especially as it was our honeymoon. We stayed in the Deluxe suite, which was practically a house by French living space standards. A lovely grape drink and cake with roses awaited us, a lovely surprise, it was a shame I had to leave the roses there. Everything was spick and span. We had our own butler (I can't remember his name but he was very kind and always on hand). We dined at the Al Iwan restaurant, food and service were second to none (as expected). Access to the Wadi water park was included for guests, which was excellent we had so much fun. oh the memories. If I could spend that much again I would go again, I would definitely recommend it to others though","5","2015-08"
"Utterly amazing! Spoils you for life!","From the moment you drive up to the moment you leave, this place will captivate you. It is pure opulence, and the service is out of this world. If you are looking to be treated like royalty and to be surrounded by wealth and absolute luxury then this place is the place to go.
We stayed for 2 nights as a special treat with our young son and we loved every second of it. The small personal touches, everyone addressing you by your name, the butler running you a bath of your choice, unpacking your case, repacking your case, nothing was too much trouble. The amazing selection of Hermes toiletries and Burj al Arab gifts, luxury chocolates etc. The list is endless. 
Ignore any negative reviews and just book it, you will not be disappointed.","5","2015-07"
"Simply stunning ","This hotel is so beautiful and Magnificent I don't actually want to say too much and give anything away. It is a true luxury, if you want an all out amazing holiday to save up for, come and stay here. 

The decor is beautiful with most things made of carved gold, the service is extraordinary and the facilities.... I'm not telling!! But out of this world.

If you want to do Dubai in absolute style and class. Stay here! ","5","2015-09"
"Huge suites, opulence and amazing service all around","Had not originally planned on staying here but extended our stay in Dubai with 2 nights to experience Burj Al Arab. We were not disappointed. From the Rolls Royce pickup from our other hotel, the welcome and check-in experience at the hotel to the butler desks on every floor. You have to go here to experience it, it's not just a hotel stay. Almost every time we got up to our floor, a butler met us at the elevator, walked us to our suite (not a long walk) and opened the door. Why we have a door key, I don't know. Btw, the door key is the most generic thing you will see there - it's just a white card, but it does come in a Burj Al Arab leather wallet!. You go to the beach and they immedialty bring out a personal cooler with water and cold towels in it. You can order caviar and the finest food, right on the beach. Too much? Of course, that's what Burj Al Arab is all about and I feel they really live up to it. We splurged and did a private helicopter tour from the Burj Al Arab helipad and the experience of taking off and then landing at the hotel is incredible. Pricey, but so is the hotel. Needless to say, after the original two night extension we extended for another two nights, trying out a Panorama suite with windows stretching two stories.","5","2016-04"
"Afternoon Tea","Spent a wonderful afternoon here having Afternoon high tea for my birthday. Loved being spoiled by the staff, and the food was excellent. The view from the restaurant at the top of the building (the rectangular bit added on the side) looks over the ocean and has spectacular views. The inside of the sail structure is fascinating, and the interior throughout a highly maintained standard","4","2015-09"
"Not just a meal but an experience","My gorgeous partner booked this afternoon tea (as well as the trip to Dubai!!) as a suprise for my 40th Birthday and what a way to celebrate. 

Now first off to call this 'afternoon tea' does not do this justice. It was a delicious 7 course meal which tickled & delighted all our senses with dishes created to reflect a journey from Japan to China to Korea to Indonesia. As each dish was brought out the origin & ingredients were explained by Vikram (I'll got on to this guy at the end) then we were left to enjoy.

My partner gave advance notice that she has a mushroom allergy & rather than simply receiving two dishes with the mushroom taken out she received two bespoke courses.

The building, architecture & decor and feel of this hotel is beautiful with every inch worth savouring.

Then there is the staff, everyone of which welcomed/spoke warmly to us & made us feel valued & important. My partner had apparently mentioned in the booking email that it was my Birthday celebration. I was wished Happy Birthday upon arrival & then to top it off we (yes 'we' as my partner had no idea either) were surprised with a Birthday cake & Vikram & three other waiters giving a rendition of Happy Birthday!

Last but not least there's Vikram. I have never been taken such good care of or received such excellent service. His attention to detail, knowledge of Dubai, recommendations & pride in work were second to none. Following this day I checked out the Burj Al Arab's Facebook page & unsurprisingly Vikram was receiving compliments left, right & center! Vikram you're a legend & thanks for making this an incredible Birthday & experience :)","5","2016-06"
"Such Opulence","We had afternoon tea here in May.  There is no way in the world we could afford to stay here but we did want to see it, so we compromised with afternoon tea.  Still expensive but we did it as a one off treat.  Such opulent surroundings and oozes class and money!","4","2016-05"
"Burj Al Arab Culinary Flight - Once in a lifetime experience...","I took my father and my wife to the 5 course Culinary Flight at the Burj Al Arab. Ever since moving to Dubai, I wanted to check out this iconic structure, but the $1200+ US price tag always kept me from booking a night. The Culinary Flight turned out to be a great way to get to see many different parts of the hotel and enjoy some of the best meals I've had in my life! The hospitality was amazing, the views were stupendous, the experience was just overall out of this world!

The experience starts at the Skyview bar where you enjoy a drink while making your selections for the 5 courses. Each meal is served at a different restaurant with a different speciality, so you have lots of options. Also, you will be STUFFED by the time you finish. Each meal was amazing in its own right - I won't go into great detail, just know the food is top notch. The whole process takes over 5 hours - it is a nice and relaxing evening, you never feel rushed. Although it is pricey, if you can afford it I would strongly recommend it for a special occasion or celebratory event.","5","2016-04"
"Luxury Starts from Here","When you talk about Burj Al Arab, you are out of words what to write about it. Its the Ultimate Luxury Hotel in the world. Unbelievable Architect, Best views of Dubai & above all, its favorite destination for the Bollywood & Hollywood stars as well.","4","2015-07"
"Fun with Ultimate Luxury","If you are really looking for some real pleasure to your eyes - This is the place to be. Everything over here is to the T. The breathtaking view of the sea, efficient staff, tasty food and brilliant experience in the city is a complete package to a memorable stay. Yes.. prices are more than normal. But worth it as you can be amazed by the hospitality.","5","2016-05"
"emirates","The hotel is something from a fairy tale, everything you can dream of is in that hotel, the service, the food, the ambience and the rooms, to die for. The Views from the hotel terrace was spectacular, the service from the employees, you couldn't ask for anything better ...","5","2016-05"
"What do you expect? ","What I love about this place? There's too much to mention! The design and interior of the hotel and room were stunning! I couldn't describe by words, I guess you guys can Google and look for it. 

Check in/check out 
Was greeted by the staff once we stepped out from the taxi, we didn't even have to carry our own luggages, just tell the staff your name and they will do the rest for you. A warm hand towel and Arabic dates handed to us, and a staff came and showed us around and escorted us to our room. We done our check in inside our own suite, which means you don't have to wait at the lobby reception to do your check in all that. Check out was just the same like check in. Fast, convenient and easy.  

Room
The best thing about the room, I think is fragrance. I don't know where it came from but seriously, the whole room, or I should say, the whole hotel smells so good! I think this tiny stuff made a big plus to this hotel.(in my opinion). Number of phones in the room, TV screen with my name on it, gold ipad, Hermes amenities, jacuzzi in our bathroom, free flow of drinking water, 24 hours private butler. What else? Go to explore yourselves and tell us. I won't talk about cleanliness all that because.. Come one. Its five stars hotel with a nickname 7-stars.

Services and facilities 
Free entrance to Wild Wadi Waterpark, lot of buggy which fetch you around the Jumeirah area, to private beach or madinat jumeirah or wild wadi, was too too convenient! The private beach was so clean, quiet and calm. In suite breakfast, what could I say about this? Superb! Made our order night before, woke up with full and decorated fine food on our dining table in our room. So many choice of foods, full course, and I bet you can't able to finish it, I swear. The portion was small, but varieties of food! The interior design of the indoor swimming pool is nice as well, too bad we din really spend our time there. Definitely will spend my whole day there if I visit this hotel again in the future. The butler we got was nice, but somehow I feel he was too busy smtg else, but I'm not sure. The head of butler was another different story. She was just the way too nice, stood up and greeted us everytime we passed by the main desk out side the lift area, and she even helped us open our room door and so on. Beside that, we got a small surprise from the hotel after our dinner at madinat jumeirah, what kind of surprise? Book it and Find out yourselves. :D

Dining
Plenty of restaurants in the hotel, and madinat jumeirah. I'm not sure about the restaurants in the hotel, but I recommend a bar which called GOLD on 27. If you drink,  don't forget to pay there a visit, you will get one of the best cocktail you have ever try. Trust me. The restaurants around madinat were nice as well. 

The staff will try their best to fulfil your requirements and all that. What negative comments I could say about this place is.. I can't find one. Just book it, definitely recommend this place if you travel to Dubai! ","5","2016-05"
"Very disappointing afternoon tea","The Burn itself is an amazing looking hotel and this was my birthday big treat. Big 50 so something to celebrate and we were visiting a very good friend of mine who I having seen in a old time, so double special occasion. 
I can't fault the staff they couldn't have been more lovely and if it hadn't been for them I would have made a real complain. 
We were so disappointed with the food quality and imagination of products. I have had an great deal better for a fraction of the cost. When you pay a large amount about £130.00 each you expect so much more. What made it memorable but for the wrong reason we were all poorly within two hours of leaving which ment we couldn't go onto the Burg Khalifa which we had booked. 
It was such a shame","2","2016-06"
"Unique architecture","The Burj Al Arab happens to be one of the most well-recognized landmarks of middle east and rightly so. The sail-boat shape and juxtaposition to the white sands of Jumeirah beach are a sight to behold. From what the local guides informed staying there would definitely be an experience in luxury but even from outside the hotel looks grand and is worth a visit along with the beach.","4","2016-06"
"Quaint hotel Finally renovated!","Signature of the town. Definitely place to be and experience luxury Arabian culture, hospitality and unusual design by stepping to the hotel . As per my opinion I would say its more about an experience and never ending excitements and energy you receiving during the stay or at your first time visit. However in my opinion its not a place to stay second time. Especially if you are with family. Its not a family friendly hotel. If you have kids rather stay in neighbor Jumeirah Beach hotel with fully equipped kids pool, kids club , ect. Burj al arab is more for singles or couple travelers. Though the room size will be shocking. Room starts from  1,830 square feet . Vintage furniture , like you going back to Kings time , the hotel rooms wasn’t renovated since opening ( more than 15 years) but  its still looks new and tidy. If you western the colors will shocked you too. Mismatching blue , yellow , red and leopard , revolving beds surrounded by mirrors gives strange feeling of the ambience.. Personally I didn’t feel comfortable, but for kind of bachelor party I would definitely consider such an enormous and “colorful” room. Floor to ceiling windows. Blue horizon from any part of the room makes you tipsy from the ambience around. Room’s Bathroom itself and amenities are the top luxury I ve seen.   Classy and spacious with walk-in wardrobes.  Even in the lobby is always a crowd up in the suite is always calm , peaceful and private. 
If you are travelling in an incognito status be assured that security wise BAA has no equal.  For each room attached personalized private butler and information about your stay does not spread to anyone else. Any request will be taken on a prompt action. Cannot imagine anyone not enjoying their time here as you are free minded from everything. Service indeed faultless; the genuine sincerity of ALL staff including cleaners is second to none. NO other hotel could ever reach the heights of The Burj Al Arab service the 1 st class never the less. 

Moving to the spa. I have to say that its requires  renovation and upgrade for Gym equipment
New beach extension outside is something WOW. Pool , sand beach and sea water in an infinity pool sliding to the ocean ..such a an unique and posh place. Plus they offer private room on the beach ;) a bit costly though. 

Restaurants are renewed in design and concepts:
Gold on 27th doesn’t have minimum spend. Such a great spot to enjoy the sunset accompanying with the dj beat and amazing cocktails.  Such a glamorous place and unique gold interior.
Bab al Yam – love white color and this place is full white and bright inside and outside and splendid by the ocean views. 
Not sure in which restaurant they service brunch but I ve heard it’s the best spot in town nowadays and not that wealthy comparing with other hotels. Will definitely try it! 
Experience in Al Mahara restaurant was written in my separate review. 
Skyview Bar has such a romantic and lovable atmosphere. By the way musicians in the hotel are such a talented people .  In Skyview bar they make the ambience more warm and same is in the lobby. My regards to the musicians! Skyview bar offers a  moving station for preparation of  your own hand made drink. )) We had fun )). 
In overall Burj al Arab is a memorable experience and place to visit at least once. But don’t forget to make the reservation in the restaurant before stepping into hotel if you are not staying there.","5","2016-05"
"Evening Cocktails","My Sister and I came here for cocktails (Sky View Bar), we where warmly welcomed as soon as we stepped out of our car and was directed to the lifts, there was even an attendant by the lifts which pressed the button for us to the correct floor, arriving at the sky view bar we where asked to take a seat for a moment until our table was set, we arrived at 9.30pm it was busy but we where still seated with a window view, the view was just amazing I had a Burj Royale cocktail and a Blue Orchid cocktail which actually came with a blue orchid in it, we where also given some appetisers and I mentioned it was my birthday prior to arriving, and they brought me out a cake and a rose, which I thought made the evening that even more special.. All in all a lovely evening and I would recommend. The cocktails where a little pricy but you are paying for an experience and its well worth it in my eyes.. One to visit.","5","2016-06"
"Must of visit hotel in the world.","Pros:

    I had Lunch in Al Marhaba restaurant Palm tree view and ocean from restaurant that''s out of expectation that show's you wonders while having lunch in such a great hotel. Moreover, It's costliest hotel all over the world no need to think it as optional for dubai.
Spending money for just lunch or dinner is worth full and royal feel in you. Must to go in Luxury car for feel better. It's wonderful hotel. Lift view of the hotel take you near ocean.

Cons:

  I never had such a worst taste of food in my life as indian tadka foodie. But, view's must see once in every lucky person's life.
  Entrance of the Burj Al Arab and it's sofa is outdated version need to upgrade there reception is loss of business and egoistic approach receptionist they never want to entertain indian's or any desi lolz.
Reception staff have no manners for middle class viewers when i enquired about hotel room to stay. That employee should shameful. She is lack of knowledge of human values. where she is working fact is outdated look of reception shame on her and rest of the hotel is fantastic to see. First floor shops are still 2000's generation need to upgrade to new look in royalty many things to observe by management of this hotel. They are tired with inside interior architecture. It's overall not even new doors of hotel inside. first floor door was not closing properly. In such a royal hotel doors are not closed well. Is't it shameful to this management. Who are always proud to work inside but innocent management never thought of improvements look wise. Waiters of al marhaba black waiter was keep watching my girl friend i never had such worst experience even in small hotels of thailand.","4","2015-12"
"Worth Every Dirham","Worth Every Single Dirham	

Ten years ago I passed through Dubai on my way to Afghanistan and met a young family that stayed one night in the Burj Al Arab. Of course, when told the cost for a night (about a mortgage payment), I thought to myself, who in their right mind would ever would pay that much for a hotel stay?  Seems like ten years can change one’s mind, because now I fully understand why. We booked a one-night stay under the UAE residence rate, which included breakfast; discount vouchers for the spa (we didn’t use); access to Wild Wadi (we’ll go another time); in-room cocktails and canapés; and full-size Hermès toiletries for him and for her. This was in celebration of our wedding anniversary.

Check in was not until 3:00 PM, so we decided to grab lunch at the nearby Mina A’ Salam hotel in the Souk Madinat Jumeirah. At 1:10 PM I called to see if our room was available and was told to come to the hotel and use the facilities if not. We made our way to the hotel, note that access to the property is only if you have restaurant or hotel reservations, and were greeted at the door by a bellman and our greeter who escorted us to our room. On the way up, she explained that check in was taken care of in the room (!). Our room was 1103 and faced the north end of Dubai toward the Burj Khalifa. As the rooms are duplex floors, it really meant the 22nd floor. We were greeted by the butlers at the concierge desk on our floor and shown to our room. It made an impression with the door open and the view to the sweeping staircase leading up to the bedroom. Soon after we entered our welcome drink arrived, our greeter left and our butler Cyra arrived, who proceeded to complete our check in process. She gave us a tour of the room, asked if we wanted her to unpack our things, (nope) and left us to continue our stay. By this time, it was roughly 2:20PM and we opted to make our way to the new terrace pool extension. What a delight. Two pools, one fresh water, one salt water. We made a beeline for the salt-water infinity pool at the end of the extension. It’s surrounded by the private cabanas and in the front are chaise lounge chairs and round sun beds in a sandy ‘beach’. A beach assistant found us a bed, lined it with towels, and promptly brought over a cooler with water, cold towels, and face spray. It was replenished throughout our visit.
We stayed at the pool all afternoon until about 6:00 PM with a stop at the swim up pool bar around 4ish. Our bartender Mahmoud Harris was a star. He convinced me to try a Green Monk (!!) and made great conversation; this, despite the fact that he was fasting for Ramadan, had the best attitude. We also met Paul, an equally charming staff member from Sri Lanka. We left the pool with grand plans to catch the sunset at the Sky View bar, which we were told required reservations and, blah, blah, blah. Not in the mood to make a huge effort, we decided we’ve seen plenty of sunsets and would enjoy the room instead. Our evening butler (didn’t catch his name) soon arrived with cocktails and canapés. He even returned for a second round. There was a nice box of baklava in a Burj Al Arab signature shaped box (delish). We considered our dining options and took a look at the Private Dining menu and decided to order in. I ordered the organic greens and gnocchi with Arrabiata sauce while my husband ordered the lobster Caesar salad. Sadly, what arrived was a lobster salad with mango (his one allergy). Not sure if the communication failure was on our end or their end, but no matter, the intended salad arrived after a quick phone call and we were stuffed! The bill was a very reasonable 420 Aed. Granted, we didn’t have any alcohol, but by Dubai standards, that was an inexpensive meal. As a comparison, lunch at Tortugas (a Mexican restaurant) was 270 Aed. We had asked the butler, Kelly, to prepare our Jacuzzi bath at 8:30 and decided to move it up to 8:00 PM – we were wiped out from a day in the saltwater pool. Soon after, we checked out the Hermes toiletries.

We turned in early and found turn down service with bespoke Patchi chocolates in the shape of the hotel and a single red rose on either side of the bed. We were fast asleep in the comfiest of beds by 9:00 (complete with over head mirror). Note you are able to select your optimal pillow from the Pillow Menu! One might find an over the bed mirror cheap a la Vegas or the Poconos, but it was actually a bit fun.  At 9:30 our evening butler called to say they had an anniversary surprise for us. With my slumbering spouse at my side, I declined until the morning. 

Breakfast was in Bab Al Yam located poolside by the original hotel pool, which is shockingly small. We started breakfast outside and moved inside as the temperature became warmer. The buffet had many selections and my husband said his omelet was the best he’s ever had. The coffee was perfection and the service was attentive and prompt.  We made our way back to the room and were surprised by the Head Butler Anila and Cyra with a beautifully displayed chocolate cake, a card signed by the hotel general manager, and a bouquet of red roses in celebration of our wedding anniversary. Such a gorgeous display (we even got to take the flowers home) and the chocolate cake too, which was divine.

As we were granted a late checkout time, we opted to spend the rest of the morning into the afternoon in the same saltwater pool. Same fabulous pool side attention, gorgeous weather, and a fabulous breeze. We remarked several times how relaxing it was and how it felt like a three-day vacation, when it hadn’t even been 24 hours yet! At 1:30 we made our way back to the room and said our goodbyes to the pool staff. Cyra and Karan were there to pack up a bottle of champagne we didn’t drink, the bouquet of roses, and the cake. Check out was taken care of at the butler’s desk on the floor and we made our way down to the lobby escorted by Cyra.  We didn’t make it to the spa or to the pool on the 18th floor.  We’ve visited the Sky View Bar and Al Muntaha on other visits so we didn’t make it this time. Al Mahara was under renovation and we hope to visit soon. The terrace pool is one of the most divine pools I’ve experienced.

Verdict: If it’s in your budget and you can afford it, stay here. The Burj Al Arab has a wow factor however dated some of the décor might feel (it opened in 1999). The staff and the awe-inspiring interior are what set this property apart from others. Certainly, there are numerous options to be found in Dubai, but to have the privilege of being a guest in this hotel is not to be missed. We approached our stay with an attitude that it has to be done once in a lifetime, at least. We left with the conviction that for as long as we live in Dubai, this will be an annual event. A massive thank you to the staff who made our stay extra special, our greeter (Susanne, I think), our butlers, Cyra, Kelly and Karan (and one other whose name I missed), to Paul and Mahmoud Harris at the pool and to the Turkish man at Bab Al Yam with the American accent – sincerely, thank you. We look forward to seeing you again very, very soon.","5","2016-06"
"Once in a Lifetime Hotel","From the drive up the meandering bridge, to the flawless greeting staff and the beautiful lobby with fish tanks and fountains, this hotel is something special from the moment you get past the security gate. The finishes are spotless, the lobby and restaurants are destinations by themselves, and the spa is amazing, with windows in the sauna, steam room, and treatment rooms overlooking the Gulf. It is a pricey place, but in my opinion worth every penny for one visit.","5","2016-03"
"Absolutely amazing out of this world a memorable experience ","We booked for afternoon tea for my partners 40th the restaurant we originally booked was closed due to Ramadan therefore we were booked into the Junsai restaurant for eastern afternoon tea, and I'm so glad we were!!!! From the minute we arrived in this beautiful building it was out of this world, the afternoon tea is an experience where by your senses are taken through a Journey from Japan, China, Korea to Indonesia. Each dish explained and savoured, your encouraged to take your times to fully enjoy every minute. The food melted in your mouth and was absolutely the best I've ever ever tasted, I had an allergy so I was made two dishes completely for me! Not on the menu! , we were served by Vikram who is absolutely a shining example of the best customer service I think I will ever encounter. His attention to us was out of this world, his knowledge of Dubai was fantastic and his recommendations were perfect, I've never known anyone so passionate about their job and a country, he really is a shinning example of what the Burj Arab had to offer. Whilst the restaurant is of the highest quality it has a relaxed feel which isn't pretentious and you are not treated any differently despite whether your a staying hotel member or just visiting for afternoon tea. We were there for over 3 hours and no rush to leave which is fantastic and again demonstrates the experience that they are offering each customer, the decor was amazing and it was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. And to top it off a birthday cake with candles and a happy birthday for my partner, next time we will be back for dinner! I cannot recommend this enough and the food was a taste bud sensation. Vikram again is an amazing host and he made the experience even more fantastic. The price for the food is amazing we went for the drinks package and again we weren't disappointed, I could go on! This trip was one we will treasure thank you. ","5","2016-06"
"THIS IS DUBAI.","I wrote a long and beautiful review , but while proof reading i accidentally deleted it. So im gonna make a different one:

It is a luxury hotel that represents Dubai, they built a long floating deck with 2 pools and a beach.
they have lots of butlers.
This place will eat your wallet like fire ants. 
The architecture and decoration still impresses me. 
The restaurants are out dated. and not so fancy as it should be. But one of them are going trough renovations. 
The gym is ugly. 
The spa is beautiful, but a little dirty, they need to remove some scratches from the pillars, not okay for a 7*!
The food is satisfactory. The afternoon tea is also very nice.
they need to put more effort into welcoming their guess like they did in 2001. 
Well, at least they try to full fill every need of every guest. which is good.","5","2015-12"
"Good stay but not perfect ","Burj Al arab is from the top hotels in Dubai , the staff is the best thing in the hotel , the service was perfect , but i gave the hotel 4/5 in my opinion of the rooms , i think the rooms should be renewed, the towels in the bath room are old really old, the furniture is not my type at all but overall it was a good stay , many thanks to the staff ","4","2016-04"
"Luxury from a distance.","Truly a sight to behold from a distance. The architecture is impressive. Makes you wonder how it is on the inside. Sunset and night view are the best when you're at the beach nearby. Didn't have the opportunity to check in as a guest but nevertheless impressed with the beauty I saw. Quite a bit far from the Marina when you're taking the cab, more than 30 minutes. Traffic could add up to the travel time.","5","2016-04"
"Stunning but some room for improvement","The duplex panoramic suite on the 7th floor was huge and of the highest quality. Great views of Dubai city.  The butler service per floor is also fantastic - they really do go out of there way to make you feel comfortable. They seemed to service the room every time we popped out...

The new terrace is quite breathtaking, great views of the palm island and a stunning infinity pool.

They operate a free buggy service that takes you to the nearby beach, water park and souk; all of which are well worth a visit.

Where could improvements be made?  We were half board and though the food was good, I think there is room for an increased variety. 

The staff are so very helpful but not always most knowledgable or fluent in English (I'm nitpicking a little).

Is it worth the money?  

I stayed at the (5 star) zabeer Saray at the Palm prior to the burj hotel. The food and service at zabeer was excellent and the balcony room was also to a very good standard. The spa at this hotel is renowned and prob the best in the world. I'm not a spa person but this place has to be seen to be believed. It's amazing.

But the burj was a step up in quality of hotel, room, location and general facilities.

One thing that is very noticeable is that at the Palm hotels the beaches are inside the Palm - where there is no tide !!!

So It's very much like a lake...so no respite from the heat, and no breeze.

I will never stay at the Palm again for this reason.

The day we moved to the burj, the drop in temperature was very noticeable, as was the increased breeze.

The burj al Arab is priced of course but the experience is worth every penny and as a once a year or once a lifetime experience I would highly recommend.

"Spectacular achitecture surpases your wildest Arabian fantasies...","From the minute you walk into the atrium of this hotel you feel like you are in an uber-jazzed-up fantasy beyond your wildest imaginings of the Arabian Nights...The dates provided by the welcoming hostess added a nice touch of exotic flavor as we rode up the glass elevators to our floor. Our two-story suite was tastefully appointed with Hermes soaps in the bathrooms. The office in the first floor of the suite provided a spectacular view of the Persian Gulf and the nearby Jumeirah hotel below from the other window. Internet censoring made it impossible for look up information on breast cancer, and we did find the personal concierge team out our door which interrupted the tv with a live video feed of someone at the door a bit intrusive but the attention and care given to every other detail made for a rather pleasant experience. One bonus we did not anticipate was the beauty of the hotel at night when we returned from a night in the desert -- it was beautifully lit up in changing colors that stood magically against the backdrop of the waters that lead to the Strait of Hormuz.","5","2015-07"
"High tea in Skyview bar","Everything about this place is opulent.
From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave you feel the place. Just getting to the Skyview bar is amazing the glass elevator beautiful.
The staff so attentive and the attention to detail. Beautiful champagne on arrival....fantastic food with multiple courses including palate cleanses and traditional finger sandwiches and pastries. Though little about this is traditional.
Our waiter Scott was lovely, really friendly and helpful and at tgd end we were allowed to relax by the windows andno stress about pushing us out.
Totally recommend this special experience but it is expensive.","5","2016-06"
"Truly ""the worlds most LUXURIOUS hotel""","Truly a pinch yourself experience from arrival to departure. Forget all the hype we read about A list and Hollywood tales. This hotel is truly a cut above and not one to be missed. From the first class arrival to the VIP check in, this hotel could not provide more pinch myself moments. Truly a remarkable experience. Having visited the hotel on several occasions, this did not have any reflection of the our experience as a hotel guest. The experience was out of this world while remarkable at the same time. A totally unique hotel in a totally unique city. Nothing comes close with regards to ""WOW"" factor and welcome.","5","2016-05"
"Expensive ","The costliest hotel on a man-made island. Very luxurious and great interior-exterior. Love this place !!! This place totally out of budget and extremely expensive . Burj Al Arab has also got wonderful location. Lovely food and dining with great staff.","5","2015-11"
"Out of this world experience","My husband and I have just returned from a four night stay at the Burj Al Arab.  We had visited the hotel on previous trips to Dubai, for lunch and afternoon tea and had been impressed, but I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing experience of staying at this wonderful hotel.  From beginning to end we were absolutely blown away.  The hotel's decor is certainly distinctive and bold, but it absolutely works in that setting.  Everything is immaculate and exciting, the hotel has a vibrant buzz and the staff are absolutely wonderful; nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel so incredibly welcome.  We very much enjoy staying at beautiful, world class hotels, and do so on a fairly regular basis, but the Burj Al Arab is like being transported to another world.  We absolutely cannot wait to return.","5","2016-05"
"Iconic but dated hotel, best bit the exterior, worst bit a salt water swimming pool!","Stayed for 3 nights and it looks a picture on the outside. However most of the hotel is dated on the interior. Some fade on carpets, room had some technical equipment issues, restaurants were ok, gym equipment was old. Definitely not first choice.

Pro's were excellent wifi, views from everywhere and lots of gold","2","2016-05"
"Consistently Exceptional","Opulent yes, decadent yes expensive yes but without doubt a memorable experience. We stayed in a beautiful deluxe suite on the 21st floor and the views of the Palm and Jumeirah beach were stunning. The butler team were fantastic and provided a number of surprises as we celebrated our anniversary. 

Many thanks to Sylvia and the team in the Sky Bar, a must, and the Burj team have done a great job with the Terrace which was very much needed due to the limited pool facilities previously

We will return and again thanks to the team for the memories","5","2016-06"
"Champagne Afternoon Tea","We booked this direct with the hotel as part of our honeymoon and were made to feel very welcome as soon as we entered the hotel. Our server, Marky was very attentive, informative and made our experience truly memorable. For drinks we had champagne and tea although other beverages are available. Don't have anything to eat before you go because you will be suitably satisfied upon leaving.  The many courses were exquisite with the ""sandwiches"" course being offered further tastings. Our personal favourite was smoked salmon and crab as well as the carrot cake in the sweet course. We had informed them it was our honeymoon and so was presented with a beautiful red rose.  Marky gave the right level of attentiveness but not intrusive and we did not feel rushed at all.  Was one of the highlights of our trip and we will be back.Fantastic view, great touches like the serving stands in the shame of the hotel just took it to another level.","5","2016-05"
"Magnificent Experience!","No better place in the world than the Burj Al Arab! They have the most wonderful staff and I have stayed at grand places all over the world (Milan, Germany, Abu Dhabi, Bali, etc). The opulence of this place is fit for a king or queen. I was upgraded free of charge to the Panoramic Club Suite... One word: WOW! Luxurious throughout and amazingly spectacular views.  Their signature restaurant, Al Mahara, featuring the wall to wall, ceiling to ceiling aquarium room for the best, most romantic ambiance imaginable. And the food was to die for!  The staff… they are ALL the best, most professional, most knowledgeable, friendliest of staffs anywhere in the world. And what stood out to me most about their staff is that they all appear to genuinely love their jobs. I even asked a few… and they confirmed that the Burj was the best place they had ever worked. The airport pickup/drop off by Rolls Royce Phantom was the fairytale beginning and ending to the most splendid weekend getaway I’ve ever experienced.  They definitely live up to their 7 star rating… but after this trip I think they are deserving of a 10 star rating. I will return…","5","2016-05"
"Great holiday","top lux class. 2 floors suite 180 m2 with your own butler.
Spa was fantastic and in a huge area to relax after caviar treatment.
Restaurants are superb, especially the fish restaurant built in an aquarium
The breakfast restaurant is outdoors, and a beach car take you from there to the privat beach where you have enormous privat space, excellent.
The rolls royce hotel car to the AirPort was great. Service was super all over, but all waiters Asked us to write ratings n the restaurants, which was too much.
Fantastic hotel and facilities , recommended highly.","5","2015-10"
"Burj Al Arab Jumeirah is Amazing!","This is an amazing place to stay. From the entrance,to the reception area with the aquariums on either side to the fountains in the second floor.The stay in Burj Al Arab is exceptional! The view, the Butler service, the amenities when you stay here are worth the price. It is very expensive, but if it is a bucket list dream come true this is it.","5","2016-05"
"EXTREMELY poor value for money.","I recently visited the Burj Al Arab in May for Afternoon Tea. 
We had already been to the Burj Khalifa in December for Afternoon Tea (which was phenomenal) so we had out exceptions set already from our experience there. 

We paid £260 for Afternoon Tea at the Burj Al Arab (£20/£30 less than Burj Khalifa), the money isn't an issue when you have a certain expectation. 

The place itself is incredible and attention to detail through the building is amazing. However, when it came to the Afternoon Tea I was so disappointed. 
We had the same amount of food for 2 people as the 1 Gentleman sat next to us had. We had 4 tiny sandwiches,1 scone and 2 cakes.
This experience was so disappointing and upsetting and I do truly feel I have wasted nearly £300 on something I wouldn't recommend to anyone.","1","2016-05"
"World's Tallest Hotel","Burj Al Arab Jumereirah is the worlds' tallest hotel, standing at 321m high and located on its own artificial island on the Dubai coastline.  At night, the exterior of the Burj Al Arab is beautiful sight to behold as the choreographed colored lighting show changes every 30 minutes. One of the restaurants in the Burj Al arab (Al Muntaha meaning ""highest"") is located 200m above the Persian gulf and is accessed by a panoramic elevator.  Another restaurant (Al Mahara meaning the ""The oyster"") is accessed via a simulated submarine voyage and features a large seawater acquarium. It is one of the expensive hotels in the world to stay in.
If you are not staying, you need a restaurant reservation to get past lobby security. Prices of rooms vary from approximately $1000 to $27000 per night.","5","2015-10"
"World Class Service!  A truly high end experience.","My family of a 5 year old, 14 month old, and wife stayed at the Burj for one night after a 16 night cruise, and I must say, this was definitely the highlight of our vacation.
There truly are no words to describe how beautiful the hotel is.  It architecturally gorgeous and our 1 bedroom 2 level suite was absolutely amazing.  Everything looks as though it is brand new, and the attention to detail and maintenance was top notch.  There are no ""Out of service"" signs that I could find.  The suite was tastefully decorated, and while lavish, not so over the top that it would be a turn off.
Truly where the Burj Excelled in my opinion, was the service.  From the moment you arrive, there fleet of staff, will pretty much pamper you in every way possible.  I feel it is getting harder and harder to find top end service, but you will not have that problem at the Burj Al Arab.  Each suite has a butler assigned to it, and the word ""No"" or ""I don't know"" must literally get drilled out of them.  Any time you ask a question that they don't have the answer to, they will immediately call to find out, look it up, or find someone who can answer it.  One time I simply asked ""Is the Dubai Mall on the way to the airport?"", next thing I know, I have a printed map from google, highlighting where the mall was and the airport, and the route to get there.  Any time you have a question, if it is possible to show you the answer, such as where something is, they will walk you there, instead of just telling you.  (This is time permitting, if there was a line of people waiting to ask a question, then they might just give directions, but if there was no one around, they would simply walk you there.)
The staff even took the time to play and show my 5 year old around the lobby and aquariums.  This was at a time when there was literally a Ferrari convention with 100 Ferrari owners showing up, at 7PM on a friday night.  This is the busiest time of the week for the Burj, and they took literally 20 minutes of their time to give my son a couple toys, play with him, and show him around the hotel while we were waiting to go to the airport.

The staff was incredibly kind to my 5 year old and 14 month old, never having me feel like that they were a burden to the staff.  While a super high end place, I never felt like children were not welcome.

The terrace was finished the day before we got there, and it is GORGEOUS.  Something literally out of a movie.

Do yourself a favor and stay there at least once in your life.  Is the Burj the best value for your dollar, not likely, but you definitely get what you paid for.","5","2016-05"
"Amazing Experience","Had a time of my life at this hotel staff was excellent.

I was so surprised on how the receptionist knew my name the moment I entered they said Welcome Mr. Amit Godhwani. It felt very good.

Food was excellent, wines were exclusive and amazing.","5","2015-06"
"Dreams Do Come True","We started visiting the Burj some 15 years ago and this year with the family at Jumeirah beach we booked a suite for 10 days. Last time we were in a panoramic,  but we weren't to be disappointed with our duplex suite. The space, the opulence, the layout, it's so difficult with out writing and writing to truly describe how wonderful this hotel really is. Every  time we stepped through our front door I kept wanting to picnch myself to check I wasn't dreaming. The dramatic colours of the furnishings, the decor it's as if everything was finished only yesterday. Nothing out of place. No request too much trouble for the butlers, who jump to your every need  and are all very very pleasant. It's easy to be totally indulged at the Burj, this hotel will always be our favourite and we hope to return again next year.

 Our view this time was across The  Palm - WOW, how does one describe the view, the sun setting over The Palm, with the beach on your left, the Mina, Al Qasr all looking quite small down below, Atlantis in the distance, the Marina in the back drop, almost like New York with the high rises, the ocean, stretching out, 21 floors high, speed boats small on the sea, water clear green blue we could have sat and spent all day just looking out at this fabulous vision. 

We were slightly disappointed The Terrace wasn't ready as had been stated, so spent our days on the Club Exec beach at JBH with the kids. We have spent many years here too so we were happy enough but The Tearrce which was almost near completion looks as if it will be amazing, we look forward to really enjoying this next time.

Sky bar amazimg as always. the manageress Sylivia  is outstanding, her patter and attention are thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated and her staff are delightful and attentive. Loved Al Mahara. Eaten in all the restaurants but again with the family spent a number of evenings eating around the Madinat helping them experience as much as we could whilst with us for their week.

The  buzz in The Burj is just constant with so many visitors constantly taking pictures and admiring the fabulous waterfalls, fountains, flooring, furnishings however this is only on the ground and first floor. Once you are on the floor of your suite all is calm and peaceful and it feels special to be staying in the hotel which is probably the most visited and pictured in the world.

The Spa again , lovely staff and fabulous to enjoy without being  overwhelming.

A special time for my husband and I and we absolutely loved every minute we were at the Burj. THank you to everyone who made our visit so wonderful.","5","2016-05"
"Our Recent stay in Burj","We like to come back every year, because we really feel like we are at home. Great people, spectacular hotel, amazing quality of service and unique atmosphere. It is a must visit hotel if you have chance. A place where there is no chance to hear ""Sorry, this is not possible"" or just ""No"".

"Perfect ","From the moment we arrived the attention to detail was perfect. Our chauffeur was really attentive and made sure our journey was comfortable and relaxed. When we arrived we were immediately shown to our room, which was quite something! Although the hotel is world famous it has a laid back calm feel about it. We enjoyed time around the pool and on the beach, where staff were always ready to serve drinks and food, the ice boxes were a nice touch. The complimentary buggies were great too, always available so no hanging around in the heat. There is nothing about this hotel I would change, it's so calm, friendly and relaxed, I cannot imagine anyone not enjoying their time here. Can't wait to return in January. ","5","2016-05"
"Eva Lilley","This is a very different hotel total luxury 
Pre book high tea if you can as its usually booked out. We enjoyed our evening meal next to a Huge aquarium .
This hotel also has a pillow menu
Our butler was excellent highly recommended.","5","2015-06"
"Superb Luxury Accommodation","This hotel is a fantastic, but really expensive, place to stay for a few nights.  All rooms are suites and the cheapest is around 1k per night (off peak) after taxes.  The suites are amazing, arranged over 2 floors they provide a perfect place for rest and relaxation.

The restaurants in the Burj al Arab are good without being exceptional, but the whole place is pure luxury and a stay here should be on everyone's bucket list.","5","2016-05"
"Eva Lilley","Excellent must try the spa with its scenic view .
Room was very spacious with an elegant stairwell leading to one of the bedrooms.. Lunch was served by our own attentive butler.

Also pre book Hi tea as it was booked 3 days advance.
Very exclusive","5","2015-06"
"Amazing Hotel","What can you say about this wonderful place. The suite was way over the top but in the best way. The bathroom is the most luxurious I have ever experienced. The most really notable thing is the service which was not in your face but 1st class never the less. The private beach is perfect as are the pools. Breakfast highly recommended.","5","2016-04"
"Disappointing stay - not even close to 7 star experience. Not worth the money!","My friend and I had been looking forward to our stay at Burj Al Arab as we love other Jumeirah Group hotels in Dubai and always had a wonderful experience. Unfortunately not this time. We arrived at the hotel and were offered a mint lemonade and dates but no gahwa. Every decent 5 star hotel in Dubai offers gahwa on arrival but not this one apparently. The check in process started with us waiting in the lobby for the reception lady who disappeared somewhere behind the golden cave to check our reservation and available rooms. Despite the fact that we told the hotel in advance about our expected arrival time they told us that our room with 2 twin beds was not ready and we would have to wait 2 hours for it. They offered a  room with a king bed instead or we were welcome to pay for an upgrade. We said we'd have a look at the suite with one bed but the check in lady kept repeating we can upgrade for a charge and we felt she just wanted our money. At other Jumeirah hotels if my room wasn't ready I would be offered a complimentary upgrade. And they had availability as they happily showed us the panoramic suite in the hope we would pay extra for it. There is no check in desk at the hotel so no immediate access to managers or someone who can actually make an upgrade decision. We didn't like the suite decor anyway and did not like how we were being pushed to upgrade for a charge so we decided to keep the standard suite. As we were 2 ladies staying in the suite we asked for a female butler and our request was granted, however the whole check in process was very impersonal and robotic, we did not feel special or even welcome. We had to repeat our request to remove the minibar several times before it was done. Same goes for providing 2 sets of bathroom amenities for ladies. I should also mention that there was no body lotion among the bathroom amenities. Maybe they are trying to save money by cutting corners and cheating on customer service. The staff was a letdown except for the lady who brought us a second set of shampoo and conditioner - there was only 1 set initially despite 2 guests staying! She was rewarded accordingly. 

Despite terrible customer service we loved some things about the suite - the view was lovely as we could see the city skyline and Jumeirah Beach hotel. The suite itself and furnishings looked dated though and there should have been more flowers around the suite (only orchids and floating roses in the living room). I was surprised to find that there was no usual control touch panel in the suite but instead one had to use the TV remote to control the room. 

We did not find the newspaper in the morning outside our suite (all decent 5 star hotels provide a complimentary daily newspaper). There as also no Vogue or other fashion magazine among the periodicals in the suite. For comparson, I had a copy of Vogue Arabia during my stay at Mina assalam.
In the morning it took us some time to find our breakfast restaurant as staff had not explained properly regarding bereakfast when they checked us in. We chose Bab al Yam and had a lovely breakfast sitting outside. Upon returning from breakfast we fully expected to have 2 more hours at the suite as we had asked for a late checkout, however we were informed that we had to vacate the suite immediately as it was already noon. They claimed that they were trying to give us a late checkout but were unable to. So we had to rush and run around the suite packing our belongings.

We should have asked to speak to the manager on checking out, however we were in a rush so we didn't. Overall, no attention to detail and poor customer service which is not acceptable at any 5 star hotel, let alone at a luxury hotel which calls itself a 7 star hotel. Nothing special about the hotel, there are far more superior and modern hotels in Dubai with excellent customer service. Disappointing!","2","2016-05"
"Another fantastic stay","We have just returned from another amazing stay at the hotel. Every time you drive up and see the hotel you can't help but get a feeling of excitement. As soon as the door of the car opens you are greeted warmly and by your name. We arrived early on this visit and even though check in is not till 3pm our room was ready. We were given and a refreshing drink and warm towel and taken straight up to our suite. The check in was seamless as ever with the butler coming in to the suite to do the formalities. The view from the suite was amazing as ever. You can never tire of it looking out towards the sea and the palm.We were soon changed and on our way to relax on the beach for the morning. In the afternoon we returned and relaxed near the pool. This was the same for most of our stay. The restaurants are as god as ever. The new pool are is not quite finished but looks very impressive. Hopefully it will be ready when we next visit. I would say you have to try it once if you can. We will be back soon.","5","2016-05"
"Surreal experience","We went for high tea at the Burj. It was a surreal experience. It's like stepping into the Arabian nights inside. I'm not a big fan of five star dining - but the Burj blew me away. The colors, the scents, the ambience. It was like stepping inside another world. We had arrived early and listened to a harpist before going in for the tea.

I don't think that I have ever tasted food so exquisite before. From the champagne to the cakes, the courses kept on getting better and better. The waiters were really nice - and had a chat with us. They even gave us some extra cakes at the end.

We loved it - the views and the staff made it a very special experience.","5","2015-08"
"afternoon tea sky view bar","went for afternoon tea this may 2016. it wasn't our first visit. However I have to say its getting a lot more expensive and not better quality. The price is more than 200 AED more than the last time and I don't think the food quality is as good as some other 5 star establishments in the world.  The view is fantastic from the sky view bar and of course the decor is OTT. Staff are excellent and very helpful.","4","2016-05"
"Afternoon Tea - at the Highest Level","Despit the heavy price tag - Afternoon Tea at the Burj Arab is a wonderful experience
(consider it  an excursion) and should you be celebrating a special occasion then this is the place to go.

Stunning stunning views - a 2 hour affair  sit back relax and listen to the harpist whilst enjoying a fine glass of Champagne  followed by the delights of afternoon tea.","5","2016-05"
"Amazing Stay, Fantastic service and Delicious Food","I had a splendid experience staying with my family in Burj Al Arab hotel for almost 3 days for my Birthday. With the highly maintained luxurious royal suite and stunning view from the suite in 14th floor, we experienced wonderful service, Delicious food at all the restaurants in entire hotel. All the employees were nice,caring and helpful. Amazing beach, swimming pool and Spa. Knowing I was vegetarian, Chef's there had taken so much care for me serving many varieties of Vegetarian food and off-course the delicious birthday cake (which was egg-less) they presented to me. Thanks to the team who surprised me with astonishing Birthday song played by Guitar Artist, wonderful roses and the lovely cake. Words are less to describe the experience. My advice to everybody would be to just experience Burj Al Arab stay for at least once in a lifetime after all it has its name saying Worlds most luxurious hotel","5","2016-05"
"First Class","Went for afternoon tea with my wife and son last Thursday, 19/05/16.   My son had made the reservation by email.    We just had to give the reservation number in at security and were then taken right up to the hotel.   It is truly amazing once inside.   Beautiful fish and a lovely fountain to keep you mesmerised.  We were taken up to the 27 th floor which is really 54 floors up.   From then on the attention to detail was first class.    We had the champagne seven course option.    All the food was delicious from the sandwiches to the cakes.    The view was amazing too.    We were allowed to take photographs before going down.    Wow wow wow","5","2016-05"
"Ten star... and above","Certainly, Dubai is one of the most luxurious country in the world. Experience luxury even you have no money.

"Cocktail in the Gold on 27","Stunning views and very friendly staff. Our hotel booked us a reservation easy to get to and was able to walk around the lobby area before going up to 27 floor.  We had only had the one drink whilst watching the sun set over Dubai well worth a visit.","5","2016-05"
"A wonderful birthday weekend!","Although we live in Dubai, I wanted to do something special for my lovely husband's 50th birthday, so decided to book us into the beautiful Burj Al Arab!  All I can say is ""Wow!  We had dinner at Al Mahara on the first night.  Yes, it was expensive, but the attention to detail and the delicious food made it well worth the money.
We had a scrumptious buffet at Bab Al Yam the following evening, after spending half the day at Wild Wadi with our daughter!
The service we got from our lovely butler, Alam, was superb!  He ensured everything was perfect for my husband's birthday, and even organised a special cake and a bouquet of roses for the special day, along with guitar accompaniment and staff singing happy birthday in our suite!
I would say the Burj Al Arab is more than a hotel: it's an exceptional experience!","5","2016-05"
"Wow","My 60th a few years back.  Nothing else to say......  If you get the chance to go, then go.  Stunning!  Quality, service, experience, it has it all.  I took a private helicopter tour right from the Helipad on the top floor.  Never will forget it.","5","2016-05"
"Amazing view from the Skyview Bar","I have been to the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea in the hotel overlooking the beach area and it was wonderful. This time I booked the Skyview bar and was not disappointed by the view, it was amazing.
The staff were so informative and very pleasant and helpful. Will definitely return.","5","2016-05"
"Afternoon Tea Burj al Arab Skybar ","Visiting the Burj al Arab had been on my bucket list to visit ever since I first saw it, and not being able to afford to actually stay there the next best thing was to book Afternoon Tea in the Skybar on the 27th Floor.
You need to book in advance for this as you cannot even get past the security gate and onto the Burj al Arab Causeway without a reservation. At 620 Dirhams per head  it is not cheap but still I cannot fault the experience and thought it well worth the money for the experience alone.
If you are celebrating a special occasion be sure to mention it on the booking as they will provide an extra special touch to help you celebrate.
 
Some tables have a view of the Jumeriah Beach Hotel and the Burj Khalifa but most are the view out to sea with the Palm on your left, but you are free to walk around and take photos, even in the Dining Area that is closed off for evening meals.
You are assigned a personal waiter who explains each course in detail as it is served to you.
It includes a glass of Champagne, but only the one, if you want another one they are £26 a glass. Afternoon tea is served as several separate courses with the sandwiches and cakes pastries served on distinctive Burj al Arab shaped servers. Make sure you go with a healthy appetite as there is plenty on offer,  be wary of having second helpings of the sandwiches as you might find you don’t have room for the sweet courses.
Tea and Coffee is free-flowing during the experience and the cappuccino came complete with gold dusting on the top.
We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and having mentioned it on the booking our waiter presented us with a Happy Anniversary Chocolate Cake and an exquisite rose for the occasion.
Service at the Burj is second to none, nothing is too much trouble and when my husband said he would like a copy of the actual menu they printed it all off for us and presented it in an embossed envelope for us to take away.
If you want drinks from the bar this is also possible, but be aware of the additional costs, my husband had a glass of London Pride and it added £17 to our bill.
 
The experience lasts around 2 hours in total and they have set times for you to book, you are free to look around the public areas of the Burj afterwards and before so take your camera as the interior is like nothing I have seen before.
 
Very glad I have been able to cross this off my list, I was not disappointed in any way, fantastic experience for a special occasion.","5","2016-05"
"Arrive in Style and Fly High","Although we live in Dubai, we had to try the Burj, even if it was for only two nights at $2500. We were picked up at our home by a white Rolls Phantom. Once delivered to the Burj, we were taken immediately to our room. Our private butler showed us around and allowed us to get settled in. We enjoyed the “underwater” restaurant the first evening. The morning of the second day we chartered a helicopter to take us for a tour of city. It took us directly from the roof helipad. The total experience was all perfectly wasteful but the experience felt so good!","5","2016-04"
"Gold on 27 - Thank You!","You know when you really want to eat at Burj Al Arab and you can't seem to get a reservation because they want you to book in advance and you cannot because that's the only day you have and you want to go early to make sure you take beautiful pictures? Then something amazing happens and they tell you they have Gold on 27 and you don't have to spend minimum amount, opened early and you can go anytime from 5? That's what happened and they did not disappoint. Cocktails are on point, customer service is top notch, pictures for social media slaying and everything and everyone treats you like you are the queen? Yes, that's what this place was.
And the view? Mhh ....That pretty much sums it. Thank you!","5","2016-04"
"very high tea indeed!","The view is absolutely amazing, it's expensive but i think it's well worth it. The food is plenty since you can have as much as you want. The viennoiseries are not the best that i've tasted but it's ok. The tea and coffee are good. There are many flavors of tea and coffee to choose from. Make sure you have your booking reservation with you to show them at many check points! they sure don't want anyone to wander off where they are not supposed to be....","5","2016-04"
"Incredible service and memorable experience","We stayed here recently for my husband's big birthday and were completely blown away. We can't wait to come back again next year with our kids.

This is one hotel that must be experienced to appreciate why it's one of its kind. From the moment we arrived to the time we departed I couldn't fault a thing. We stayed in a one bedroom suite that's split over two levels. It's designed so that you have a luxurious study, spacious living and dining room area on the ground level and bedroom with a stunning view of the Arabian Gulf and Jumeirah coastline upstairs. 

The butlers on our floor - Bashir, Sajan & Bryan - couldn't do enough for us. Really,  
everyone generally seamed very nice and helpful. 

There is good selection of restaurants and the food was amazing. Even the omelette in Bab Al Yam restaurant tasted special with fresh ingredients. But my favorite has to be the infinity pool in the spa - definitely a pool with the best view of Dubai coastline and skyline!

By the way, you don't have to be staying in the hotel to dine at any of the restaurants here. Reserve before you go though otherwise you won't get past security. We highly recommend at least trying out the high tea in the Skyview Bar and drinks in the 'Gold on 27' bar the next time you are in Dubai.

"Flight of Fantasy - Dinning at its best","Spent the evening with my wife sampling the signature dishes in all of Burj's fine dinning restaurants having taken up the ""Flight of Fantasy - Dinning Experience"" while in Dubai.

What can I say other than WOW.....

Starting in the sky bar any working you way downwards through all the fine dinning experiences and along the way treated like 7 star royalty makes the expedature more than worth it.

Once in a lifetime experience if you like food and have £800 to splash as a couple and your in Dubai it's a must do experience.","5","2015-12"
"Junsui","I visited Burj Al Arab with a restaurant reservation at Junsui.  Our waiter, Vikram Singh, treated us like royalty.  Not only was Vikram a wonderful waiter, he obtained special permission at my request to see the pool area and another restaurant - areas that are off limits to restaurant guests.  Vikram made the trip to Burj Al Arab so special.  Thank you Vikram.","5","2016-04"
"High tea","I only looking to see how's look symbolic building 
Wow it's amazingly designed. 
Gold every wher I love it... main thing beach and middle on water where building stand, 7star service so little expensive, worth To visit.","5","2016-05"
"Incredible Service","We had always wanted to try the Burj Al Arab after admiring it from a distance on our many trips to Dubai before and decided to stay for 3 nights during the F1 GP in Abu Dhabi last November. There is really not much we couldn't love about our stay at the Burj Al Arab, being able to enter as a guest so it isn't overcrowded with curious tourists is a great start. We had a beautiful two level suite which was so luxuriously furnished and decorated, we thought we were in a palace. Having a dedicated butler for the small number of suites on our floor was also a great service as we were able to organise anything required with him directly and was always on hand to check on us for anything we needed. 
Of course this isn't the cheapest hotel in Dubai but to enjoy this level of service and exclusivity comes at a price which I think is worth it. The restaurants were very good, particularly the Al Mahara Seafood Restaurant with its impressive aquarium backdrop to enjoy whilst dining. The concierge desk was also very helpful with transfers and organising a few tours for us.
All in all, a very memorable experience for us and one hotel that we will look forward to staying at again one day soon.  ","5","2015-11"
"Dream Come True","There is no other way to describe my stay at The Burj, other than to say, it is definitely the best hotel in the world.
The suites are suburb, extreme luxury, but still comfortable, they are all 2 storey with  amazing views.
Service is faultless, the genuine sincerity of ALL staff including cleaners is second to none, they made you feel at home and extremely safe.
I'am a lady in my late sixties travelling alone, so this was important to me.
Nothing was too much trouble, you had a question or query, they would find an answer, no matter how difficult it appeared.
The food in the restaurants was the best I have ever experienced, an amazing variety  of all cuisine's.
All suites have their own 24/7 Butler service, these gentleman surpass any expectations one may have.
Room service was prompt, the room was attended to twice a day for cleaning purposes.
There are ladies, mens and mixed pools, in the ' ladies only pool' the attention to detail was unmatched,every time the Spa needed turning back on an attendant was there to save you the trouble.
Given the opportunity I would return tomorrow . ( I can only wish)
From now on, accommodation , no matter where in the world, will never be the same, no hotel could ever reach the heights of The Burj Al Arab.

"Seven Star High Tea ","Attended the High Tea for a 2 hour treat of great food, excellent views of the Dubai coast, all in a very, very pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. Although it is a typical 'tourist ' attraction, the feeling is one of grandeur. Very professional and friendly staff. Great quality of food and drinks. Really great experience!","5","2016-02"
"Huge beautiful building, but common operation and service,","I've not mentioned and post yet. Coz it was my upset experience. 
Such a seven stars hotel of symbol of Dubai. We did real look forward to stay. 
But hotel staff was just a staff. Not professional butler and they were Not ladies and gentlemen. 
Order was Not Certsinly, operation was wrong: dinner reservation was wrong arranged and we got delay call, when I go out to shopping got a call from restaurant. 
Private beach was Not seven stars one, Worker was lazy. Hope finish yet, there were some construction the front of beach it made spoil to beautiful appearance and picture. 
Some guests looked not suit for this hotel, noisy and against dress code, poor behaviour... Made stay mess. 
I said empty hotel. Sure building is gorgeous and beautiful, deco and facility was fine ok. 
Happy was I spent beautiful girls night with my beautiful guest of female friend at bar. 

Emptiness and prosperity? What's real?","3","2016-02"
"A must-see in Dubai","I went here with some friends for cocktails in the bar up at the top. The drinks were phenomenal. Probably some of the most interesting and fancy drinks I've had anywhere in the world. The view of Dubai was amazing at night. The lobby and the fountains are out of this world. There is a little smoking lounge in the basement which is kind of cool to check out. Absolutely stunning architecture.","5","2016-04"
"Waste of Money","Very overpriced and certainly not justifiable. - seven stars. Hotel is relatively small and the location keep you isolated. Maybe good for somebody who really needs to say ""I stayed there"". 
I think the staff is well-trained but the service overall is European and not suitable for the fast pace that most Americans desire. The style of the hotel made me feel is if I was in Disneyland. There are many beautiful hotels in Dubai that have a lovely blend of Eastern and Western architecture. But I found this hotel to physically resemble a bizarre version of Disneyland. I'm sorry to say this but I was rather put off at not being able to see why the prices are so inflated. Both the Ritz and Marriott have a few hotels in Dubai and I have stayed there. Those hotels are  more suited to an American who is not worried about cost, yet not willing to bring cash.","1","2016-04"
"Ideal for a special occasion!","Went for the second sitting at 4pm at the top for afternoon tea. Rang and booked same day, english speaking on the phone, very easy to do. Greeted at the bottom and taken up in the lift, unbelievable view from your table, plenty of room you dont feel like your all eating on top of each other. Plenty of staff and extremely good service. Hefty price but everything included unless you upgrade to different champagne etc. Enough food to fill, we expected small snacks and came away full! Rose for special occasion, cake for birthdays. Taxi back easily found outside. ","4","2016-05"
"Stunning Hotel but a one off at the price","We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and 7 nights at the Jumeirah Beach for the Dubai World Cup Horse racing and really thought it was stunning, our room was a panoramic view suite over looking the beach, split on two levels it is the best hotel room we have ever stayed in, so much space it was like having your on apartment in the gulf, as you walked in to the room we thought it was where we checked in however it was the entrance hall to our lounge, with an amazing sweeping staircase going up to the our huge bedroom, however I do think it is overpriced and would only stay back at the Jumeirah Beach but it was great to experience it.","5","2016-03"
"Luxury Burj with awesome food","Burj al arab make its name alive by giving best service ever, Specially food. I ate some veg Arabian dishes. Which are delicious enough to make you mad about food. But before planeed for burj al arab you must check your pocket and budget. Its luxury with awesome food. If you wanna eat delicious then you have to pay for it.","5","2016-02"
"One off experience","The moment you set foot inside Burj you feel very special knowing that you are staying in one of the worlds finest hotels. The suites are huge and the layout of ours was lovely with the bedroom areas upstairs . Butlers were very helpful. Views are like nothing else with floor to ceiling Windows . The suites decor however is very dated and in real need of updating. The restaurants are all excellent quality , our favorite bring the Asian one. The. Underground restaurant al mahatma is outstanding with stunning aquarium set inside and fine dining cuisine. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The pool on site is so small we went to the beach instead which was lovely and well serviced, they are building a new pool extension so hopefully that will help for those who prefer pools. The skyview bar is fantastic for evening drinks before dinner with extensive birds eye views of Dubai and the palm area. The spa was a bit disappointing , treatment was great but the area where we sat prior to our couples treatment was a dark small area like a waiting area at a doctors surgery ! The hair salon did me a wash and blow dry which was great but at the equivalent price of $200 is extortionate ! It's still only water shampoo & conditioner ... And about 30 minutes time in total , so how they get that price is a mystery ! There are lots of huge parties of tourists who come for day trips taking photos .. This is a little annoying when you are trying to relax yourself on holiday. Feels a bit like a Disney tour on site ! All in all feel lucky to have experienced this beautiful hotel but prefer other properties nearby owned by the same group, also miss the balcony with room facility. Much prefer the  Talise spa at Al  Quasr hotel nearby.","5","2016-03"
"Afternoon tea with a view!","Booked afternoon tea in the Sky Bar as a treat for 60th birthday and daughter moving to Oz. Ladies dress up and made it a special occasion. It is a 7 star hotel. !

Great views from the window table we had. Champagne to start followed by sandwiches, cakes, sorbet, unlimited (non alcohol) drinks. Expensive but worth the trip. Sunset over the sea spectacular.","5","2016-04"
"Wonderful","We have been in Dubai for 4 days. And the day that we visit Burj Al Arab was one of the best! Wonderful architecture! Wonderful view! It's a tall Burj at all. Waw! No words to describe... Good job!!!!","5","2016-04"
"Pure indulgence ","Stayed in the two bedroom delux suite, room was fabulous with plenty of space and views to die for, 
We made use of the spa and can quite honestly say what a pleasure this truly was.
All members of staff have been very welcoming and have gone out of there way to meet our needs, 
This is truly a trip of a life time. ","5","2016-05"
"Unpleasant stay ","We were a group of 14 people visiting Dubai for my birthday celebration. We stayed at Kempinski mall of Emirates for 5 nights which I would recommend, they are quite new, staff are friendly. Then during the last night we stayed at Burj Al Arab which was an unpleasant night for all of us.

We booked 3 rooms ( one panoramic , 2 deluxe suite ), they are generous enough to upgrade our panoramic room to a club suite by Anthony Mchale. In terms of room size, it is plenty of space but in terms of service , I don't think it is a 7 star service but more a 7 star price only. 

When we checked in, I was with my family and a friend total 14 of us , but only 7 of us are staying in the hotel ( 3 rooms ). They didn't mention by 12am our family and friends had to leave the hotel , so after dinner, my family and friends came back to our rooms wanting to have a drink and continue my celebration but their staff Daniela Bogdanovska and Fatima knocked on our room at 11:20pm at night and lectured us saying my guests had to leave immediately . I told them we are celebrating my birthday so they won't leave right now but rather after some drinks and told them they really should have informed us when we checked in so we could have planned better our night. Daniela was not very friendly , basically told us ' if we told you your friends had to leave at 12am at check in , you would have been upset anyway so we didn't ' they also tried to make us to sign a piece of paper called ' voucher ' and guaranteed if they don't leave by 12am they will charge us AED 1800 per person. I booked 3 rooms , paying a 7 star hotel price and stayed in a so-called 7 star hotel, is that how we are supposed to be treated ? Daniela and Fatima further did something outrageous , Daniela told me my aunts ( 60+ years old ) pushed her colleague in the afternoon on the corridor!!!which my aunts told me there was no such thing!!!! The next morning, I made a complaint to their duty manager, She was much more reasonable and tried to fix the damage, however, it was a tough job as Daniela and Fatima had literally destroyed our last night . I told the duty manager to pls check the security camera and as I wanted to make sure and confirm my aunts didn't push anyone. She later came back and confirmed to me the camera didn't record any pushing . That was a very bad accusation to the guests , I am still very upset with the whole incident and I will not stay in the hotel again and I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay there. I find most of their staff are not friendly, they expect tips for every move they do for you , their breakfast was very poor, had to ask 3 times to get my tea, range of food is limited. 

For the same amount of money, I could have stayed in a 5 star hotel nice suite with more professional service and better breakfast. And I have ever had anyone like that Daniela and Fatima to have told me off about having friends over in my room for drinks???!! And my aunts being accused pushing their staff!!!!

I am still waiting for their duty manager to get back to me on that incident, as I would not allow my aunts being accused by them.

"Still the World's Best Luxury Hotel!"," I have been a guest at the Burj al Arab every couple of years over the last few years. And yet every time I come to the Burj, I desire to return. There are many great hotels in the world. There are many great hotels in Dubai. But for the Burj, any one of these other hotels could be the world's best. But the Burj is in a class by itself. There is the Burj and then there are all of the other hotels. The Burj does it with its unmatched hard product- every room is at least a duplex one bedroom suite (many are two and three bedroom suites), beautiful spa, pool and beach and a variety of restaurants serving distinctly delicious food.  But what really sets the Burj apart is its unrivalled soft product-its service and its people. A team of polished butlers outside your door 24 hours to fulfill nearly any request. Every employee greets you with a smile, many by your name. This is what differentiates the Burj. And this is how the Burj is able to become not only the hotel in a destination, but the destination itself! And this is the most sought after branding accomplishment, yet the most difficult to achieve. Since the Burj is firmly anchored with luxury hotel veterans such as Mr. Ahmed Ereiba and Ms. Stephanie Zawada, I am sure that it will continue to be the World's Best Luxury Hotel for years to come!","5","2016-05"
"3 Stars at best-broken TV, hot tub, curtain, dining room lights, iPad, lax security","It was with great disappointment as we left the Burj al Arab, as my parents, especially my father, had his hopes up for over a decade after hearing about the 7 star level treatment when his friends had stayed at the Burj 10 plus years ago. It did not live up to his nor any of my family members' expectations on this 40th anniversary for them, from the curt and mostly unreachable service from our second Butler to the hardware malfunctions within the room (broken TV, hottub, curtain, dining room lights, nonfunctioning ipad) to the lax security (access door left open in pantry to the outside at night)...we were, to say the least, very underwhelmed by what should have been representative of the best Dubai has to offer. Things that should be in working order for even a 3 star hotel were not working at the Burj, which is a shame, and also, a waste of our time and money.

I am a long-time Marriott gold member and my stay experience at the nearby Dubai Harbour Marriott far exceeded the one at the Burj, for a fraction of the price. From the smiles to the service attitude to the personalized attempt to address my parents to the knowledgeable concierge, ALL outstrip the Burj by more than 3 stars. If the Burj were 7 stars, the Marriott should be 10 or more by our account.","2","2016-04"
"Sky high","Went here for high tea initially thought expensive but the whole experience from the hotel the lift and of course the sky bar views unbelievable food excellent a must to do in dubai if anything left over ask for doggy bag","5","2016-05"
"Amazing Hotel","The only 7 star hotel in the UAE. Reception is an experience unto itself. You get spoiled from the minute you walk on the premises. While we were being checked in, we were treated to a cold towel, dates and arabic coffee. We were then escorted to our suite, where we were met by our own personal butler. The hotel is huge and very ornate. Beautiful. No expense or detail was spared in it's construction. It is truly a unique and magnificent hotel. Having a butler means you don't have to lift a finger. Needs are anticipated and requests accommodated seamlessly. Their motto is ""You won't want to leave."", which is very appropriate. Extensive fitness, spa and pool facilities. Private beach. If you want to know what 7 Star means, I recommend you stay here.","5","2016-04"
"Visit the Icon","This is an icon in Dubai

They do not give you the VIP treat there, they serve you like you are the owner of the place
gold everywhere... the story says that nobody knows the value of the gold there since there was so many modifications and renovations, they just lost track
The food is 5 stars, the view is a WOW
Worth every fils you pay there","5","2016-04"
"7 Star/Diamond Be Treated As A Royal","The experience provided to guests at Burj Al Arab is nothing short of flawless Royal treatment. Truly a seven star, seven diamond hotel that seems to have a staff to guest ratio of 1:1. Be whisked away in a lovely Rolls-Royce from the airport to the hotel, where you are greeted by name in a speedy private check-in. Arrive in your state of the art suite, everything is touch of a button operation, where your personal butler for your stay welcomes you and learns of what assistance he can be. The staff are very friendly and see to your every need. There training is top notch, very upstairs/downstairs.

 The food is a culinary tour de force. The finest wine list I've ever encountered. Some of the finest pastry chefs on earth. There creations and sugar art are a treat to behold in themselves. You can only experience this level of culinary bliss in Dubai. Savor this experience.

Your butler can arrange for anything you desire. The hotel can arrange for a personal shopper that can guide you to the exact jewelry store for the item you are looking for. Need a fitting for suits? Done. A week of this service makes you feel like a Royal. Hermes bath products, 2,000 thread count sheets, blackout the room at the touch of a button, spa treatments that are one of a kind, this is not a resort hotel but a true luxury experience.","5","2015-08"
"Wow wow wow","This is the BEST hotel I have visited. From stepping out of our transfer you are greeted with the friendliest of greetings. Golf buggies to jumeirah beach or madinat shopping and dining area are all complimentary. Our room situated on the 15th floor was perfect in every sense. Each floor having its own butler service 24/7. The views of jumeirah beach and Dubai city are awesome. Love this place 👍😊","5","2016-04"
"Nasty experience","Went to the Skybar with my husband and friends last Sunday evening at 9 pm for cocktails and canapés. Both were wonderful , but within 2 hours of eating/ drinking and whilst still there , I experienced a very sharp pain in my upper abdomen . This very quickly developed into a very bad case of food poisoning and I had one of the worst nights of my life. I didn't eat for the next 2 days as I felt so unwell and have contacted the hotel by email ,expressing my dismay , but have not had a response from them . I hope someone will read this review and contact me as could not believe that I had this experience at this amazing hotel. We were staying at the Zabeel Saray, part of the same hotel group","1","2016-04"
"The height of Luxury","From the moment we arrived everything about the people and the hotel was faultless. It's jaw dropping design and finish is matched only by the staff who are attentive, knowledgeable and polite. I think there were as many staff as guests! Food was terrific in choice and quality. Definitely one of the 99 things to do before you die.","5","2016-04"
"It isn't 7* without reason!!","From the moment you step into the Rolls Royce that takes you onto the island where the hotel is situated, you know your heading for a world of luxury.

"Amazing stay - everything was just perfect and better than I ever imagined!","I don't really know what to say except that I was just blown away... I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and been impressed by the service, rooms, facilities etc but I can understand why the Buj is rated as a ""7* hotel"" as there are lots of little extra touches that made our stay really special. 

There is so much to comment on so sorry this will be a long review. 

Part of me was a little worried before arriving that it may have been a little pretentious and a bit OTT but how wrong was I! Don't get me wrong there is no expense spared when it comes to the decor, the hotel cars, the facilities, even the toiletries but everywhere is immaculate and I actually loved the decor, design etc.

On arrival in Dubai we decided to use the hotel car rather than the Emirates chauffeur and it was lovely when we were greeted at the airport and I was handed flowers by the driver.  
We also used the hotel cars to go out in the evening - the drivers were always so polite and even when we booked at last minute they always sorted a car very quickly for us. We were also able to call them at the end of our night to pick us up which saved getting in a random taxi. We mainly had the BMWs which were nice but also had a Rolls Royce which was very special!

On arrival at the hotel we were very impressed with the incredible hotel lobby - the fish tanks, the water features and the shops are all very cool.  Just amazing looking up in the atrium too! There were always staff available, no matter the time of day, should you need assistance both in the lobby and even on the door. Always greeted with a smile too! During the day the lobby can get a bit busy with what felt like tourists but it didn't really bother us. 

We arrived at the hotel about 1am and everything was taken care of which was nice as we were so tired. We were taken straight up to our floor and I don't even remember checking in as we were pretty much shown straight to our room as they were expecting us 

Our room was amazing (1605) & I think they are all over 2 floors so I guess it pretty much comes down to the view etc but our suite was beautiful. Luggage arrived quickly and although we were tired we decided to crack open the bottle of chilled champagne left for us. There were also chocolates and a lovey full fruit bowl. 

The room was huge and downstairs we had a small bathroom, desk with a Mac PC, bar area, table and chairs and a huge sitting room with big comfy sofas and a big tv. There was also a sound system to plug in an iPod etc for music across the 2 floors so felt like home! Up the sweeping staircase was the dressing area with plenty of storage for two of us and a couple of big mirrors. 

The bathroom was amazing! Huge shower and huge bath complete with Hermes toiletries for him and her! All free to use! My boyfriend was impressed with the shaving kit as it was a Gillette razor - although they don't cost a fortune it makes such a difference having this over a rubbish 2 blade plastic razor. (He is hard to please and he thought this along with the Hermes shampoo, shower gel & fragrance was worth staying in the hotel for!!)

Onto the bedroom... Huge and very comfortable. Incredible view too!
We had a lounge area with comfortable sofa and chair and the bed was just amazing - slept so peacefully every night. During the day they make the bed and it looks so lovely after a day by the pool with the cushions etc then when they do the turn down service they remove all the cushions and throw and leave little gifts for him and her on the bed. 

The team looking after us on the 16th floor were so lovely and took the time to chat to us. They were observant too so would fit in cleaning our room when they knew we would be out of the room for a couple of hours as it takes 90 minutes apparently!

If we ever needed anything or just needed to know how something worked we would call and within a minute someone was there to assist!

We loved the drinks trolly that came round early evening offering a range of drinks and we also bumped into a sweet trolly offering pick and mix for the kids. 

Every member of staff we came across during our stay was polite, friendly, nothing was too much trouble and they genuinely cared. 

The breakfast buffet was very good. Lots of choice and all the food was really good quality. The smoothies were really good and we tried the pancakes and eggs benedict which were perfectly cooked. Lots of fresh fruit on offer and cold hams, cheese etc. 

We had lunch in the pool restaurant one day as we missed breakfast (we didn't realise it was on until 11.30!) & because I had a bag the waiter came over with a little handbag holder so my bag didn't need to go on the floor. It's the little touches that make all the difference. 

I love Jumeriah group as have stayed in other hotels in the group in Dubai & when you get to the pool they bring you a cool box with chilled water and cold face cloths which you need in the Dubai heat. I know this may sound minor but the towels for the sun loungers were so good too as they were full length and didn't fall down or move around. There were always loads of fresh towels by the pool too for after swimming etc. 

The pool, although not massive, was a good temperature and perfect for a little bit of swimming to cool off!  It looks like they are building a huge extension at the back of the hotel with a much bigger pool although not entirely sure if that is the case but it would be amazing if it was.  The pool bar staff were brilliant and kept up well hydrated with lots of G&Ts!

We went to the beach a couple of times and this was also a great place to relax.  There are loungers, soft seating and cabanas if you prefer to be on one bed. We loved the bar area and tried the restaurant one day too. The seafood platter and wine was very good! Such a perfect setting looking back at our hotel. 
There are private shower facilities at the beach too if you want to freshen up before lunch with fresh towels and toiletries. 

We popped into the gym and I also tried out the indoor pool too. They have both a mixed gym/pool and a ladies only gym/pool. The gym was huge and very well equipped with everything you could possibly need & more!  I went to the indoor pool and enjoyed relaxing as well as swimming for a morning. The changing facilities were huge and had cleanser/toner/creams etc and anything they didn't have you just had to ask. Plenty of bottled water was available and they even had little shots of fresh juice!

While staying at the hotel my boyfriend surprised me with a helicopter trip as the weather wasn't great one day. The team on our floor arranged it on the day and even managed to keep it a secret from me until we were escorted up to the roof!  It is was an amazing experience and one I will never forget. Just amazing flying from the Burj helipad. Our pilot was informative during our flight and we saw all the main tourist attractions in Dubai. Would recommend!!!  On landing we were welcomed with cold drinks :)
The hotel can offer heli transfers which we were going to do but unfortunately they don't fly at night or very early in the morning. 

During our stay we sampled the sky bar which although expense was nice and had great views! We also went to Al Muntaha and did the tasting menu with wine pairing. This was really really good - the food and wine was perfect and the waiters were very knowledgeable.  The views were brilliant too and for our dessert we were offered a different table so that we could take in the other view. 

Overall I would recommend this hotel if you can afford it. My boyfriend is very hard to please and has stayed in so many amazing hotels and he said he will stay here every time he visits Dubai in the future. I loved every minute and was so sad to leave but cannot wait to return (if I am ever that lucky again!)

"Great experience highly recommended","We came to Burg Al Arab to see this famous hotel and weren't disappointed. We made reservations at the Skybar just as the sun was setting. The views from the top floor are really amazing.  We knew it wasn't going to be cheap given the 350 AED pp min spend, but, actually it seemed reasonable given that the specialty cocktails are really quite special and tasty. Our server was a cosumate professional with excellent knowledge of the very diverse cocktail menu.  Our overall experience was definitely worth it and recommended.","5","2016-04"
"Luxury Luxury Luxury!!!","The Berj is something that you simply have to do if you can at least once when visiting Dubai. The opulence and luxury of the rooms and the entire complex is second to none and the service certainly makes every single person feel like royalty. The pool and beach are lovely (you will be driven by buggy to the private beach back across the bridge). Sky view bar is a must, as is the aquarium restaurant.","5","2015-05"
"Luxury, must to try","It was very pleasant and happy trip to stay with such a luxury name. Once you enter you can feel the difference that why it's famous... Every detail has been fabulously taken care. It's very promising and reliable services which makes their name and they deserve it.. The view, facilities and atmosphere.... I loved it.. But what make me feel great about this place is their people... They are always there with a smile to make sure that your stay if going smooth... It's a great asset for this place... Love to be back... Looking forward to stay with you soon.","5","2016-03"

"""Words are not enough""","Another wonderful trip to this wonderful hotel and family with us this time. ALL the staff we encountered seemed happy in their jobs and remembering us. Cannot wait for the new North Deck to open soon as that will be another fantastic part to the hotel as we spend a lot of time at the pool and the lovely Abbas is soo kind looking after us and he was good with our baby granddaughter. Breakfast at Bab Al Yam was wonderful and Satish and the team look after us too. Dinner in Al Iwan was as always wonderful. Lovely 2 bedroom suite on the 20th floor with fab views over the city. We will again be back BAA. Thank you","5","2016-03"
"Incedible experience!","We went for cocktails for 60th Birthday to the Skyview bar. There is a minimum spend of around £65 a head but as you can imagine in a 7 star hotel a couple of drinks a piece will soon hit this. The greeting from all the staff was fantastic, they make you feel very special. We booked well in advance and requested a window table which we were lucky enough to get. The menu for drinks is a little confusing but the drinks were great! We went off piste and requested my wife's favourite cocktail Brandy Alexander, which they made perfectly. We didn't ask the price and were pleasantly surprised that it was cheaper than any of their cocktails.

The canapés and nibbles were excellent and they restocked them for us. As it was my birthday I got a nice little birthday cake from them too.
As you can imagine the service was outstanding, the views were incredible, and we were not rushed at all. We spent some time looking around other areas of this stunning hotel and taxis were plentiful too.

Overall an amazing experience and a ""must do"" when you visit Dubai.","5","2016-04"
"all u have to see it again and again","dubai is a world place were every body enjoys and love to come again and again. hotel  burj al arab is said as the eleven wonder of world all in one roof as royally place for ever green always and most beautiful.....","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon tea in the Sky View Bar","Need to pre-book visit as a booking reference is required to get in the gate, literally.  A luxurious, special occasion treat. Hotel an architectural masterpiece.  Food and service were as one would expect - excellent. We booked the 4pm tea service and only recommendation for first time visitors would be to be to ask for seating looking toward the old city as this is the most spectacular view and the setting sun is not a factor.  And..... don't have lunch before or book dinner after.","5","2016-04"
"Fantastic place with great service","We had breakfast in the Asian Restaurant and the service from the time you get off the vehicle 
Is fantastic. From the Doorman to the greeting staff are all very good and oblige with taking photos etc;. The restaurant staff too were excellent special mention of Janeth who looked after us and taking care of one of our special dietary needs as well. We had a nice table by the window . The food was good . Would love to go back one day. ","5","2016-04"
"1001 Arabian Nights...","My wife and I had high tea at the Skyview Bar (27th Floor): it was spectacular! I made reservations from my home town (Los Angeles) 2 weeks in advance in order to get a window seating. At out arrival, the staff made sure that our experience was ""out of this world"". We remain seating at our table for over 2 hours, while the sun was setting down and all the city lights shimmered. The cost is over $150 per person, the experience invaluable...Not to be missed.","5","2016-02"
"Must do","Im living part Dubai part UK.

So every time I'm in Dubai I always find myself here and admiring the hotel. 
Weather I'm at the beach or residing at this hotel, I just can't get enough of it. 

If your tourist and have been to Dubai and haven't seen the Burj'Al'Arab then you haven't lived lol

The service at this hotel is simply impeccable that I don't have the need to write any further. 

This place is a travellers dream and fast becoming the number one Honeymoon destination.","5","2016-04"
"Worth it","Yes this hotel is a little more expensive than most other hotels, but it is worth it. You get what you pay for. It is beautiful, tranquil, luxurious and all other words that describe something that is simply amazing.","5","2015-10"
"Wow!","Afternoon tea with my family was an out if this world experience. Wonderful friendly staff, beautifully presented food, great selection of hot and cold drinks and a view to die for. We had champagne to start with then went on to sample many of the teas on offer. There was no rush and the choice of food was amazing. My daughter required a gluten free menu and the selection of dishes presented to her were imaginative and plentiful. Would thoroughly recommend as a ""must do"" experience in Dubai. The Burj al Arab Hotel was so amazing we really did not want to leave. Yes it was expensive but worth every penny or dirham!","5","2016-04"
"Oppulence at its grandest","My husband and I were very lucky to experience staying at this extravagant hotel for one night as it is was a gift given to us for Xmas by our family. I was very happy that the hotel allowed our children to come and visit and enjoy our room and the experience with us. Arrival at reception is very much made to make you feel like royalty. Staff are only to willing to help and always greet you with a smile.The rooms are all duplex suites very grand, very spacious and with a spiral staircase that takes you to your bedroom with magical views and bathroom with a full size jacuzzi. The butler is there is to make your experience even more grand. We were given chocolates, canapés, beautiful red roses and of course the full size Hermes amenities with his and her perfumes. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for breakfast. We did have drinks in the lounge. Definitely a once in a lifetime experience if your able to","5","2016-03"
"Amazing undersea restaurant","We stayed in Dubai last November and I had a wish list of the things I wanted to do. One of which was dinner at the burj al Arab. Our hotel could book standard restaurant easily but I wanted the better option so booked online for the underwater restaurant set menu. The experience was amazing but to this day other than the black squid ink rolls we can't remember what we ate!
When I booked they advised s jacket was required for men, the BF hadn't packed one so we went and bought one. On the evening it was really hot and he questioned taking it but I insisted he st least take it with us if not wearing it. Taxis are not allowed to cross the bridge to get to the hotel unless you have a booking- further adding to the exclusivity! We were greeted and informed he needed to wear his jacket, which I was pleased about as kept the standards up. Escorted to the special lift and down we went to the underwater restaurant. An amazing experience, more for one dinner than I pay for my mortgage but so worth it :)","5","2015-11"
"DON'T BOOK with ""GET YOUR GUIDE"" to go up the Burj","Don't book with the German web site Get Your Guide, they are the worst communicators, their site pressures you to believe tickets are limited and they didn't deliver my tickets in time for the tour.
There are plenty of tickets at the Burj available in the Mall and whilst can be crowded due to popularity, pre-purchased tickets from companies like 'Get Your Guide' are a headache, as you need to queue twice to use them.
DON'T BOOK WITH ""GET YOUR GUIDE"" - Please!!!","4","2016-04"
"Pure heaven, it has literally changed our lives","So we got married on the 8th August 2015 and jetted off to Dubai the day after.As part of our dream honeymoon we wanted to stay at the Burj al Arab even if it was just for one night. I booked the hotel for one night 2 years in advance and spoke to a gentlemen called namal during that time to ensure it was a perfect experience with surprises along the way for my husband. I saved and saved and booked the experience in the restaurant underneath surrounded by an aquarium with a 10 course meal champagne concierge etc and I also booked is for a spa treatment and midnight swim with the upper swimming pool all to ourselves so how did it go.
From the moment we were picked up at the Atlantis in a rolls Royce perfection had started , the driver of our car and the luggage van were amazing , they gave us drinks and let us choose what ever music we liked, they opened the doors for us , gave me a bouquet of red roses, congratulated is on getting married and gave us a guided tour on the way to the Burj amazing.
Then we arrived to be treated by the manager and 2 foot men and a concierge outside , they and I had flowers for us it was spectacular, they knew our names opened the door I've never felt more welcome in my life and the general manager of the Burj is a complete sweetheart what an amazing man.
We went through to be greeted by a further five members of staff with tea, have towels drinks etc all lined up and our own lady to check us in and our own butlers to look after is throughout our stay.
From that moment on we had champagne flowing , complimentary canapés, an upgrade to the most amazing room in the world, a tour of the hotel, a rise petal led jacuzzi ran for us with candels lit all the way up the stair case and roses everywhere inc petals on the bed.
The chef spent time with me designing the evening menu with my Husbands favourites in mind and we had lunch on the sky view restaurant again being told anything is possible at the Burj and it is they cooked us burgers fries and garlic bread and it was the best I've ever had.
They steamed and pressed our clothes for the evening and escorted us everywhere even thinking of it now it brings me to tears of joy how they made us feel.
I can not stress enough that I would rather spend the money on one night here to a week away, the experience is a once in a life time.
You do not have to be rich to be treated like a queen or king here , I'm a normal hard working lady who used her savings and was treated no differently to Tom cruise who had stayed there just before us.
The hotel exsubes in greatness with the colours fountain and gold, I just wished we could have had one more night there or the next day as there were so many things we didn't see and we didn't get to use the outside pool or in fact go outside or the water park as we were so bizzy in the hotel.
One of the main things for us is that I'm writing this review from my hospital bed as we wil be expecting our 1st baby over the next few weeks that we conceived at the Burj.
We can not wait to show the new member of the Burj family off and the hotel were so excited we will now be madly saving to try and be able to go on our anniversary or either 1 or 2 years to be able to show all the staff and management the new baby.
Please please please go to the most amazing hotel in the world it's 7 stars for a reason and worth every single penny - just stunning Rebecca Newell ","5","2015-08"
"Just amazing!","My partner took us to the Burj Al Arab for dinner and I was so impressed and blown away with absolutely everything, the architecture, the staff, the ambiance, the food, it was all just so perfect. My partner proposed to me that evening which was orchestrated by him and the members of staff who just couldn't do enough for you. The whole of the outside was cordoned off from the public for my proposal and I didn't have a clue about it! The staff were fabulous with our children and took them to make their desserts with the chef after the proposal whilst we were able to enjoy a short while to embrace the special moment. An evening we will never forget, thank you! ","5","2016-04"
"Amazing","Friend recommended that if you only do one thing in Dubai, make it afternoon tea. She wasn't wrong. Arrived by taxi & we were greeted by an 'Arabian Prince'. The hotel is beautiful, perhaps a bit over the top but that just makes the experience all the more memorable. The tea was served in a lovely lounge overlooking the sea. We were lucky enough to be there to see the sunset. Afternoon tea is expensive but the food was first class and topped off with an ice cold glass of champagne.","5","2016-02"
"A Bucket List must do","This a Bucket list must do. Its iconic for its food, service and opulence. High tea is a real treat - pricey but a must. Don't go expecting a fill me up pig style menu. This is dining at its best. If you are in this price bracket, then as stay here is a must.","5","2015-05"
"Afternoon Tea at the Skybar - wow!!!","The Burj Al Arab is now an iconic landmark in Dubai and during our stay we would occasionally see it appear as part of the skyline during taxi rides etc, it's an imposing structure with a presence and I was also conscious that during our hotel search ( we were looking at what I consider to be at the expensive end of the spectrum - we eventually booked a suite at Grosvener House hotel) the Burj came up as considerably more expensive than anything else. 
When we visited for afternoon tea at the Skybar, we saw why it is a 7 star hotel , it resembles what I imagine one of Saddam Husseins palaces to look like, gold taps and gold coat pegs in the toilet, in which to get to you have to pass through several luxury diamond and jewellery stores first!!

Once at the end of the atrium, you are checked in and invited into the glass lift, this is a great experience as you see the gulf and the Palm structure as you ascend. Once at the top we were showed straight to our seat and although we did not get a window seat we still had a superb view of the downtown area, our waiter then explained the courses and our options and we then enjoyed a 3 hour luxury experience!!

We paid approximately £250.00 total for a 2 person experience and I felt that it was well worth the money!!","5","2016-04"
"Al Iwan Restaurant, first floor Burj Al Arab, Arabic Buffet","We went to this restaurant for diner on my birthday. The food was good, but nothing special. 45 minutes after the meal, we began to feel very ill. It was the worst experience I ever had with a restaurant. Food poissoning.","3","2016-03"
"Fabulous Hotel, unbelievable customer service","This was a family holiday that we had promised ourselves for years and as our son is approaching 17 we thought better do it now as we are running out of time.  We had a 1 bedroomed duplex suite and there was more than enough room for three people.  The hotel is 15 years old now but you would think it had just been completed, the standard of cleanliness and upkeep everywhere is on a standard I have only ever seen at Disney.  We stayed for five nights and had the half board package, this is an excellent deal as the restaurants included are fantastic.  The suite we had was amazing and the Hermes amenities you receive are full size and very nice also.  From the moment you arrive nothing is too much trouble for the staff and they all know your name, I don't know who does their training but it is unbelievable.  The butler we had on the 10th Floor Derry was superb and he would sort everything out for you, he greeted us every day with a smile and was always available to assist.  Also, special mention to Jaffa who came round with G&T every night and was great conversation as we discussed the T20 World Championship.  A fabulous place and well worth making the effort to stay there at least once.  However, we will definitely go back and I would even give up my two weeks annual holiday to stay here for five nights.","5","2016-03"
"Great Experience, the breakfast was subpar","I went for breakfast, like most people just to get inside. I would encourage going for tea. I know this might be american of me, but there would nothing wrong with adding a waffle or some pancakes to the menu. I think the food is cooked already when you order, because my food was cold and when I asked for it to be heated up, they just gave me more.. cold food. The hostess who was from South Africa was amazing. The waitress was a little slow, and did not initially give us back all of our change, we had to go over the bill with her to acknowledge the mistake. The hotel is amazingly beautiful for pictures and taking in the ambiance, but the food was sub par at best. The pastries and fresh juices were great. The burj Al Arab keeps it's mystic by remaining exclusive to visitors, but I have been to a Hilton with better food.","4","2016-03"
"Good but overrated....worth going just to say you've been","We visited for afternoon tea, it was ok nothing special. The best part was the view from the sky bar overlooking the palm and the world island development. The staff were helpful and pleasant......would I rush back?.....shoulder shrug.....whatever","4","2016-04"
"BURG AL ARAB Afternoon Tea Experience to not be missed.","I wanted to create an once-in-a-lifetime memory by treating my husband and I to an ultimate experience at the world’s most luxurious hotel and booked afternoon tea for two at the BURG AL ARAB, Jumeirah, Dubai at the Sky View Bar.  The view of Dubai/Palm (27 floors up) was spectacular and took your breath away.  The food was exempla with some regret have say better than the Ritz in London!  As for service our waiter ‘Zen’ was knowledgeable about all dishes served un intrusively and very happy to replenish everything free (except champagne.)  A little tip book in advance, arrive early and request a window seat (not guaranteed but we were very lucky) to avoid disappointment.  The hotel promise is to provide a dining experience that is unsurpassed in service and quality.  Well it certainly did that and more.","5","2016-03"
"Magnificent","I stayed here for one night 14 years ago so my review is somewhat out of date! It is really hard to put into words the beauty of this building and the one bedroom suite with its marble staircase just blew my mind. 52 carrot gold everywhere, our own butler, amazing views! I suppose the only let down is the outside area but I believe they are working on a new deck at the minute. I am staying at the JBH in July and will look over at the burj enviously, remembering how amazing it was 14 years ago!","5","2015-05"
"Stunning","While on holiday in Ajman, we were booked into the burj for afternoon tea as a joint birthday gift (thanks kids). The whole experience was outstanding from the minute we arrived. The hotel is beautiful and the staff treat everyone with equal courtesy and don't appear to differentiate between day trippers and hotel guests. Walking into the sky bar, the views are just stunning and because we had the 4.30 booking we were able to see Dubai by day and night. The food was wonderful, served by professional, attentive and friendly staff and just when we thought we couldn't eat any more, we were presented with a birthday cake each. Unforgettable day out.","5","2016-03"
"First time here but highly recommended","Was taken here for afternoon tea for my birthday by a friend who lives in Dubai, the staff are probably the best I have encountered on my many trips to Dubai, as although Dubai has many top class hotels, the service can sometimes be a bit erratic depending on where you go so it was lovely to have such attentive staff. The afternoon tea was superb with plenty of choices. Only one small blip my friend asked if I could see the upstairs bar, but apparently they said it was not possible, but would recommend going nevertheless","5","2016-03"
"Birthday Treat","Did the afternoon tea on my 50th birthday for a treat by my friend, went to the sky view bar. We had the best seats in the restaurant, they bought me out a small birthday cake & gave me a rose. Staff were fantastic, very knowledgable, food was amazing & tasty, juices were spectacular. 7 courses all with amazing sandwiches, pastries & scones. There was a harpist playing which added to the atmosphere .Well worth the money","5","2016-03"
"Seven stars is not enough","Stayed one night with my honey at the seven star Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai in a Deluxe one-bedroom suite. We were on a world cruise that had an overnight in Dubai and decided to have a once in a bucket list experience by staying at the Burj. Be sure to have your original passport when you check-in, because copies are not allowed. 

Found a “discounted” rate online and the Burj honored it with a direct reservation. Added the “Winter Dream Package” to our stay that included dinner, two massages, and transportation from the airport or cruise port to the hotel in a BMW 740 sedan and that was a “bargain.” The suite was on two levels with the living room, office, and guest bathroom  on the first level and the bedroom with sitting area and master bathroom with Jacuzzi tub up the spiral staircase. To mention the stay was over the top is an understatement. 

Everything at the Burj is first class from the second we arrived on the private island where the hotel is located. The bottom line is the hotel is really even better than advertised and well worth the cost for one night. We were met at the front door of the Burj by our private Concierge that escorted us to our room to me our Butler. The Concierge checked us in and then the Butler provided any services that we needed to enjoy our experience. All of our communication was directly through the hotel’s website and reservation department and their answers and replies were timely and informative. We especially enjoyed the private tour of the Burj by our Butler, the flowers for my honey that was given by the chauffeur when we were picked up at the cruise port, and the elegant features of the Burj.","5","2016-03"
"OTT but worthwhile going","We went with family and friends. All enjoyed the nice views. Great for afternoon tea. Must be 21 to enter. It's more the whole Burj experience rather than the quality of the food that stays with you. Glad we went though.","5","2015-04"
"Fantastic to see","We turned up but we're unable to enter as we were told we needed a reservation.  However just the view of Burj Al Arab from the beaches was amazing and then we got off the big bus at this stop and was able to see Burj Al Arab much closer.
Impressive!","5","2016-03"
"Unforgettable lunch date","food not at all impressive for the a 7 star hotel and unfortunately, it was not a starred michelin and the price that we paid is very expensive for the food that we had. 

a group of asian was 20 meters away from us and they were talking so loud and no one from the staff asked them to speak with a lower voice.

the waiters need to improve their performance.

regarding the communication with the reservation department, it is too long for burj al arab to reply.","3","2016-03"
"Worth a Decade of Wait!","We've been living in Dubai for more than a decade and we always say that before we go it would be great if we could stay in the Burj Al Arab.  Thank Goodness my husband didn't wait for us to leave before we did get to stay.  It was worth it!  

Such opulence and beauty...and pampering, the 7 stars are well deserved.  From the personal welcome the minute we stepped out of our car to the butlers in the whole floor...truly amazing.

Can't wait to stay again...hopefully, this time not after another decade ☺️","5","2016-03"
"accomadation","first look of all is luxury and great decorating include safely security, but our room at this hotel when stay check in at reception desk didn't got for notice electric is will be down and off working on next morning ,make us a upset so much and didn't dissolve big problem in the better way.","4","2015-04"
"NOT FOR YOUNG COUPLE","we visited this hotel on our honeymoon for 7 nights, the room was beutiful we had a panoromic suite and got picked up from airport in a rolls royce phantom.
entering the hotel was beutiful and walking into the panoromic suite.

The lady checking us in didnt show us around the suite she was more bothered about getting a deposit of us and once she recieved that she dissapeared.

everytime you would walk in and out of the hotel the service of the door staff was very abrupt they would only greet certain people (suited and booted or restaurant users) 

as we were entitle to use the executive pool in jumeirah, we showed them our room key however they would like to ring the hotel to confirm it. (whats that all about) people were just walking in by saying their room numbers we had keys but they had to confirm with the hotel.

the suite we stayed in had problems with the air con/fan extractor. at night when you go sleep the fan would rattle and make noises all night I mean this is meant to be a 7star hotel and you cant even get peacefull night sleep.we just didnt bother to complain being naive and thinking over it now cannot believe I did not speak up specially after all the money we spent and could not sleep all night because of the noise. speakers were not working properly somebody came and made them work however everytime u switch it off you would have the same problem the person would have been better showing us since he knew their was a problem.

at the last day of our stay the concierge was meant to ring us reagarding our tranfer to our other hotel. we rang few times and was told its being dealt with. nobody got back to us untill the driver himself arrived at 4pm. we were sat their waiting only had breakfast at 9am and did not order any food thinking we could get picked up any moment. we did compain to the manager however she just gave us a box of sweets. that was a waste of a day of our holiday.

we visited atlantis hotel for a meal and the service and welcome was so warm in so little space of time we cannot forget.

burj al arab is just hotel where you get looked after if you are a certain person who they may feel like they have to impress and that world speak up.
Ps I have only joined this site today therefore I am making my voice heard.

overall the hotel itself is beutiful. service is a down hill. everybody should get treated fairly everybody should be a customer.

"So near , but yet so far ","I recently returned to the Burj with my wife to celebrate a special birthday . It had been a number of years since our last visit prior to having children ! On arrival we were warmly welcomed and ushered to a lounge for some refreshments whilst we waited a short time for our suite - entirely acceptable due to the fact it was 10am and in the majority of hotel check-in is not until the early afternoon .

Only 10minutes passed and we were shown to our room - we chose a wonderful panoramic suite ,  although the room was beautifully appointed the view was the star of the show . It is  worth noting that the beds are extremely comfortable and the Hermes sundries in the bathroom are an exceptionally nice touch .

My wife then visited the Spa and I went directly to the pool , this unfortunately is where the disappointment started .........

The pool area is under reconstruction due to the addition of the ""north deck"" - I understand that in order to remain one of the worlds best hotels that the Burj must constantly stay at the top of innovation , service and style BUT in my opinion for a major project like this with constant construction noise , areas cordoned off and the additional noise of heavy machinery the Burj should either be closed or at worst pre notifying customers .

With all this construction there are other draw backs , after an hour or two trying to rest at the building site know as the swimming pool we moved to the beach - Jumeirah beaches are renowned for there meticulously clean sand , manicured and presented perfectly every morning . 
BUT not so this time the beach from one end to the other at the waters edge was dirty and scattered with debris worse still in certain areas and oily like residue could be seen in the sand ....... Not a good start to our 6 night stay .

Although the service and style of the hotel both deserve 6 stars and the restaurants a good 5 stars along with the excellent spa , none of this was enough to make up for been woken up by the resounding noise of a 50T pilling hammer echoing through the air every morning from 7.30am . I could go one but in general we tried not to let it ruin our break ....... When we arrived home I was contacted by management but it was too late you can't unfortunately turn back the clock ! 

So in short if your going to claim your the best in the world you have to be consistently the best in the world and not just 90% of the time .","4","2016-03"
"Don't expect nothing special when having breakfast at Bab Al Yam","Although this is a fantastic hotel, breakfast on the pool deck at their restaurant Bab Al Yam is anything but. All you will hear is people complaining that their toast is cold, their coffee hasn't come, their omelette is under or over cooked, etc. I have experienced all of the aforementioned myself to the point where I have walked out of breakfast half way through. I thought that I would share this with trip advisor.","4","2016-03"
"Memorable high tea","A bit pricey but definitely worth the experience. You will end up spending two hours at the top of the hotel with a fantastic view over Dubai, the Palm and the world. Afternoon tea menu includes a glass of high quality champagne and a succession of salty and sweet delicate food serving. It was not our first visit but the experience is always nice. Service is really professional and rather friendly, even if u are used to this kind of places the stage will make u feel really great. ","5","2016-03"
"Here for the Picture Taking","Hotel is vivid, picturesque, an opportunity to take hundreds if not thousands of photos.  Room is pompous and grandiose and should not disappoint.  Service is clinical but nothing to complain off.  High tea is standard affair and nothing to rave abut.  Breakfast at Jansui restaurant is average.  Dinner at Skyview Bar is very good, perhaps the best steak I have had in Dubai.  Complimentary spa provided under the FHR programme was rejuvenating. 

Choose a panoramic suite which is just a few hundred USD more than a standard suite.  Suite 121411 stayed arguably provide the best view among suites of similar category

All in all, Burj Al Arab is a must try once in a lifetime for its unique picture taking opportunity.  For longer stay > 3 days however, there are many hotels in Dubai that may cater to one's needs at half the price with none of the overcrowding feel plus without needing the inner confidence to project to the numerous butlers, guards, bellboys you belong in the hotel amid the billionaires Arabs and trillionaire venture capitalists.    

Lastly, the butler stuffed up and charged another guest's bill for the whole stay to my AMEX.  Whilst seemingly an easy issue to rectify, it took numerous e-mails and about six weeks to rectify, event that is incongruet to the ""ultimate hospitality Burj Al Arab is renowned for.""","4","2016-01"
"Luxurious and spacious","One word to describe the hotel: luxury! As we checked in, we were offered some wet towels and snacks. The staff is helpful and very professional. The suites are spacious and clean. The dining experience was perfect as the hotel offers various cuisines in 4 of its restaurants. The only thing I was disappointed with was the outer pool which is small and the outer walls were not painted well. To sum up, the prices are high, but not too high for the perfect expeeience! ","4","2016-03"
"Love the beach","It is a perfect walk on a perfect day. It was sunny. Lots of people and very friendly too from all over the world. You will see camels and can even take a camel ride. Get your swim on. Don't just take a picture it is very safe to deep in the water. Visited the hotel just for the pool and it was great.","5","2016-03"
"Self-proclaimed 7 star hotel","We stayed 1 night at Burj Al Arab for our vacation just to experience what 7 star hotel is like. We was expecting something better than what I usually get in Ritz, Park Hyatt or St. Regis. I checked-out next morning disappointed.

Pros - The hotel provides buggy shuttle service between the hotel and the beach. 
Cons - The lobby was very small and it was way too overcrowded. Most Asian tourists occupied the bottom floors of the hotel and the breakfast buffet at Junsui. To get a peace of mind - have your breakfast at Bab Al Yam. Poor quality of bathroom tissue - they were like sand papers. The tap water had residuals in it.","2","2015-05"
"Extravagant!","Stayed 2 nights with my wife.  Room was spacious and and clean.  The view was top notch.  We highly recommend high tea.  Very fun as a couple and the views from the top were crazy.  Can not wait to go back.","5","2015-04"
"What a wonderful High Tea","This is an amazing hotel and a great way to see it is by participating in High Tea in the Sky Room. Upon being seated you are served champagne and the menu is explained. There is an abundance of courses served (I am a non-meat water and was aptly catered for) and you certainly don't leave feeling hungry. The view from the Sky Lounge over the city of Dubai is breathtaking. There was no rush to escort us off the premises, we were given the opportunity to wander around taking photos before departing at our leisure. A wonderful few hours spent.","5","2016-03"
"Just amazing","We visited the hotel this January and the hotel is simply amazing. Even before you arrive, they anticipate your needs and make all arrangements. When you enter the lobby and see the atrium, it is in fact overwhelming. The staff was very helpful, discreet and always on hand. I loved the spa which had a lovely harman/pool and relaxation area which you could spend moments after a great massage. The top floor bar had spectacular views of Dubai and the major building could be seen, including the Palm, Jumeirah beach hotels and also Burj Khalifa. Overall, I would rate this hotel 11 out of 10, for service, decor, luxury and attention to details. The prices are high, but you don't come here to save money.","5","2016-01"
"ARRIVED EXCITED, LEFT DISAPPOINTED!!!!!","For a 7 star hotel, i was disappointed in the room being defective, my Nephews came to visit and the television was not working, a technician had to be called out to fix the problem which took longer than expected leaving my nephews unhappy. 

The shower was not working as it should and a another person had to be called out to fix, he told us the shower head was not working and had to be replaced which was done during the time i had guests over. The engineer told us the room was 'DEFECTIVE' and the shower head could not be fixed. Only when i went downstairs to complain was i given another room exactly the same. The Manager i spoke to did not make an effort to come to my room to apologise personally, my guests were shocked at how bad this '7 star Hotel' was. I was expecting at least an upgrade to a better room for the stress we had experienced. i changed rooms after midnight, the person who helped us changed rooms had been working there for 14 years and even he was shocked at how badly we were treated, he told us he would speak to another manager the next day. Maria the Duty Manager came to speak to us the next day and offered to change our rooms to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom and also took us to a tour which was promised when we checked in but never given. She was the only person that seemed at least a little ineterested in making up for the problems we had. However by that time it was too late as we were checking out the next day. 

For a 7 star hotel this was very disappointing, we had an amazing experience in Dubai before we checked into the Burj, we had travelled along with 100 people from the UK and had got married at the Le Royal Meridian Hotel where the service was amazing throughout, in hindsight we should of stayed there rather than going to the Burj. Nonetheless we were left disappointed with our stay and will be making a formal complaint as well as posting our reveiw on other websites. 

Other Issues we experienced included long waits to get a buggy to and from the beach, chips ordered from room service were clearly refried and not as fresh as we have had in other hotels. For a hotel which prides itself on providing a superior service to other hotels the Burj Al Arab feels very much inferior in this instance. Everyone at the hotel needs to have a long hard look at itself and realise that times have moved forward and in order to claim to be the best you have to ensure even the smallest things are taken care of for its guests. Hopefully this is just a one off, the management have been in touch and apologised, using the fact it was Chinese New year and they had a packed hotel thus we were overlooked. Appualling excuse for a hotel that claims to be the best!","2","2016-02"
"Luxurious experience ","Got a chance for show around in here..no doubt this is really a 7 star hotel with an awesome ambiance,the staff were so friendly and professional,the fountain in the lobby takes all the attraction and even the decorations with gold structures,located with the best view and all rounder it's a big wow.....","5","2016-03"
"Iconic","this is one the most expensive and luxurious hotels in the world. the design itself is one in the world. appears like a sailing boat with sails unfurled. there are high-end restaurants around on the waterfront and all cuisines can be enjoyed at their very best. aesthetics and engineering has created marvel. can be spotted as you descend from the skies.","5","2016-03"
"Afternoon tea","On arrival at the hotel we were warmly greeted by staff . The journey to 27th floor to skybar was indeed an experience parading through the hotel which is sumptuous beyond belief the staff were attentive without being overpowering and instantly knew our name and addressed us thou out the tea which was beautiful in fantastic surroundings with great views .an experience not to be missed .","5","2016-03"
"Burj Al Arab - Truly, the World’s Most Luxurious Hotel!","It is everyone’s dream to stay at the Burj Al Arab, the World’s Most Luxurious Hotel. And finally, a dream came true! I stayed here last February 7th with my elder sister and my twin sister to celebrate our Birthday and it was an amazing, luxurious, fabulous and a magical experience! Upon arrival, we were welcomed by the 2 Valet staff and a Doorman. And what’s so surprising was Jelena who recognised me as Mr. Aquino even it was only my first time to stay at BAA. I was very impressed coz almost everyone knew my name. I have been to Four Seasons, St. Regis, Waldorf Astoria and Rosewood but so far, Burj Al Arab has impressed me sooooo much! 
At the entrance, we were warmly welcomed by three staff, one serving a welcome drink, one serving towel, and one serving dates. Jelena was so friendly and professional with her personalised way of check in! And then, we were given a very elegant suite on the 1904. With our first Butler Ahmed waiting for us with another special welcome drink who was very helpful throughout our stay! And With our second Butler - the very super bubbly, friendly and professional Butler, Sajan! Just simply Amazing! Then, luggage came immediately! I am impressed with the Bellman! 
We had a dinner at the Al Mahara restaurant and even the price is very expensive, it’s all worth it! The best food, service, ambiance and view! Special thanks to Benjamin, and Lotis who spoiled us with their impeccable service! Special mention to Mircea and Aziz for looking after us as well. Iris from Private Dining and Butler Cheryl were very personalised and helpful and made sure we were enjoying our stay. We were so lucky that we were given a late check out till 6PM by the Guest Service Manager, Mazen so we can spend more time at the hotel and enjoy all the facilities.
Upon our departure, we were offered assistance by five Bellman namely Nawaz, Mohammed, Ali, Aneesh and Tony who were very helpful, friendly and made us feel like we are in our own home and made me realized that we need to come back and that is why I am coming back this April 1st to celebrate again my post Birthday celebration at the Burj Al Arab - the World’s Most Luxurious Hotel!
I am a big fan of luxury hotels but so far, this is my top favourite and will definitely come back again and again!","5","2016-02"
"Afternoon tea at the Skyview bar Excellent","Everything about this hotel lives up to its 7 star rating. I booked afternoon tea at the Skybar and requested a window table. Even if you cannot get a window table the panoramic views are pretty good from the inner tables. I would recommend asking for two outward facing seats which are available in some sections otherwise one person is facing inwards toward the bar. My wife and I had requested the 7 course high tea with champagne at ADH620 pp which was excellent. We had an additional glass of Dom Perignon each which again was delicious however the Louis Roderer we had earlier was almost as good to my palate. Service is excellent and not at all stuffy. The tea was excellent and I can recommend the White ""Peony""tea, very light and refreshing. Most people ( at least the ladies ) made an effort which helps the sense of occasion. Was it the best afternoon tea we have enjoyed, well I would not look to compare, just nice to enjoy a very good high tea in an iconic hotel with fabulous service. If you are in town and high tea is your thing and you want to try something special, don't miss this treat.","5","2016-03"
"Excellent ","This is the best hotel I ever stayed, it's on Jumeirah, Dubai's most expensive area on the sea. Lots of restaurants to choose from this hotel, impressive welcome by the staff and hospitality is more than impressive. If you book this hotel you can get free airport transfers by Rolls Royce... Luxury at it's feet. ","5","2016-01"
"Relaxing","My stay at the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah was quite pleasant and the views from the Sky Bar was just absolutely stunning. I had an amazing time at this place....unless your scared of heights, but who cares. It's worth it!","4","2016-03"
"Just absolutely perfect ! ","This hotel is my favorite in the world, not only because I find the design totally gorgeous but because you get the most impeccable service. The rooms are massive, lots of complementary goodies ( beach bag, wine, chocolate, full range of Hermès body products for him and her, etcetc), you have your own butler and the staff is just the best. Smiling, friendly, attentive,everything is easy, possible, you feel so welcome and so definitely spoiled ! Everything is in the details, like your own cooler box near your pool transat filled with water and cold towels, every hour they also bring you some more complementary food, water melon, ice cream, pop corn....we have been lucky to stay in the Burj 4 times and each of our stays has been a bliss. We just cannot wait to treat ourself to another dreamy week end in such an amazing place with the most perfect staff.","5","2016-03"
"Iconic building - Iconic service. ","I stayed in this hotel just for 2 nights. This has been one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Service is second to none. Privacy, butler, room quality - everything was amazing. The food was fine but you pay lot of money for decent food.

I would definitely come back to stay here again. I had thought that this hotel has lost out to Burj Khalifa - but no, this place has its own identity. ","5","2016-03"
"Stunning hotel","You can only pass the gatehouse to the hotel if you have made a reservation. My 21 year old daughter and I had High Tea at this luxury 7 star hotel (reviewed separately). You don't get to see much of the hotel but what you do see is stunning. The outside of the hotel lights up and changes colour, what we hadn't realised was the inside changed colour too. First floor atrium is stunning, you look straight up to the very top of the building.  It has about 6 jewellers. None of them showed prices 'if you have to ask you can't afford' is my motto so we just looked through the window! I would recomend making some kind of reservation and seeing it for yourself","5","2016-03"
"High Tea in high tower , high expectations exceeded","Having read many reviews and knowing the hotel's reputation I was expecting our high tea in the Sky Bar to be great and I can report that it exceeded my high expectations and was actually good value in consideration of what we had.  My greatest surprise was I thought there was a 2 hour time limit but we were meeting up with a friend who lives in Dubai so 3 girls together easily chatted away 5 hours and not once did we feel pressured to leave.  The service is exemplary, the atmosphere relaxed at 430 sitting with harpist but turned to a gentle buzz when we finally departed at 930pm.  We also had the day and nighttime views, which although marred by the overcast weather were still very impressive.  The food and drinks were beautifully presented, described at each course, alternatives offered to meet any dietary requirements.  This included my dislike of coconut, I was advised which pastry contained coconut and offered an alternative.  We left fully satisfied on all levels and with a couple of cake boxes as we had not managed to eat all that was offered.","5","2016-03"
"mesmerizing!!!","fantastic hotel had dinner in the marhaba restaurant next to the biggest fish tank in the world amazing great food and staff . had pre dinner drinks in retro bar 24th floor amazing views of Dubai and heli pad opulent at its very best this is crossed of my bucket list great experience !!!","5","2015-04"
"Amazing Afternoon Tea in Sky Bar","A wonderful experience, spectacular views from the Sky Bar.  Champagne and dates to start, followed by 5 courses - lovely attentive staff, explaining each course.  Wide menu choice of teas or if you prefer, coffees and fresh juices.","5","2016-03"
"Afternoon High Tea in the Sky Bar","Just got in from a fantastic afternoon tea at the hotel fantastic hotel and staff we will not need to eat tonight after today tea we had over two hours at the hotel the views from the sky bar are great even on a overcast to like today I'd love to go back next time we are in the city","5","2016-03"
"Excellent Valentine's dinner","Though do not come from a family background where Valentine's day is celebrated but walking into Burj Al Arab to celebrate Valentine's eve still lingering in my mind. Visited a couple of years ago but its fresh in mind the ambiance, the furore. Would love to reeat again.","5","2016-02"
"it's views and inside service is perfect excellence nothing but the best","People told us it's boring but what we did and where we went no one else we know did we made each day interesting, babal shams resort Burj kalifa the dancing water falls the souks the malls the Atlantis hotel aqarium the views from our hotel, the food every thing is the best in the world.","5","2015-04"
"It Is Everything You Could Dream... and More","We stayed at the Burj al Arab for 2 nights in February 2016.  This was our honeymoon trip and also our first visit to Dubai.  We stayed in Panoramic View suite 712. The panoramic view suites are located at the ends of the hallways and as such have a dazzling view of the Arabian Gulf.  We received a warm welcome, with dates and Arabian coffee and then our hostess showed us to our suite for checkin.  The suite was perfection!  It had a first floor living area, with bar, dining area, desk with Mac, and a powder room.  Upstairs was the bedroom, a sitting area and the amazing master bath.  

Everything during our stay at the Burj was perfection.  The staff and butlers were kind and wonderful and anticipated every need.  On our 1st night there, the staff surprised us with a honeymoon chocolate cake, card, and roses!  During our stay, we enjoyed just touring the hotel and taking it all in, and spent an entire day on the Burj’s private beach.  There are buggies to take you down to the beach area, and our driver gave us a tour of the Jumeirah beach area as well.  We ended each day with a long soak in the Jacuzzi tub. Our room package included a buffet breakfast.  There was a choice of having this at the Junsui restaurant or at the Bab al Yam restaurant.  We chose the poolside Bab al Yam for both days and it was a wonderful buffet with excellent service. 

The bed was amazingly comfortable and we slept so well while we were there.  There was even a pillow menu which we sadly forgot to try out.  The bathrooms are supplied with Hermes toiletries and cologne.  

This visit was total relaxation and fun.  We will definitely make the Burj al Arab a part of our future visits to Dubai.","5","2016-02"
"A Unique Breakfast","This is one of the best places to visit and  unique experience. Their Omelette and food quality is out of this world. Highly recommended and certainly not to be missed. Awesome service as well. 
Reaching early makes the whole difference with superb views and chilled atmosphere. 
I would also consider their coffee with cookies, as both are of amazing taste and very high quality.","5","2016-03"
"The best one - must visit!!","The best one i have ever visited whether it be in terms of luxury, services, ambience or whatever... if you have money and you gotta get a chance to be in dubai ever, don't miss burj al arab.. loved it..","5","2015-08"
"you must  go","if you have  money to go for it 
they   welcome you upon arrival, and a   very  respectful person will take you to do the  check in and bring you inside 
they all dress in blue 
royston the  concierge very nice, he has   gold  keys of the concierge association  like   julian from  emirates palace in abu dhabi 
the girl  from dubai, very young also helps  you 
nina  from marketing    very nice 
the hotel have many restaurants,  of course AL MAHARA is the  best 
language is not a problem, they  all speak  many languages, 
it is called the 7 star hotel 
there  are not 7 stars  but they service is the difference","5","2016-03"
"Happy burjday","After a dreadful 3 day stay at another hotel we decided to upgrade and left early to stay at the burj
We were greeted with old fashioned courtesy which is never lacking at any jumerhai
After a 10 min wait in the lobby we were checked in in the room and shown round by our butler
He informed us that if we would like a bath drawn to just inform him of the time 😊 he also gave us the pillow and matress menu 
We then explored both the private beach and the pool 
The pool at the moment has some construction however this was entertaining as my partner wanted a hard hat to show them how to do it correctly lol
Only thing we missed out on was drinks and snacks at happy hour in our suite as we were never offered it despite being in the room so a tad gutted about that
After dinner we processed to the sky lounge which is an experience despite the bar prices but can't be missed as you have a full view over dubai at night which is stunning
Breakfast was stunning. I requested savoury French toast which was not a problem to the chef who was just so kind
The selection was amazing
Check out was simple and again done in your room by your butler and not waiting at reception
What was also very nice was his and her matching hermes full size toiletries however we hunted but couldn't find a sewing kit to 'aquire' 
At no time did I worry about carrying our bags as the magically appeared and disappeared (even the butler asked did we want them unpacked and packed by them)
While waiting for our car to the airport the head concierge gave us the guided tour of the hotel cars to which he was as much a petrol head as we were
From start to finish it certainly was a happy burjday 

","5","2016-03"
"Best restaurant and services","My friend and I went to the Junshi buffet of Burj Al Arab on March 3, when we went there so earlier so that we stayed outside to take some pictures for a while until the restaurant opens at 6:00 PM. During our dinner, the waiter Vikram served us nicely and politely so that we were joyful and cared. The price is reasonable not too expensive. So I recommend the restaurant if anyone wants to go to Burj AI Arab for a dinner.","5","2016-03"
"Out standing","Can't describe the feeling when you are a guest in this hotel. Deserve the seven star for sure. You have your privet butler once your foot step in the hotel till you leave. The world ( NO ) is not in there dictionary, any requests will be done for you. 
Highly recommended","5",
"An icon","This place is the offspring of a colossal space ship and Buckingham Palace. We were blown away by the hotel's inconceivable architecture and the pure opulence of the room. There are other hotels in Dubai of course but nothing says Dubai quite as well as the Burj. We had to pinch ourselves as we were led into our room with its golden staircase, alabaster pillars and mosaic bathroom by our very own butler. I thought I glimpsed  King Midas in the corner. The mirror above the bed was a little off-putting at first, but not for long. The Burj is a real icon and we count ourselves very lucky to be able to stay there. The only criticism I have is the the decor of the rooms, whilst very well maintained, is now pretty dated. This does not detract from and overwhelmingly wonderful experience.","5","2016-03"
"Afternoon tea -world class","What a special place, we requested the sea and land table weeks in advance, we were fortunate enough to get this not down to the booking down to the fact we arrived 20minutes before our reservation , you need to clear security before you drive up, ensure you have a paper print out on your booking , beautiful location , lift to the top floor taken in small groups, waiting staff are superb , tattinger offered with afternoon tea, food quality stunning with more sandwiches offered , best to book at 4pm then you can stay for sunset which is magical, stunning views of the city , great views of the Atlantis Palm, burj Kalifa and jumierah beach hotel, expensive but worth every cent ! I look forward to returning . Incredible staff !","5","2016-02"

"Tips to a dream come true","When you set up for a dream and live it up, it is magnificent. 
Tip #1: If you decide to stay at Burj Al Arab, you must arrive with the unmistakably white Rolls Royce Phantom! Looking out the window from the plush custom made cushion, while driving over the 200m long bridge makes you feel like a modern day Jackie O. 
As soon as the car pulls up at the porte-cochère a beautiful ""siren"" (yes, they could all be models and they wear their uniforms like some, too!) whisks you through the busy hotel lobby and up to your suite. 
Tip #2: Even though it feels like walking through a dream, due to all day visitors who come to the restaurants and the multitude of interior design details, follow the ""siren"" like a beaming light. In most cases, you will experience the traditional Arabian welcome. She will offer you rose water to perfume your hands, clod towels to refresh, then dates and qahwa (the Arabic coffee). It is polite to accept the offerings, then follow the lady to your designated floor, while she explains to you how to navigate the hotel. 
Tip #3: Never worry about your luggage. They will be securely transferred through almost a military operation. 
Arrived at your suite, you will meet your butler, who will great you with more welcome drinks. As soon as we got acquainted with the space and finished the check in process, we communicated our requests to the butler (i.e.: certain glasses, iron/ironing board, cutlery, towels, etc.). Then we got ready for the exclusive beach.
Tip #4: To commute from the hotel to the exclusive beach dedicated to Burj Al Arab guests (until the new island extension will be built), use the exclusive white buggies - they are the best of their class. They cost as much as a small car, and aside from this instance they can also be found at Taj Mahal or other royal grounds.
We returned from the beach to try the pool at Bab Al Yam and to catch the moment when the sun sets over the Palm, then went back to the suite to get ready for dinner.
Tip #5: The magnificent bathroom has a few details to notice: All guests amenities are branded Hermes. On top of the bathtub there is a mural which depicts at least one representative element from each of the seven emirates. Amongst them there is Jumeriah Beach Hotel - the first Jumeriah hotel. The next one built within the group was Burj Al Arab, which at the time, really placed Dubai on the World's map and later brought its present fame. The shower can be set at your preferred temperature so that every time it's switched on, the heat will always be constant.
Tip #6: No matter when is dinner booked, expect some visits from your butler between 5-8pm - this is the time when evening amenities (usually snacks) and happy hour cocktails are served.
Tip #7: Louis Roederer is the house champagne. Make sure you order it. I can not think of a moment throughout the day when it would actually feel inappropriate to have it while you reside at Burj Al Arab... or in those magnificent $20k beds with a mirror on top.
Come down to the lobby in the evening. It has a totally different atmosphere, lighting, live music...
Tip #8: Dinner is always a special event - Dress up. Depending on the event or how many people will join for dinner, you can choose between Al Mahara, Al Muntaha, Junsui, Al Iwan. We ate in all these restaurants before, but chose Junsui on this occasion because we were joined by a rather large group, and also because of the comfort food and the amazing creations the chefs prepare for us every time we go back.
Tip #9: Trust your somelier. Their cellar is mind blowing. 
Tip #10: For any requests or inquiries out of the premisses of the hotel ask to be connected to the Concierge.","5","2015-04"
"Work of fantastic engineering. Rich, but ugly decoration","The site is surrounded by glamor and excess marketing. Inside it prevails the use of materials with enough gold, however a Chinese decor, I do not like. I do not consider interesting for a long hosting due to its high cost, but if you have some money left, worth the visit.","4","2015-12"
"Must see","This hotel you must see, when you visit Dubai. Even to enter inside as a visitor. The price for the visitor is acceptable. The food and drinks in the outlets are out of any comments. Very professional and prefessional staff","5","2015-08"
"Truly Amazing","This hotel is truly amazing.We always book directly through the hotel with help from Nimal Joseph in reservations.Pick a dream package which includes airport pick up breakfast and evening meal for best value among other  benefits.
From the moment you are picked up at the airport you have nothing to worry about as everything is done for you. Every single member of staff is friendly ,always smiling and will go out of their way to help you.They are down to earth and NOT pompous or arrogant.I feel people get the wrong impression of this hotel at times.Airport pick up was by the new BMW 7 series which was amazing.All the ladies in our group were each presented with a bouquet of roses.The staff are waiting on your arrival and check in is in the suite ,all the rooms in this hotel are duplex suites.They are amazing ,elegant with gold leaf everywhere.The bed is the most comfortable we have every slept in,all types of pillows including memory foam are available.Anything requested is delivered in minutes.There are Hermes products in the bathroom . Canapes and cocktails are delivered to your room about 6pm and a Thomas the tank engine loaded with chocolates and all types of sweets for the children is available,just ask the butler and it will call to your room .Actually if you have no children  you can still ask for it!!
Breakfast was taken in Bab Al Yam which has recently been renovated.
Head chef Mohit Bhargava has done an amazing job ,breakfast is amazing and a completely new evening menu has been designed.
Every single item of food in this restaurant is of the highest quality be it the strawberry s or mango to the steak or breads.If they haven,t got something ,ask and it usually appears the next morning.I asked for black pudding and  Shamoun the chef with the little hat !! sourced it from Kenya as this was the best available.
Our girls love chocolate doughnuts ,Each morning when we arrived for breakfast there were 4 waiting on a plate.I love mango and there was always mango beautifully sliced on the table waiting for me.
Evening meal in Bab Al Yam or Junsui the asian restaurant is as always exquisite The chefs and serving staff in both restaurants are exemplary.
After eating go down to the Lobby and listen to the classical musicians playing live,they are superb and their rendition of 7 seconds is breath taking. 
This hotel is very special. Our best holiday memories are always from Burj.
It really is the best hotel in the world.","5","2016-02"
"Amazing Hotel!","We stayed at the Burj for 7 nights recently. The place is amazing. Spectacular location, phenomenal hotel, the suites are incredibly designed and finished out and they are gigantic. Two butlers 24 hours a day stationed at the entrance of each floor. Only 6 suites on our floor. The butlers were amazing. Truly, the entire staff were over the top polite and incredible  service with a smile. I am quite particular about getting tremendous service when you are staying at a top flight hotel and the Burj delivered and then some. The doormen were awesome and always remembered our names (as did most everyone truly). One doorman in particular stood out. His name is Hardley. This man is one of the nicest, friendliest, happiest men I have ever met. He went way above and beyond for us. Well done Hardley!! I could go on and on about the people that work at the Burj. They all are the best. I never encountered one person with anything less than an attitude of ""I will do anything possible to make your stay perfect."" I only have one small constructive comment. There were times when I felt like the security guys at the gates coming onto the property did not actually check to make sure we were who we said we were. I know there is a trade off between security and not making people wait, but I believe the security could be tighter. In all the Burj is as advertised. The best of the best!!","5","2016-02"
"Spa package - grandeur and warmth, they have got it just right!","I spent a day in the Burj as a part of the spa package. Priced at 146 pounds, it was worth far more. 
You get to spend all day in the spa, get a spa treatment( and these are to die for), plus get a three course afternoon tea, coupled with beach access. If you want to use the gym with sea view then that's available as well..
First a description of the spa. Magnificently done up with high roofs, a multi-coloured décor which flows harmoniously, a pool and a Jacuzzi, floor to ceiling windows with spectacular views and luxury bath products.
Scattered here and there are these ""test tubes"" of juices , really yummy, carrot and beetroot...
I really liked the way they have chosen the staff. Not your slightly scary hi-fi posh girls.
Here they come from all parts of the world - Philippines, Nepal, South Africa..
They are warm and kind and treat you like an old friend. 
I had come directly off the flight from London. They went out of their way to make sure that I was rested and relaxed before I went for my massage.
And the massage from Bianca - what can I say! Simple superb. And I am very particular about spa treatments.
You get a tea included in the package. The food was so good. Scones, sandwiches, samosas, pastries, juice and the best coffee I have ever had complete with gold leaf!
Again it was the kindness of the lady who served me as I sat by myself in the magnificent room - gently persuading to have just a little more...... No dinner was required that day!
It was then time to visit the Burj beach. A buggy takes you over, they make up a lovely cabana for you and give you a full box of ice cold water and cold towels. Very nice...
Overall I think the Burj spa package was fantastic value for money.
Total pampering, great food, and a nice jaunt to the beach.
I found it interesting - they way they have combined luxurious décor with fantastic service. This kind of hospitality is hard to come by in a hotel of this calibre.
Would I go again? In a heartbeat!
A must - do pampering experience.","5","2015-08"
"Culinary Flight 10/02/2016","Having read various reviews about the Culinary Flight and the cost involved I went ahead and booked this experience, and so glad I did. From the arrival by a black Rolls Royce Ghost to the time I left was a truly wonderful experience. I decided on the lunch setting purely because I don't like eating late in the evening. The staff were very polite and friendly and the food was wonderful. The only restaurant that was a little hectic was the Asian restaurant this was nothing to do with the Burj Al Arab it was purely a lot of highly excited Chinese people celebrating their New Year, which is nothing different from what people do all over the world. On leaving I enquired about hiring one of the hotels BMW's the friendly receptionist rang through my request she told me it would be about 10 minutes which I didn't mind as it allowed me to continue my experience a little bit longer.
If you are thinking about booking a Culinary Flight all I can say is stop thinking and do it.  Thank you Burj Al Arab for a great experience.","5","2016-02"
"Extravagant afternoon tea","Booked myself and family to go to an afternoon tea here last week. The initial drive up to the hotel was quite spectacular and upon arrival you are greeted by staff who help you out of your vehicle and park it if required. Once into the hotel you are struck but my the opulence of the hotel, however at this point it was not obvious where we needed to go, so I asked the helpful reception desk for directions and was directed upstairs to the sky view bar reception, from which our afternoon tea journey began.
After taking a private elevator up to the 27th floor, we were greeted once again by another reception and then taken to our table which felt special and had a fab view out towards the sea and palm area of Dubai. The service was excellent and we had an allocated waiter whom stayed with us through the experience. Food wise we had an apple and white chololate starter which was very nice, followed by a small pastry pie with vegetables and cheese, also very tasty. This part of the meal was accompanied by a glass of champagne. We then moved onto the traditional afternoon tea items which started with a selection of sandwiches which had various flavoured breads accompanying the fillings. Unfortunately I didn't think the sandwiches were anything special and perhaps lacked the taste impact I'd expected from this course. Nonetheless we were offered extras if required and this then followed with warn scones and cakes which were all very tasty but by this point we all felt a little full to fully enjoy all the cakes! The second part of the experience came with unlimited tea, coffee or iced drinks. We had specific dietary requirement such as a nut allergy and request for decaf drinks which the restaurant and waiter dealt with without hesitation which was lovely.
It's an expensive afternoon tea, however I would recommend it to those wanting to mark a special occasion in Dubai....just make sure you are hungry!","4","2016-02"
"Afternoon tea","Booked this by email with ease, it was a very luxurious hotel with lots of very attentive staff. We had a lovely table in the window looking out toward the jumeirah beach hotel. The afternoon tea was delicious, starting with champagne, then a further seven courses, including sandwiches, savoury tart, scones with home made jam selections and clotted cream, sweet pastries, sorbet, and cakes. We were not hurried and were frequently offered more tea, coffee and other drinks. We had a great service and as we were celebrating an anniversary we were also served an anniversary cake and roses which was a lovely touch. Definitely worth every penny, a wonderful experience.","5","2016-02"
"Absolutely amazing","Decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal whilst in dubia, this place was amazing the food was the best Iv ever had, staff where so friendly, the place is stunning and so where the views, highly recommend and would definitely go back again!","5","2015-11"
"An evening in Paradise","We are just back from a 11 day visit to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. We had the pleasure of
staying at the Marriott Marquis, Emirates Palace, and the Palm Atlantis.  All were to die for but the highlight of the trip was a dinner at the Burj Al Arab. We ate at the Junsui restaurant which was a buffet beyond words. This hotel can not be done justice via pictures or description. What I want to share is the incredible service and attention given to your every need  We were made to feel like a King and Queen despite not staying at the hotel. The Junsui manager Kok Wen Gio after our meal gave us a personal tour of the hotel. Mr Gio could not be more warm and engaging. Our waiter Chardana from Sri Lanka was most professional and attentive as well. Mind you we were just diners at his restaurant. We were made to feel like part of a family of satisfied quests. Amazing!! In the future this will be the only hotel we will stay at.  Having seen all the highlights of Dubai we will not step foot off the Burj Al Arab grounds. This hotel is beyond a 7 star
hotel.   Dr Rose and Dr Charles Estelle","5","2016-02"
"Loved every minute of my stay.","The Burj is by far the best hotel i have ever stayed in, Ok it is very over the top and ostentatious but that is part of the charm of the place. Every member of staff from the doorman to the manager was very friendly and helpful. The suite we stayed in had everything you could possibly need, including a mini office complete with Apple Mac computer and printer.I could have easily lived there forever. The Butler/Consierge on our floor was a really lovely man and deserves a special mention, nothing was too much trouble for him. My daughter lost her purse at the previous hotel but he tracked it down, collected it and retuned it to my daughter all in a couple of hours, amazing service.
We had the buffet breakfast which was very good with a huge variety of food on offer.
We also booked the white Rolls Royce to transfer us to the airport as a final treat. 
We cannot wait to return to the Burj and would like to thank everyone for an amazing stay.","5","2016-02"
"it doesn't live up to its reputation","(1) Check-in & reception:
We stayed for 2 days for our honeymoon vacation. The first day when we check in was very early in the morning, but the booking agent seems didn't update our new reservation for a winter dream package(have luch or dinner at Al Iwan or Junsui), so the first butler who contacted us only provided us with room and very very simple, short and roughly introduction, even didn't mentioned about the facilities and rights we deserved(all of the informations were googled online and confirmed with the other butler) . When we confirmed our booking with the first butler, he told us that his was time to get off work and he didn't have the right to ckeck and change our booking. Then the next butler in that morning asked us to wait for the call from the booking agent at around 10 a.m, he would call back to confirm it. But we wait for 4-5 hours and no one contacted us, we lost our patience until 12:05 p.m. and the butler told us that they finally confirmed our booking. 
(2) Food:
We had our first arabic styled lunch at Al Iwan(it cost AED495each person if wa didn't bought the package), the salad was ok, but the meat (beef and lamb) were total disaster!!! The meat were overcooked and dry. The restaurant didn't provided any water or drinks, after-meal tea or coffee, you had to paid at least extra AED 40 to have a bottle of still water. The next day, the breakfast at oudoor pooling restaurant was quite nice, food is good and nice view. We had dinner at Junsui, the adia flavored restaurant, it provied us with lots of choice, but almost every dish was really salty. Luckily it provied us with glass of free water! Thanks God!! 
In all, the food here were very disappointed, it didn't provided with such  high-level food compared to its price and reputation.
(3) Facilities: 
All the facilities the hotel provided were gorgeous and stunning, the Talise spa & fitness center, Jumeirah beach and access to the Jumeirah resort, free and convenient gulf cars between hotels and beach. The beach was quiet and with beautiful views. The beach was our favorite part of Burj al arab. 
(4) Others: 
The hotel prepared honeymoon surprise(a cake and roses). It was great and sweet.
(5) Charges: 
As i mentioned above, the first butler only made brief introduction. He told us the the drinks in the refrigerator wasn't free, but didn't mentioned about the chips , cookies and nuts. We thought that the hotel gave a box of sweet for free, so did those snacks (they are in the same box), while waiting for the booking confirmed, we opened the chips and nuts(we thought it was free as the box of sweet). On the day we are leaving, it charged a lot of money on the bill. During accomodation, no one confirmed it  with us until we payed the bill. 
(6) It provied us with unfirgetavle memories but no next time, because it cost too much with such service and you need more attention during the accomadation if you will pay more or not.","3","2016-02"
"Very Special","Went here with friends for afternoon tea - from the moment you arrive your treated as if your someone special, their attention to detail is second to none.  We had a window seat with a panoramic view, one side 'the world' the other side 'the palm'  Our waiter took care of us so well, we chose the champagne afternoon tea, each course was explained to us in detail what it was & at the end we could not finish everything.  Price is not cheap, for champagne afternoon tea for 3 people & 2 bottles of their signature (house) white wine cost = £600 but worth every penny","5","2016-01"
"Couple","Its a luxurious hotel yes,but it is like been interior design by a child who loves glitter and colours. It might be one of the iconic building of dubai but it so superficial and naff and over rated and over priced.  You can try there sky high tea just for the experience but really its the same as any other afternoon high tea except maybe for the view and knowing you are in one of the priciest place in dubai.","3","2016-01"
"A Great Experience","Visited the Burj Al Arab during a Dubai stop over and went for As they describe it Ultimate High Tea.   It was a fantastic experience and the food and service was as would be expected of the highest standard.  We enjoyed the fact that we could have a good look around the public areas of the Hotel before we ate.   The service was at a leisurely pace and not at all rushed.  The whole tea took nearly two and a half hours, and after settling the bill we were given souvenir chocolates and after shave and perfume.   Whilst it is very unlikely we will visit again due to its location, I would recommend this experience to anyone passing through Dubai.","5","2016-02"
"7 Star No .. 3 Star Yes","One word of warning do not go here during Chinese New Year!!!

For the price this hotel carries, it is for sure not a 7 Star. 

All of the employees are either Filipino or Indian.

The hotel was completely full with Chinese Coach Tours.  When we tried to check out there were mainland Chinese in front of us and they took over one hour to check out from the (so called private) concierge.  Then our bags where taken down from the room and they took 45 minutes to make it to the loading ramp.  There was so many mainland Chinese Coaches backed up trying to get into the hotel it took 3 hours to check out from start to finish.

On top of this the shops in the hotel are very snobby and very rude.  They have no class.","2","2016-02"
"""View of Burj Al Arab From Public Beach""","Fantastic view of Burj Al Arab from the Beach. Wow what an experience to see a 7 star hotel Burj Al Arab. The nice time to see sun set at 5.45 pm. A lovely place, very clean beach and a must place to visit in Dubai. ","5","2016-02"
"A Photo Tour of the Burj Al Arab - Awesome does'nt do it Justice","The Burj Al Arab an enchanting thrilling architectural marvel is the quintessential icon of Dubai. instantly recognizable around the world. A must see; the first sight only spurs one on to see it again and again and more and more.
Marvelous and what opulence - designated the world's most luxurious hotel.","5","2016-02"
"One Off Lifetime experience","On a 6 day visit to Dubai, decided to book a room at the Burj for the last night of our stay. Despite the cost, it was an unforgettable experience, especially as we took in the Culinary Flight option.

The room was on the 16th floor and had the most amazing view of the coast and the Burj Khalifa. We were assigned 2 butlers who were there to meet our every need. After showing us round our room, we were left to explore the sheer opulence of the place. It was seriously over the top, but this was surely intentional. A gold framed TV, remote control curtains, a gold plated coffee machine, the shower had 12 different knobs and taps. The cashew nuts in the mini-bar were US$35….

20 minutes before our Culinary Flight was due to start, our butlers appeared with flowers, sandwiches and a large cake for our wedding anniversary. We weren't complaining, especially as our wedding anniversary is in January, not November. The Culinary Flight involved a course in each of the hotel's 6 restaurants. We took the option to have wine matching with our meal. Although this came to around £400 a head, it was a great way to see all parts of the hotel. Having a meal in any one of the restaurants would easily have cost over £100 a head anyway, so it seemed good value for money.

The 'flight' started at 7pm with a cocktail in the bar on the 27th floor. The view from here was astounding as we chose the food we'd consume over the next 5 hours. The whole experience ran like clockwork, with staff accompanying us between the restaurants where we were greeted by the respective managers. The main course was in the Al Mahara (Underwater Restaurant), which had a floor to ceiling aquarium. The fillet steak here was outstanding. The final course was dessert, served in the open area of the 1st floor. By this stage, we were more than full…..and then came more flowers and another anniversary cake!

The breakfast was also very spectacular, with cuisine to suit any one of the nationalities staying there. It really was impossible to fault any of the service, but you would expect this for the price…..","5","2015-11"
"A very high tea!","Posh in the extreme. Booked as a treat for special occasion as not cheap but worth every single penny. Beautiful sandwiches that kept coming and too many cakes to eat. Champagne and any tea or coffee you can think of. Service as you would expect faultless. Bench seats are a bit uncomfortable if you're short so ask for Window seats plus you get the best views. Entrance is a display of sheer opulence and the lift to the restaurant is hairaising at best!!!! All good fun!","4","2015-10"
"Not Only for the Looks","There are many times we already lodge at the Burj Al-Arab and time and time again it manages to keep not only for me but for everyone the standards and the level that shows in his impressive exteriors and luxurious interiors. Great rooms, great service.

It costs money, but quality cannot be questioned for a matter of some Euros here and there. Excellent over and over again. You shall com here for a personal treat, not only for the looks.","5","2015-11"
"A lovely experience of high tea","We had height tea in the sky bar and it was a truly magical. The ambiance of the sky bar was a amazing. We were allowed to walk around and take photos ( it was a little hazy). Upon arrival the staff are welcoming and explain how the 7 course of tea will be served. They will ask for your preference and will try and accommodate them. You can eat and drink as much as you like of the sandwiches and pastries. You can drink as much as like of tea, coffee etc. Rubén our waiter was fantastic and happily took photos for us. A lovely experience.","5","2016-02"
"Burj Al Arab","If you visit Dubai you'll probably want to visit the only 7 star hotel in the world (assuming you're not staying there!) Non-residents can only do this by making an advance reservation. Ask your hotel concierge to do this for you and he will provide you with your written reservation which must be presented to the security staff at Burj Al Arab. But he may not tell you that there is a dress code - gentlemen must wear long trousers. I arrived wearing shorts and after an argument with security staff was allowed in and met by one of the many lady staff (all immaculately dressed, polite and friendly) who actually provided me with a pair of trousers. I had afternoon tea in the Skyliner Bar at the top of the hotel. There are 8 courses and the cost is £120.00! The hotel is palatial.","5","2015-12"
"Birthday Treat","All the hype about this property is well and truly deserved, had 2nights , the second one with the grand children who are UAE residents and being under 12 stayed free. Our butler was marvellous providing complimentary goodies throughout , wine on both nights , roses, chocolate cake,cookies and dates to name just a few. While the service is outstanding the food is no better than any other 5 star hotel. Yes a lot off money to stay there but came away feeling that we got value for money, even tho paying £11 for a cup of coffee or a bottle of still water at lunch , hurt s a little , but this is Dubai . Like one reviewer said "" make sure to have luggage space for all the freebies"" ","5","2016-02"
"Average lunch buffet, was a bit too crowded.","Been here last week for the lunch buffet, the staff was quite cold and not very friendly, while most food is not very delicious with a few eastern dishes. Not worth $175. And it was crowded with tourist so dont feel like you're in a 5 star hotel.","2","2016-02"
"Very Good Hotel","This is very nice hotel with good security and very nice architecture.
They also provide very good restaurant which i have lunch the restaurant name is Junsui.  The staff very friendly and they also have tennis court at the top of the hotel.","5","2015-03"
"Must come back","We booked Burj to celebrate my 50th birthday. Truly amazing experience where ambience and views of the gulf just add to it. The staff went extra mile from providing the car for our son who left his passport at the hotel we stayed prior to Burj, to taking care of birthday cake, flowers, preparing my evening dress, rescheduling birthday meal to suit us etc. We found the staff to be helpful, but not over imposing. Small hick-up with the sound system in the room was resolved quickly and professionally. We felt more like being at home than at a hotel. Meal at Al Mahala was another highlight. To be really picky, if anything at all, I could not justify money I paid for my hair wash and blow dry as it was pretty ""average"" at the back wash, but again, ""compared to what"" (?)... One thing for sure: one day at Burj is not enough to appreciate it to the full as it's got so much to offer, so we'll be back.","5","2016-02"
"Gogo!","Expencive - yes. Worth it - yes. Best cocktails ever - yes. Best view ever - yes. Lovely experience - yes. Romantic experience - yes. 

We didn't spend the night here, but had a lovely afternoon/evening in the sky bar with view over Dubai. Our best night in Dubai. ","5","2015-05"
"Shades of blue","The best aspect of this architecture is its strategic view that overlooks the sea. It gives u mikes and mikes of sea on one side, while it also gives u the rest of Dubai. U can even see the famous Atlantis from here. It's a beautiful place to Listen to the ocean.","4","2016-02"
"Afternoon tea at Burj Al Arab 2nd February  2016","We made a reservation via email prior to our holiday and can honestly say this was a fantastic experience. The staff were very friendly and efficient and the food was amazing. We were made to feel very welcome and were not rushed to leave our table. In fact we stayed for 3 hours and watched the sun go down. We would recommend this to anyone.....experience of a lifetime ","5","2016-02"
"Save the pinnacle of Dubai and bring back the famous 7* rating","Checked in late night, we were a couple. Got a high rate for the duplex suite since it's a high season in Dubai hotels.

We graciously found the hostess waiting for us by the entrance of the hotel which offered to take us straight to the suite and do the check in there.

After finishing the check in formalities I ordered the butler to present us with what cocktails can be served now, a guy I think from room service came to our suite and looked into the menu which we already went through and he had this puzzled looked; I asked him so what cocktails can you offer us now?
 he said I don't know! And whilst his reading of the beverages menu he looked puzzled and actually didn't know or shall I say understand what his hotel offers or what was in the menu for drinks. After seeing the lost look on his face I decided to keep it safe and went with a bottle of wine.

As a law in dubai ever person who stays in a hotel in dubai should present a physical ID upon check in, I had mine but my friend didn't and to be fair the hotel offered to send a driver; with charge of course to where my friend has kept his passport with his friend and bring it to the hotel. That's that.

Now let's talk about the 7 stars and the hotel interior.

Been staying let's say once a year in Burj Alarab, this time I noticed the interior of the hotel is getting worn out and you can see the management is cutting on expenses by holding up on refurbishment.
You can see the upholstery color has darkened from over use and low maintainance. The carpet wasn't to the the cleanliness standard of the once famous Burj standards. The whole lower living room can be summed up in one description, it's like coming to a place a night after a heavy party was held in and then housekeeping tried to quick clean the place. That sort of vibe; can't use the word dirty but the condition wasn't worth the Burj 7 star rating

The biggest problem was the AC, as I love to sleep in a temperature of 20 and below, the room temp was 23 that's with doing the most in increasing the fan and reducing the temperature and after calling maintainance. Though the bead is heavinly but could not sleep.

The technology in the suite to sum it up is outdated by 10 years.
Not user friendly at all and you need to move out of bed to control the AC and the lights.

The hotel kindly gave us a late checkout till 4pm

I went to checkout by 2:45pm and it took the staff 40 minutes to finish the process!
Reason? I had 2 bottle of juices from the mini bar and the staff had a problem adding it to the bill and apparently there was a code they need to enter to the system and that code was with another employee which was out of reach for 35 minutes.

Regardless all of what I said above I believe Burj Al Arab is the true landmark of Dubai and it's normal for hotels to go through slumps but for now if they want to regain their 7 star status they need to invest in:

Professional employees with expertise from the best hotels in the world to work in the hotel. As the staff is somewhat rude and undereducated 

Refurbishment is a must. Interior refurbishment and technological.

And one last thing I noticed on checkout is the amount of tour buses which carried tourists not staying in the hotel to just go around the hotel exterior and outside in front of the lobby to take pictures and cause a mayhem in traffic and circulation.

I hope the management of jumiera group restore the image of their pinnacle property and bring back its exclusivity, as tour busses around the small round about carrying 100's of tourists wanting to take pictures give a cheap look.

Save the pinnacle of Dubai and bring back the famous 7* hotel.","3","2016-02"
"If in Dubai a must see","While we were not staying in this hotel, we booked a high tea for my birthday.  Wow what a 7 star hotel definitely 7 star.  I would have loved to view a room.  High tea was fantastic and the view from the dining room was absolutely fantastic.  Even going up in the lift was scenic.  If you get a chance to stay a night I would recommend as you can't just visit the hotel on your own, you have to book a high tea or a meal, security very tight.","5","2015-05"
"excellent but staff sometimes not excellent","Often visit burj al arab for lunch and diners. Excellent atmosphere but sometimes staff in not in 7 star level of hotel. Nearly became crazy when reception desk can not issue invoice to me. I can not understand how difficult is get one invoice in this hotel","5","2015-12"
"Well worth a visit","While we were not staying in this hotel we did want to go see it. We made reservations for breakfast and wow were we impressed. The waitstaff were very nice and breakfast was delicious. You are not allowed to walk just anywhere in the hotel but our waiter Dominique took us on a tour of the spa. It was very nice of him to offer to do this for us. We really enjoyed it. Thank you Dominique for adding that little extra to our visit to the Burj Al Arab!","5","2016-02"
"The Pinnacle of Luxury","We spent two nights at the Burj Al Arab and could not have been happier nor more impressed with the service and the facilities.  Every aspect of the hotel was designed with perfection in mind.  One night we requested to have drinks at the sky bar before dinner.  Our butler said that the restaurant was closed, ""but don't worry, we will open it for you.""  The pool and locker rooms are amazing - the sauna and steam room have glass walls allowing guests to look out over the water, marina, and downtown Dubai.  Each time we came into our room there were more freebies waiting for us.  These were not typical freebies and were instead bottles of wine/champagne, cake, fruit, baklava, chocolates, etc.  My wife and I will 100% return to the Burj Al Arab.","5","2016-01"
"OMG","Fantasy burj al Arab
Iconic hotel in Dubai giving you a feeling you living in a sweet home not a hotel
Just believe me you gonna be whole when you Will see that magnificent hotel from inside
Enjoy your stay","5","2016-02"
"A little disappointed ","After coming here in 2004, and many visits to dubai since at other hotels, my husband decided this would be his destination for his 50th birthday treat, we had a good time as always in dubai as we know where places are so need no help in getting around. 
The hotel is lovely, but we felt like you couldn't move once in the room as the constant knocking on the door was irritating to say the least, the rooms are duplex so if u leave something downstairs and want to get it in your underwear u want to o feel like u r at home , however very time I got half way down the stairs I felt like they must know I was semi dressed as the door would go n I'd have to hot foot it back upstairs !! 

The restaurants are lovely but the prices are exorbitant, mojito's approx £20 each !!! Seriously !! And to be honest you can't beat Rhodes twenty 10 for a special dinner.

I think this is our last visit and we will be going back to Pam and her team at le royal meridien, where we feel the service is much more personal. 

","2","2016-02"
"The superlative luxury stay","We went for a week in October 2015 to celebrate exam results. The staff treated us literally like kings and made us feel at home and it was easy to adopt their truly opulent lifestyle. 
At the time the outdoor swimming pool was under renovation and this was a disappointment. However, I am promised once the renovations are complete there will be an even more luxurious experience to be held at the Burj. 
The staff were more than helpful but that is to be expected at such a prestigious and the room was utterly perfect. 
One criticism of the Burj would be that there was a limited supply of restaurants under our half board package. We were permitted to visit the Arabian restaurant and the pan-Asian. I thought for a 6 night stay this was not enough to provide a strong variety of food options. 

Having said this our stay was almost perfect and I still believe that this hotel is the most luxurious in the world as they like to claim. 
We stayed in a two bedroom suite but also viewed a one bedroom panoramic suite and in my opinion it was totally sublime. The spacing and and views were totally amazing and I will definitely stay there next time with my girlfriend. 

I wish to thank the Burj staff for a wonderful stay!","5","2015-10"
"Amazing place","Me and my partner visited Al Mahara for evening meal which was excellent. Food great service great can't fault the general experience....I would recommend this place if you are wanting a top end experience for that special occasion","5","2016-01"
"A special birthday treat but left very disappointed","We were given a gift certificate to eat at Jinsui - a buffet meal for two.  After making the reservation I was asked if there was a special occasion and I mentioned it was my husbands birthday. Duly noted. We arrived at the hotel and was wandering around as there was no one in the Lobby to tell us the restaurant location, so we were late for our dinner. I was asked for the gift voucher (its not groupon) and were shown to our seats.  After waiting a good ten minutes, we were handed towels and told there were no drinks included in the buffet quite abruptly. (yes we know this) and was asked for the voucher again. The meal was nice, the chefs were very helpful and the waiting staff were very over eager to please.  It's just unfortunate when we were left and paid the bill I had to remind them it was my husbands birthday and they forgot. So a special occasion and very expensive evening left a very bitter experience.  
We visited the hotel about 7 years ago and remember feeling the same actually.  I will never visit here again or recommend to visiting family and friends.","3","2016-02"
"Worth every bit..!!","This hotel is definitely worth every bit of it (even a worth multiple visits if one can afford lol)! Luxuriously spacious rooms, grand entrance, every floor and every room has its own butler!

We stayed for one night for our honeymoon. Our stay was so touching that they delivered us a cake and a card to congratulate our wedding! Amazing experience, highly recommended.","5","2015-05"
"Stunning hotel","Went here fir afternoon tea it was on our must do fir dubai.  Wow it was superb staff friendly viws fantastic food very tasty and lots of it would defines to recommend 
I booked it direct and we got a taxi there and back it's expensive but a real must do you cannot enter the hotel without a reservation ","5","2016-01"
"Do it!,,","Afternoon tea at the Burj is well worth it the whole experience from start to finish was superb the food was beautiful,the views were amazing and so was the Burj itself, to anyone visiting Dubai I would say this is a must do on anyone's list","5","2016-01"
"Best quality service benchmark","Visited for a couple times and after a couple months again. We travel a lot and consider this hotel being different and to be considered as benchmark to compare with other places. We saw a lot of progress in renovations. Whole pool restaurant renovated and new artificial island ready for outdoor pool. We enjoyed Junsui restaurant best for Asia food in middle east. ","5","2016-01"
"Afternoon tea, You MUST really treat yourself","OK so it is expensive, but you can't take it with you. The afternoon tea ""experience"" is a must if you are in Dubai. The service, ambience, food, tea selection and individual staff members all far exceed expectations.
 
We booked for 4.30pm, and managed to see both another amazing sunset and the lights of Dubai spread before us in the darkness. 

Following a great “tea experience” it is worthwhile ending the day and starting the evening with a cocktail before setting off to re-join the ""real"" world.

If this is not on your bucket list then it should be.","5","2016-01"
"Afternoon Tea - Perfect in every way","Although to stop here was out of our price the Afternoon Tea although pricey was not. It is expensive but you are paying for the experience as much as what you eat. Although my expectations were not high for the afternoon tea I was most impressed with the number of dishes that were served and of course the quality could not be questioned. The service was impeccable and a nice touch was a gift of chocolates and commemorative pen for the both of us.","5","2015-11"
"Afternoon tea is a must!","Wow, what amazing service from Jescar in the Skyview Bar! We enjoyed a 7 course afternoon tea with bubbles last Sunday and absolutley enjoyed it. It was a real treat and whilst a little pricey, it is worth it. The views are fantastic from the bar on the 27th floor, especially as the sun started to set. I would absolutely recommend a visit, treat yourself, you're in Dubai after all!","5","2016-01"
"Photographic visit","Really the hotel is about it's striking situation and appearance, rather than its amenities which are in my opinion, overrated.
But it is truly special to see, and magic to photograph, particularly at night. Try from the beach either side of the causeway leading to the actual hotel.","4","2016-01"
"Afternoon Tea - Skyview Bar","We decided to treat ourselves whilst in Dubai and have Afternoon Tea at the Burj al Arab. It might have been pricey but it was worth every penny (620AED per person). I booked a date and time directly with the Burj al Arab before we flew out, you need to provide credit card details at the time of booking but you can pay on the day.

The hotel itself looked absolutely amazing, such a grand entrance. We arrived around 30 minutes prior to our booking and enjoyed having a little look around the foyer and reception area. Lots of photo opportunities. I'd requested a window table at the time of booking which they cannot guarantee but we were delighted to find that we had one when we arrived. The colours inside the Skyview Bar are beautiful against the blue skies and blue sea view. 

The courses were as follows : - 

Dates
Glass of Louis Roederer Brut 
White Chocolate ""Petit Pot"" with Strawberry
Duck Confit Pie with Ceps and Foie Gras and Cranberry Dressing
Finger Sandwiches
Lychee and Rose Sorbet
Homemade Scones with Devonshire clotted cream and homemade jams
Collection of Mini Patisseries

Everything was absolutely delicious. After the finger sandwiches were served, the waiters offered a second helping. Same with the Collection of Mini Patisseries. By the time he offered a second helping of those though, we honestly could not eat another thing. 

You could also have an unlimited selection of soft drinks - iced tea, iced coffee, fruit juices and tea/coffee. We had an iced coffee throughout the meal and then afterwards sat with a nice café au lait. There was no rush to leave. We were there for almost three hours. 

A very nice touch was after we'd finished the food the waiters brought round a ""Gift"" which was a lovely little box with some chocolate inside and a gold/white pen with Burj al Arab. A lovely little keepsake of a great day.

We thought it was worth every penny and wouldn't hesitate to go back if we are ever lucky enough to visit Dubai again. Perhaps this time though we'd go for dinner instead, or try afternoon tea in the Sahn Eddar for something different. 

Its worth noting that we were a bit concerned about getting a taxi back to our hotel afterwards as we were not sure of the etiquette. However, once we got outside they called a driver over and he took us back to our hotel, they said it was approximately 10% more expensive than a normal taxi.... which are cheap as chips anyway! 

Definitely worth a visit, highly recommended.","5","2015-09"
"This place is overrated. Time for an update.","Sorry. Did not like it. Kitschy all over the place. Quality is worse than you'd expect. 
It is a landmark and special but too much fuss. 
Architecture is great. Atrium also good. Views amazing. 
But there's a kind of luxury that doesn't belong there Looks like it's made for snobs. No offense. 
The Jumeirah group has great hotels but this is not one of them (anymore).
Wanted to visit it since I was a kid and saw documentaries about it on Discovery but I guess I was too late to enjoy its beauty. Time for a serious update.
Service was good but that shouldn't be a surprise. 
I see it more for 50+ category in need of showing their status. 
Check in at every floor is a good idea. 
Overall - the hotel didn't have a ""soul"". Looked artificial. That is hard to prove with arguments but easy when you just feel it. 
Choose Jumeirah's Zabeel Saray instead! Just so you keep it in the family.","2","2015-10"
"SO OVER-RATED IT'S SAD","Visited the Bar at the top for few drinks and a bite to eat . First of all I wish I didn't get the booking which was done for me , because supposedly it's impossible to get in ha 
ha .
The only semi interesting thing about this place it's the iconic looking building from outside. The bar at the top nothing special and the view that you get you can have 
from so many other buildings around. My cocktail which was served in a mini champagne flute was almost 40 Euros ( believe me not worth 20 which you would pay for an amazing drink in a proper sized glass at Kempinski Hotel or The Four Seasons . I've ordered burger , however, when the plate arrived I had 2 small sliders in front of me for the price of almost 50 Euros with fries that were completely cold . Appetiser of Ceviche ( 4 small bites at the most ) over 40 Euros and a bottle of pelegrino which was over 10 Euros . I am lucky I didn't order the 6 plain oysters which were 80 Euros ( trust me they don't come with a perl inside ha ha 
Save yourself money and go to a place where you will have a great ambience and good time . After my visit I was told by a local business man , that Burj al Arab perhaps was the place 10 years ago when there was nothing there , but now trust me go the Bar 360 , The One and Only ( spectacular ) The Four Seasons and so many other places at half the price and so much better . 
Whatever you do , you must visit Emirate Palace in Abu Dhabi which is operated by Kempinski . This hotel doesn't need stars because from the moment you enter the place you'll be speechless .

"Afternoon Tea.","We was on a girly holiday and decided to do something different and once in a lifetime!! 
So we booked the Afternoon Tea, we was so looking forward to this. 
On arrival the staff were very polite and told us where to go. We went to the Skyview bar in the lift which was amazing as you could see the sea. 
I did request that we had a window seat via email before attending. They did put us at the window seat which was amazing and would recommend for you to do this!!! 

After the 6 course Afternoon Tea along with all the drinks we wanted we left 3 hours later very full. 
I would recommend that you must go and try this experience as its a must do!!","5","2016-01"
"Timeless - it's aged amazingly well","I'm sure you can find a thousand reviews of this amazing hotel, but the one thing I would like to add is that this hotel is now 17 years old (as I write this) and it is still as breathtaking when you enter as the day it was when it opened just in time for the millennium. 

You really should pay the place a visit if you're in Dubai - even if it's just for afternoon tea or cocktails.","5","2015-12"
"They have thought of everything","We stayed 2 nights a the Al Arab. It was spectacular. Everything you could want. On arrival you are greeted and shown up by one lady and then you are given a butler. You are given free chocolates, baklava and a bottle of wine. Free his and hers Hermes perfumes, toiletries etc Of course those all small pleasures. The real experience is staying the staggering apartment itself. It is over 2 floors, floor to ceiling windows overlooking the marina and could clearly see the Palm. Watch the sunrise and sunset. The furniture is all very comfortable and the fittings are very over the top in a nautical style as you expect. You have your own Mac and printer and office area to sort out any admin. Luxurious jacuzzi bath and shower. The indoor hotel infinity pool and hot tub was wonderful as well. My daughter enjoyed the kids club but I would say it could have been a little more fancy just to go with the rest of the hotel though it was fine. Other than that, I don't what to say it was amazing. I would recommend anybody to try it, as it was totally worth it.","5","2016-01"
"Luxurious!","Great hotel with great service. The room was huge, it had two floors. The place was much more then what I expected. The only disappointment was there was no 24k gold ipad in the room as advertised. Overall great quiet place!

Tip: when getting a cab get the Lexus cab, its not a big difference in the regular cab price. ","5","2015-07"
"just perfect","Have stayed here in June 2015. Everything was perfect! Room, housekeeping, service,attention to details... . Would have expected a bit more from both of the breakfast buffets and this is something which should be looked at. Will definitely come return back to this impressing hotel.","5","2015-06"
"Personalized service , beyond cmpare","We booked Muntaha restaurant for an anniversary celebration on Dec 23,2015. We informed the booking executives about the celebration to make some special arrangement for the sitting. But later we cancelled that one and reserved Junsui for Dec 25,2015. 

We are not going to describe the fabulous authentic meal at Junsui, but we were absolutely flabbergasted when we found that the guests were given a special anniversary cake and a rose bouquet as a token, though the reservation staff were not informed of any special occasion for that day of Dec 25..This arrangement left us with nothing but to appreciate the hospitality of the Burj Al Arab.

This hospitality is something which one looks for , when we go for a good restaurant, though we were not provdied with a similar response , when we dined at an equally renowned hotel on some other day.","5","2015-12"
"Burj Al Arab Jumeirah Beach","The Jumeirah Beach pretty much next door to the burj al arab and the jumeirah beach hotel. The beach is white sand with a very docile water front. The views from here are spectacular if you haven't been before and when I was last there it wasn't so busy, because many people don't understand why you would go on a beach that you don't pay for.","5","2016-01"
"Burj Al Luxury","Just Amazing!!!

We came to Burj Al Arab to celebrate my wife's birthday. As soon as we arrived at the hotel entrance (the security at the pre-entrance checks the name against booking and relays it to the reception), our hostess Melanie was ready to welcome us. We were whisked to the 10th floor Panoramic Suite and all the check-in formalities were completed there. The suite was truly gorgeous. It spanned over two floors and the winding staircase was simply from a movie set. The lower floor had a study table, a bar, dining table with fruit platters, a huge sitting area with TV. The upper floor had the king sized bed, more sofas, a TV hidden if not used, the luxury bathroom (with a Jacuzzi and branded toiletries) and a very large closet. Every metal part was gilded giving a truly resplendent image. But the main taking point should be the service. The floor butler desk arranged that one will need. Shinto explained us the layout and the gadgetry inside the suite. Then of course there was a 3 member band signing happy birthday to my wife and giving her a bouquet of flower and a chocolate cake and personal card from the hotel manager. There was a small train trolley that brought candies for my son. We drank the complementary red wine in the evening while watching the sunset and admiring the views of Mainland Dubai stretching up to the horizon and the views of the Palm and Atlantis. The fireworks at the Marina was clearly visible and was icing on the cake. Of course the sun rise the next day provided another experience.

The breakfast at recently renovated poolside restaurant Al Iwan had a good spread. The hospitality extended by Jomin is worth to be noted. Next I and my son headed to the executive pool of Jumeira Beach Hotel. This is probably one of the longest swimming pools in the region and we enjoyed swimming and the integrated Jacuzzi there. The stay was extended to 3 PM at our request and that was a nice gesture from the resort. The staff behaviour was impeccable throughout. We have stayed in a few luxury properties in the Middle East and this is definitely the best we have stayed so far.","5","2016-01"
"Adorable Place","It was the nicest experience of all times .Although Dubai has many hotels but the kind of care and concern which employees have for there guest is truly amazing and that makes this huge building more beautiful and unique . I would like to mention one name susanne who portrayed the true real meaning of hospitality and made the day of my family .","5","2016-01"
"Deserves every one of its 7 stars!!!","My Husband and I often go to the Jumeriah Beech Hotel and absolutely adore this for our family holidays but we just got married on New Years Eve and wanted to spoil ourselves as we would be child free.  We were slightly sceptical about staying at the Burj as we thought is was going to be very snooty and full of pretentious people... and although there was the odd few of them floating around with their self importance we actually cannot rate this the hotel and the service highly enough.  
We booked a one bedroom panoramic suite and cannot tell you how wow a room this is!! Its a duplex suite and with stunning views all round it was hard to want to leave the room.  
We arrived and were taken care of immediately with our own 24 hour butler who came introduced himself and then unpacked our cases whilst we took in our surroundings!!  Our Butlers name was Robert and cannot recommend him highly enough by the end of our 5 night stay Robert was like one of the family. He helped arrange the fantastic helicopter tour of Dubai which to take off from the Burj's private helipad and land again is an experience in itself, nothing was too much trouble for him and he would organise and book all our restaurants... it was just sheer opulence. I have to admit when we were first told we had a Butler we thought it would all be a bit too much and too fussy but quite honestly he made our stay and we would request Robert on our next stay too, he became a friend and got to know our likes very quickly.
The overall service and the staff are excellent so friendly and literally cannot do enough for you, we literally spent most days by the pool talking to the staff in the Bab al Yam Bar, who we got to know so well!!  The managers Satish & Jalill were outstanding and helped arrange some lovely surprises for us with my new husband.  They ran an impeccable outfit and had some of the loveliest people working for them that do them very proud.
If you do stay there look out for the bartender Jomin he absolutely made our stay such a fantastic young man, so friendly and his standard of service was beyond the extra mile... he kept bringing us gorgeous cocktails and delicious snacks!!
All the above people were just amazing and because of these people and their colleagues we will definitely be coming back.
The food and restaurants are unbelievable and nothing is too much trouble for anyone, the cleanliness too is exceptional.
If your looking for a stay in the lap of luxury, to feel so special and to experience service like no other then this is definitely the hotel for you!!
Thank you for an awesome honeymoon guys... we will be seeing you very soon!!","5","2016-01"
"A FIEST TO THE EYES","A wonderful piece of architecture. It was my first visit to Dubai and I observed that every building is a masterpiece and is different from the other. I wish everyone should visit at least once in a lifetime.","5","2016-01"
"Luxury at its best...","I have stayed at many Jumeirah Group Hotels over the last 15 years and Burj Al Arab has been regular on my list...the overall service, room quality, restaurant & food variety has always been great...the service levels are extremely high at this hotel with exceptional care from all staff, well worth it...","5","2015-06"
"Absolutely Amazzzing!!!","This is our second time, this time we stayed three nights, and it was fantastic; Of course everything is very ""over-the-top"", but it's Disneyland for adults. We take care of us from beginning the USA.  Nice and courteous limo drivers surprised us at the airport in a Rolls! We had dinner with George, the huge green-blue fish restaurant aquarium. Excellent restaurant, the aquarium is beautiful. the beach is very nice and the hotel view is magical, when you love architecture. The Spa is amazing and indoor pool stunning, must see. Only downside, too many rude Russian gangsters disrespecting the Dress Code and photos. I dream of returning. Everything was perfect, the staff is exceptional. A must for every Bucket Lister.","5","2015-12"
"Indescribable ","We had a panoramic suite whichwas incredible..... the staff were amazing and the whole experience was second to none. The breakfast was delicious and very fresh with a wide variety of food. The swimming pool indoors was excellent and very clean. The butlers very attentive and there for your every need. Internet extremely fast and free of course. Will go back in the future for sure","5","2016-01"
"Afternoon Tea at an exclusive Hotel.","During our recent stay in Dubai my husband and I had Afternoon Tea here as part of an organised trip which also included the ""At the Top"" trip up Burj Khalifa. We were welcomed in to the foyer of the hotel, which was still magnificently decorated for Christmas, then taken up to the atrium where we were seated on plush sofas ready for the Afternoon Tea. This began with a glass of Champagne which we enjoyed while listening to the harpist and taking in our wonderful surroundings. It wasn't the usual Afternoon Tea with delicate cake stands full of sandwiches and cakes which you help yourself to, each course was delivered separately. There were 5 courses altogether which were all delicious, but my main complaint is that the actual tea wasn't served until the scones arrived as the 4th course. By this time everyone was really thirsty and several people were asking for glasses of water. I love Afternoon Tea and have had many, including a Birthday treat last year at Claridges, and every one serves tea straight away and offers more sandwiches. The service was quite slow, which was only a problem for us as we had to rush off to Burj Khalifa, so we had to rush the final selection of mini cakes and didn't have enough time to finish the long-awaited tea. For the price charged I expected better.","4","2015-12"
"What a place!!","Went a few years ago and thought i would finally write a review.
What can you say about one of the few 7 star hotels in the world? This place is amazing and is the best hotel i have ever been to. From the staff who greet you at reception, to managers/porters alike, you will receive excellent customer service. 
When dining in one of the many restaurants, we would be welcomed by name by the manager who would get one of his staff to escort us to the table. The choice of food on offer is out of this world and is an experience in itself.
For drinks, the Sky Bar is just simply wonderful. As you would expect, all drinks are pricey ( i think it cost approx £13 for a bottle of bud when we went), but its such a fantastic environment and worth a visit.
All staff in the hotel are just wonderful. We arranged a tour of the Presidential suite and were amazed at the size of it and the attention to detail. It even had a lift in the room!
The private beach is just exceptional. And as a guest of the Burj, you get free entry to the Wild Wadi Water park which is also another must do place. 
I would love to go back but having sold one of my kidneys to fund the last visit (joke!), i'm reluctant to get rid of the other one. But one day i will return to experience this amazing hotel.
The views from the rooms are simply breathtaking, we stayed in one of the rooms overlooking The Palm.","5","2015-02"
"Afternoon tea 4*","Myself and my wife went here for afternoon tea . The hotel itself is amazing . How the other half live i wish i was the other half haha . We went to the sky lounge . The afternoon tea was very good nut not the best we have had . But the view alone is worth it . The staff were very nice friendly . ","4","2016-01"
"Definitely an experience I won't forget - amazing hotel","I stayed here for a night for my birthday and it certainly was a very unique experience. The rooms are amazing duplex floors, the hotel is all suite. Service was exceptional, food was excellent. The pool is a little small, but fantastic views. It’s a very unique and iconic hotel, a must see for any luxury hotel lover!","5","2015-05"
"Superior quality service and excellence in all","We consider this hotel as the best for quality of guest hospitality. Quality of all aspects of stay is on the top level and it starts with being Welcomed at airport in Jumeirah launge
Transport from airport by BMW class 7
Welcome in hotel with flowers at entrance
Welcome on the room floor in own reception and own buttler service. I was welcomed and received 2 very nice flowers from the guest relationsmanager. It pleased me and made to feel a special. Very delighted.
We loved dining in Junsui asia food restaurant
We noticed major Renovations and improvement we would like appreciate the ouside pool and poolside restaurant

We booked one bedroom suite and
Winter dream package including
Junsui and Al Iwan halfboard - we preferred Junsui due awesome selection and quality of japanese, thai and china cuisine.

Massage in SPA - excellent very experienced masseur with 9 years experience performed on excellent level

Due beginning of January Russian Christmas too many noise rusians and and musical performance running show until 23hrs. Hotel appologized and offered alternative room on other side of building.

The wether was rather could so we spend time in SPA and inside pool.

During this period is as well DSF Dubai shoping festival, some top brands stores offer up to 70% discounts. Shopping in close by mall Mall of Emirates is more covenient than going to Dubai mall.

"Truly Amazing Experience","We had lunch here on Christmas Day & from the moment we entered the incredible lobby I knew we had made the right decision.  This hotel is amazing! The decor is sumptuous but tasteful. The staff are unobtrusive yet helpful and the food was to die for. Views are fantastic. This is a truly wonderful hotel and should be on your list if visiting Dubai.","5","2015-12"
"Mediocre to say the least","Did not meet expectations at all.  Stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world that are far better than what Burj Al Arab advertise and deliver.  Overpriced for what you pay.  Could not even chance the Disney channel to english and that is something so basic.","2","2015-05"
"Unique","Just had dinner at Bab el Yam restaurant a few hours ago and the whole experience is just unbelievable right from the second you step into the reception hall - jaw dropping .
The food was exceptionally good and refined ( buffet ) ; the attention of the waiters and waitresses and of course the setting .
It wasn't cheap , but will go back again definitely .
Just beyond what I had expected .
A must do in Dubai , but make sure you book your table Well in advance . ","5","2016-01"

what looks like gold is gold and staff is very friendly and helpful. Al Ivan at the first floor for late lunch was an excellent choise and the view from the top bar is just stunning!","5","2015-02"
"Excellent","In October i had brunch with my family. We had to make booking online which was easy to do. Altogether 10 of us went. There was a big range of different type of buffet food. Food tasted amazing but there were few dishes that was bland. Desert section was fantastic. Customer service was great.","5","2015-10"
"Great place","Went here for a short break in December. The place was absolutely delightful and the service exceptional. You pay a lot but it's worth it for such a delight.  Each room has its own butler service and the views are breathtaking.  The beach wasn't crowded and the waves were the highlight for our kids. This is without doubt the best hotel in Dubai. ","5","2015-12"
"Sky Tea – an experience for life!","My wife and I visited the world famous Bur Al Arab for afternoon tea at the Sky View Bar located on the 27th floor.  This is a very expensive treat (AED 620 per person) but worth every penny! This is one of the most iconic buildings in the world and to see it from outside is great, but to visit and experience the hospitality and outstanding service is another thing!

Book the 4pm sitting so you can admire the beautiful sunset. Book a window table (no guarantee so arrive early - 30 minutes before). The best seats are those on the right hand side of the restaurant with view of the coastline and towards Bur Khalifa (worlds tallest building). 

You have plenty of time to admire and take amazing  photos in the outstanding lobby before/after the Sky Tea.  See my attached photos from the Sky Tea area – and the lobby - and you will understand why I mean Sky Tea in this world famous hotel is worth every penny!

Highly recommended!

"Amazing","Hi Everyone,

Had the pleasure of visiting this 7 star kingdom once again and as always totally amazing experience.  Great for family with children.  

Dined in the Al Iwan Arabian cuisine restaurant which again was faultless.  A must is the golden Arab mocktail as well as the rose water welcome drink before you enter.

All staff very helpful and a great experience to share with friends & Family.

Thank you Ahmed Ereiba for totally looking after us.  A great ambassador to the Burj Al Arab.

See you again soon. HNY2016","5","2016-01"
"An Amazing Experience","The service in this hotel is amazing. Everyone makes you feel very welcome, relaxed and looked after. The rooms are unbelievable. It was my birthday and they really helped us celebrate in style. Cannot really fault it.","5","2015-12"
"Excellent in-suite dining experience","Having stayed at the Burj Al Arab several times before I thought a review was long overdue.
The first thing to say is that the hotel lives up to it's reputation and each time we've come away wanting to return. What was particularly impressive about this most recent visit was the in-suite dining. We had pre-selected a 5-course dinner prior to our stay but on arrival we needed to make a couple of changes which were accommodated without fuss. The sommelier also visited our suite on the day so that we could select from the extensive wine list. The dining room was discretely set up without anyone in the family (4 of us) even noticing (there's a separate service door) despite being in the suite the entire time. Service started at the requested time and the team of 4 staff were fantastic throughout the evening. Each course was superbly prepared and arrived at the table in perfect condition - it was easy to forget that you weren't actually in a restaurant. After the meal we retired to the lounge for coffee and the table was cleared just as discretely as it had been set up. I cannot recommend the experience enough and it is testament to the attention to detail that the Burj Al Arab is synonymous with. Interestingly I felt the food was incredibly good value for money at 550AED per person given the quality of the food and exceptional level of service. By contrast the wine is very toppy but probably no more so than anywhere else in Dubai (and they do have some exceptionally good wines on the list).
Finally it's definitely worth arriving by helicopter too (see photo)!","5","2015-12"
"What an amazing experience!","I stayed at this hotel for one night as a surprise birthday present off my husband and I cannot fault the level of service we received from start to finish.
We arrived and were ushered straight to our room for check in by a lovely lady. She also gave us a guided tour of the hotel as it was our first stay.
The rooms are amazing with everything you could possibly wish for, from a nice bottle of Burj al Arab red wine to full size Hermes toiletries.
At around 6pm the butler came to offer us a drink to celebrate the special occasion followed by cake and roses.
We visited the Junsui restaurant for dinner which again was amazing. Sadly we'd filled up on nibbles in the Skyview bar so was not able to take full advantage of the buffet therefore we will return again.
I can honestly say that no matter how much or how little you have all of the guests are treated the same and I will definitely be making another trip back to this hotel in my lifetime.","5","2015-11"
"Royal treatment","We went for high tea and were spoiled to bits! Although I found  it overpriced, but then again, you do this once in your life and you are treated like royalty (high tea price is UAD 625 inclusive a  gift)! 
If you want to go primarily  for the view, you can also book to go to the bar, you get drinks and nuts and pay less (just the price of the drinks) 
","5","2015-11"
""" The Burj Factor ""","We had a three day stay at the start of December but did not want to write my review until the new renovation of Bab Al Yam had been completed....we are in Dubai for Christmas and knew the pool area and restaurant was open. Big change for the better as felt the pool area let the hotel down. Light and bright with change in variety of foods and run by Satish and his team.The staff we have met over the years are now friends and thanks to all to include the great chefs in Al Iwan and restaurant manager, Stephanie who is always there with a smile along with Nimal....you are in for a great experience...so much so someone once said to us if you stay there once You will keep returning .","5","2015-12"
"Perfectionist.....","The moment, I get to the main lobby, I was stunned by the interior, exclusively stunning. The room that we checked in, i should say, perfectionist, the color combination, the interior, the bed, so comfy and yes, is worth what you paying for.","4","2015-01"
"Pure luxury","It was a one night of pampering and pure luxury. I am pretty sure this experience will be remembered by me for years to come. Just to let you know guys they only offer suites, as I a result you will be enjoying the extremely huge space given to you over 2 levels, in addition to a gift for both of you by Hermes...isn't that great. Finally, I would definitely recommend staying at Burj Alarb for those seeking an unforgettable dream.","5","2015-12"
"What a place","I am lost for words, stunning and the best in the World by far but very very expensive if you have to ask how much you are looking at the wrong hotel, spent 4 mths there on level 6 with my work ( out of this world )","5","2015-01"
"Holiday","Excellent, very very different, its out of this world. So please don't miss it. 
Most wonderful place to go too.
You will be treated like a queen.
Amazing hotel.

Every thing is so nice that you don't want to leave.
So relaxing, 
The staff is so friendly. 
You will feel you are very much comfortable and you will enjoy every moment of your stay.

"Supreme decadence and luxury","From the moment to arrive at the entrance you are treated like a princess. I felt I was staying in a Saudi Princes's home. Our suite overlooking the marina, with the skyline and Burj kalifa in then distance was truly outstanding. The service is impeccable.
What is it with some people that criticise this wonderful seven star hotel. Just goes to show ""you can't please all the people ...""
Love it! love it! love it ! - looking forward to returning - absolute heaven.","5","2015-12"
"Stunning is not even enough to describe what this place is","There is not much else to say about this hotel that others have not said yet: superb in every and all ways?? Yup. That and much more. Our stay was of only 3 nights as we headed to Qatar for our friend´s wedding. Wish we could have stayed more as this place is such a great treat. Attention was unique and so all the other services.","5","2015-12"
"Afternoon tea","A once in a lifetime experience, everyone deserves to be spoilt now and again, and this was the epitomy of being spoilt.  Amazing location and views, fabulous afternoon tea, starting with a glass of bubbly.  Gifts of a rose, and a beautiful box with a pen and chocolates. 

The very best afternoon tea, ever!","5","2015-12"
"The best there is","First, the moment you arrive someone greets you, you are offered some traditional food and beverage and you are taken DIRECTLY to your suite. 
     On every floor there are butlers wich help you with everything you need. In the room you have an office(with an iMac computer, printer and scanner), and two floors of luxury and technology. 
     Views are great from both up and downstairs, siute is huge(over 110sqm) and every suite is on two levels. 
     I could go on and on about it but the main thing is 
 this hotel will meet the highest expectations, it's definitely a must, at least once in a lifetime.","5","2015-11"
"Wonderful and elegant, definately 7 star but the card readers didn't work when it came to paying the bill.","We booked the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea and had an absolutely fabulous time. The food was thoughtfully prepared and served, looked and tasted delicious. We were not rushed and our teenage boys enjoyed the experience as much as we did. Seven delightful courses was much more than expected and my wife even turned down a cake! When we came to pay my wife's credit card was declined, thinking that was strange I handed my card to the waiter to also have it declined (both IHG Barclay cards). Both my wife and I rang our credit card provider to find out what was happening, only to both be told there was no problem with our cards but it was their readers. We were ushered to a discreet ATM by the Burj staff to withdraw cash, luckily I managed to withdraw some from my business account! It was only then that one of the waiters admitted that this had been happening over the last few days and the finance department had been notified. 

Again, an out of this world experience, something my wife has been looking forward to since March, however, please save other customers from having a very embarrassing 10 mins and get your card readers sorted out.","4","2015-12"
"Great hotel","This is an amazing hotel. Has an amazing view between water. The bar in this hotel is also a good romantic place. The afternoon view from this hotel is superb and we can enjoy the sunset. Of course over priced but worth a visit","4","2015-06"
"TO BE OR NOT TO BE","When I found out we were going to stay at the Burj I was in shock and awe. From all that I heard about the hotel I was beyond excited. Aesthetically beautiful hotel. Fountains and aquarium all in the foyer.  Lush carpets and perfectly situated waiting areas.  The room was exquisite.  Double storey room with a kitchen, billiard room, tv lounge, sitting lounge and toilet. Upstairs work station beautiful canopied bed, jacuzzi bath and jet shower. Truly an absolute dream.  We had a floor butler which i felt was an extravagance but they were very pleasant.

the amenities around the hotel are pretty standard.  The indoor pool and jacuzzi were a treat. The gym facilities very posh.  The restuarants were exquisite. The japanese restuarant where we had breakfast was outstanding. The variety of foods on offer made it a memorable, sleep inducing (due to overindulgence) experience.

The little golf carts to take you to different parts of the complex were fantastic.  Overall a really enjoyable experience but definitely a once in a lifetime.","5","2015-10"
"Wonderful experience","Wonderful experience we went for afternoon tea very special indeed sparking drinks first the white and milk chocolate fondant followed by tea from so many brews you could choose  duck in pastry ,sorbet ,sandwiches artisan bread ie to tomatoe bread  spinach etc the scones and jams and cream of which we had 9 pots of cream then cakes including a Birthday cake for Granddaughter Eliza who was 14 the whole experience was one to remember and the fish tank in the Foyer if you could call it that was the whole of the wall on both sides of the escalator at night the sails outside changed colour along with the pillars of Gold inside   You just have to go it's once in a life time","5","2015-11"
"Long awaited visit ","I have stayed at the other jurmirah hotels on a regular basis and always said to my husband "" one day we will stay at the Burj"". We stayed for three nights at the end of November followed by three nights in the medinat. We booked a Panoramic suite and although we requested a high floor were on level 6. 
I was expecting amazing service such as an offer to unpack/ pack and maybe iron clothes but this never happened. Nor did we ever see a gold I pad! 
It was an amazing suite as you can see from the pictures on the website. We had a great view of the building works! 
I was delighted to move to the medinat where service was fab, breakfast superb and we had a lovely balcony and fabulous view. 
Glad to have ticked the burj off my ""to do list"" but would not choose to stay again. ","3","2015-11"
"Drinks in the lobby and nibbles!","Wow the hotel is so beautiful and a must see for afternoon tea and drinks or evening meal ! 

I assure you it is 100% worth it ! 

We didn't book so had to pay a tad more so advice is book online before hand :) 

But they managed to fit us in and we had a beautiful seti area in the lobby this is situated on the 2nd floor with a piano and live music with amazing views! Not your typical hotel lobby :D

We enjoyed hours of cocktails with nibbles listening to the music ! Truly relaxing and stunning interior to observe whilst there ! 

Defiantly lives up to its 7stars!!","5","2015-12"
"Always makes us feel special....","We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  We rocked up on a buggy, (which is quite amusing as there are Rollers and Ferraris adorning the parking area) as we were coming from JBH. 

We had booked a panoramic suite which is just so beautiful.  I always feel that three nights in this hotel leaves you feeling as chilled and spoilt as seven nights in most other hotels.  We waited maybe ten minutes for our suite; what followed was a delivery of super flowers as an apology for keeping us waiting (take heed BA - we would still be at DXB now if we had waited for their arranged transfer).

As always beautiful, helpful staff, lovely touches in the suite- fruit, wine , full his and hers Hermes toiletries to name but a few.  

Breakfast in the room or the restaurant was included and the array of offerings is spectacular.

The hotel is currently constructing a new pool and beach area ( I think this will be welcome to those seeking privacy).  The construction did not particularly bother us at all.  

As always we enjoyed the Sky Bar for both drinks and Mezzeh.  Al Mahara is lovely but as usual eye-wateringly expensive on the wine front.

We met a couple who told us they come to BAA four times a year- way out of our league, but I could understand why!","5","2015-12"
"Special","Loved it!!!! What can i say...Enjoyed it and can't complain about a thing...Amazing View and great restaurants. If you are looking to do something special for your other half then give the Burj Al Arab a try and am sure you won't regret it one bit.

"Best Hotel on Earth","One of the most iconic and dramatic buildings on the planet.  With a level of service to match.  Staff manage to stay somewhat grounded despite the hefty price tag.  Not pretentious in any way.  Amazing lobby, atrium and lounges.","5","2015-11"
"A billion pound night","Ending up in burj al arab is something everyone dreams of! I got to experience things out of this world! the cuisine was something unreal, the service was perfect, the staff were most welcoming but the leaving was a regret.","5","2015-07"
"A dream","The architecture- The sight in itself while approaching the hotel crossing over a bridge is stunning.  Once inside you will be blown over by the scale of this sail boat shaped wings and roof. Very elegantly designed and and bright colored. The view from the Panoramic room was excellent. The rooms were very well kept. 

Once we stepped in we received an very warm welcome and ushered straight away to our room. Once inside the room  a quick check-in process ensued and the private butler immediately took over and and explained all the details. 
We used the swimming pool on the 18th floor instead of going for the outdoor one and this also has a magnificent view. 

On the food front very limited choices if you are a vegetarian, but the private dining service could come to your rescue. 

Our thanks and appreciation to the Mr. Robert, Mr. Gaurav, Ms.Anila for the wonderful service they provided and made me and my family feel very welcome. Also would like to appreciate the warmth and courtesy shown by the room makeup staff.","5","2015-12"
"Wonderful Afternoon Tea in the Sahn Eddar Lounge","We experienced such a wonderful family treat in this architecturally interesting hotel.  We enjoyed a 7 course afternoon tea with Champagne and birthday cake in the beautiful Sahn Eddar hotel lounge. The service was excellent and well paced in that we could savour each delicious course and have enough room after a break between each to start again!  What we appreciated was the fact that we did not feel pressurised in any way that there was another sitting.","5","2015-12"
"Very special design","The Junaeirah beach has a great view of Burj al Arab, unique structure by its own.Very happy to spend special family moments with it. Its like 3 in 1, as we can see hotel, beach and park at same place.","5","2015-12"
"Culinary Flight was a huge disappointment","My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" experience while in Dubai. The evening started good enough in the Skybar where we had to make our food and drink orders for the 5 restaurants included in the ""Culinary Flight"". We chose to add the pairing wine menu to our food order and payed at total of 2.045 AED/person. Working as managers in the hospitality industry, we had high expectations (as one should have at this hotel and to the price they charge). The food was good but nothing special and the wine servings were ridiculously small in every restaurant. We felt that we were being rushed through the restaurants but when we reached the last one (aquarium) they were surprised to see us. We had to wait to be seated and the table was not set properly. We had to wait for the wine and the staff was not attentive at all.  After having been rushed to the lobby for a mediocre dessert and 2 cl of cognac, it was time to set the bill. My credit card did not work in the machine and I asked the waitress to try with another machine which she did without success. Instead she told me to go to the ATM to withdraw money!! Embarrassing and unprofessional when it was the card machine that was outdated (nothing wrong with my credit card). As a final gesture the hotel gives you a bouquet of roses. Nice, but not very thought out to give to tourists staying being on holiday... We left this beautiful hotel with a big sense of disappointment and a feeling of wasted money. I filled out the questionnaire I was sent a few days later where I stated all the above. I got a sincere apology but no offer whatsoever to a compensation of any kind. I do NOT recommend spending your money here!","1","2015-11"
"lifetime treat","Having stayed in lots of nice hotels including several stays in Dubai I spent a lot of time looking at the various options before booking the Burj. The price seemed outrageous and you can certainly stay in some lovely hotels for much much much less and yet .....so was it - is it worth the money?
I think so..... the building is iconic and a friend who was staying somewhere very posh insisted on coming to me when he normally wouldn't bother it has that sort of effect.
I stayed for 5 nights
the rooms are so lovely I thought there might be too much bling but the decor is truly lovely the split level rooms works so well and differentiate from elsewhere, the views are good. 
The Hermes products (replaced constantly) were a nice quality touch as they should be at this price point.
It is really a bucket list experience so do it if you can.
You need to watch the bills though a single small glass of ordinary cost a ridiculous £25 the only time I felt ripped off. I did the culinary flight which was nice but at about £50 per course so it should be - its not worth it for the food but it is worth it for the experience so its about memory creation and this cant be costed - so if you can do it,just do it - include breakfast and eat your other meals out        
the beach is nice and buggy service excellent
the staff are really good sometimes a bit too much so but they are plainly motivated and trained (and managed)
so all in all a great experience","5","2015-11"
"Birthday lunch","Just had a lovely birthday lunch at the Burj al Arab.  Not cheap but made to feel very special.  Food, wine and the overall service was great.  Will just need to start saving to pay the credit card bill though.  Ah well, that's one more thing off my bucket list.  Thanks Burj al Arab for making my day special.  ","5","2015-12"
"Don't choose it for bday dinner","We chose this hotel for my mom's bday expecting a 7 star hotel, and the food wasn't exceptional. Our dessert looked ordinary for the amount of money we payed for it. This hotel is great to go and take pictures and enjoy walking through it, but I wouldn't dine here again.","3","2014-12"
"Costs a month salary to stay for 1 night","Al though, it costs my month's earning to stay for 1 night, it is an out of the world experience. The wait staff, the breakfast, the rooms, the bathrooms, the ambiance, absolutely out of the world. Must visit once at any costs.","5","2015-11"
"4 star service ","I stayed at the burj al Arab, my first time I was really excited about staying here the hotel looks 7 stars sheikh Mohammed has made a dream come true. Shame about the customer service on arrival the person who is ment to greet us in totally missed us so waited there awkwardly finally the young lady found us. This was not like the video you see on YouTube were the guest come in and the staff are waiting for you with the tea refreshments disappointing. Ok so we go to the room it takes an hour before we got the right room as your ment to go straight to your room this was not the case. My family is emirati. Invited them over to the suite we ordered food and the customer service is  terrible we asked for extra plate and had to wait 30 mins by this time the food had gone cold the butler service is slow. The bedroom was not done only white sheets no colour at all I did not realise this until I got back from holiday. You are just paying for a name the service is more like 4 star then 7 star shame really as I was so excited to stay here and give the hotel top reviews.","4","2015-09"
"You Only Live Once!","I discovered what makes a hotel 7-Star and I am so fortunate to experience it! The service of all the staff at the Burj is indescribable. You must experience it. They know you by name from the moment you pass the security gate to arrive on the private island on which the hotel was built. The iconic hotel's structure is amazing in itself, but it is the staff that makes it special and warm. I had booked a 1BR Panoramic suite, but was told upon arrival that I was upgraded to the 2BR, 2 story suite with over 360sm (3600sf)! Our room was on the 12th floor (which is actually the 24th floor since all rooms are 2 stories). My family of 4 could not believe the size of all the rooms including the two bedrooms and bathrooms (see photos). But, again, it was not the room that made my birthday so special, but the personal service we received from everyone...from the main reception to our own floor reception and especially to our personal room butler! Anything we needed was personally handled by him plus more (including free chocolates for the kids from the Candyman every evening and cocktails for the Adults). The wife and I had a special dinner at the excellent seafood restaurant, Al Mahara, which included an additional course and cake for free while the hotel provided a quality babysitter for the boys. Not having to worry about the boys, we enjoyed after dinner drinks at the Sky View Bar in total luxury. Again, the service was 7 Star from the sommelier and staff at Al Mahara to the staff at the Sky View Bar who provided us a table at the edge looking over Burj Khalifa! Yes, it was expensive, but 'You Only Live Once' and, to me, this was the ultimate way to spend my 60th Birthday!!!","5","2015-10"
"Absolutely amazing place","I visited the Burj in July for my wife's birthday in July but put off writing a review as I didn't think I knew enough superlatives to describe this amazing hotel.
This isn't a hotel I could reasonably afford but thought as I was in Dubai and it was my wife's birthday, I would treat her (and me) to something special, that would normally be way out of my price bracket.
We booked the culinary flight, which is basically one course in 6 different restaurants - I figured this gave us the best chance to experience as much of the hotel and its restaurants as possible for the least amount of money ('least amount' is a relative term as this was by far the most I have ever spent on a meal) 
We were not allowed into the hotel until 30 minutes before our meal but as soon as we arrived at the front of the hotel we were treated like royalty. A quick look around the shops and public areas and then we were taken upstairs (we were escorted at all times by polite and friendly staff) to the top floor bar for cocktails. As it was Ramadan at the time of our visit, we had to wait till 1930 and sunset before we were allowed to eat or drink alcohol. This gave us the chance to watch the sunset over the Red Sea - amazing views whilst drinking cocktails and enjoying nibbles and ordering our food from a set menu.
We were collected from here after 30 mins or so and escorted to our first restaurant, Al Muntaha for our first course. All of the staff were amazing and we were called at all times by our names by the very attentive staff ( welcome Mr ........, is everything ok Mr .......) I dropped a knife and the waitress was so quick she almost caught it before it landed on the floor - immediately replaced, it was almost impossible to pour our own drinks as the staff wanted to do absolutely everything to make our experience fantastic and memorable.
I ordered Hand Cut Wagyu Beef Tartare, which came with Kristal Caviar and tasted amazing.
Then downstairs to the Al Iwan Arabian buffet restaurant for the next course, jumbo prawns and sea scallops. - all of the food we ate was like the final of Masterchef and was of amazing quality and taste and beautifully presented.
Next course was in the oriental restaurant Junsuc. Again the usually fantastic standard of food, crispy Peking duck this time. My wife had Asian Spicy Coconut Cream Soup with noodles, salmon and prawns, which was a better choice and tasted far better than any equivalent I have ever experienced in Bangkok or Singapore.
Main course was in the hotels signature restaurant - Al Mahara, which is underwater and you eat next to a huge fish tank with sharks, eels and fish of all shapes, sizes and descriptions swimming past you. I had the seared Angus beef as I wanted to experience a steak as it should be cooked. Again it was absolutely amazing and surpassed our expectations. The head waiter was very friendly and told us stories of the people who had eaten in the restaurant (very discretely of course) and of the Hollywood stars (unnamed of course ) who used the secret staircases to access the smaller private dining rooms with their entourages. Fascinating man, whom we could have listened to all night.
Final course was desert in the foyer restaurant Sahn Edgar - Basque custard pie and a cheesecake unlike any we have ever experienced. 
As it was my wife's birthday we were also given a birthday cake, (which was the best of the 3 cakes we were given that day!) and a round of 'happy birthday' and flowers from the staff.
An absolutely amazing experience which I would recommend to anyone who loves food and can afford a once in a lifetime experience or maybe some people can afford this every day!
","5","2015-07"
"this place screams opulence!","Staying here is an unforgettable experience.  There are no rooms, only suites in this hotel - that gives one an indication of the level of luxury it provides. The ocean view from our 16th floor suite was amazing - and the view inside was even more amazing.  Welcomed with a box of baklava sweets instead of the usual chocolates, fresh red roses on the table, full size Hermes toiletry, a choice of about 15 different pillows, and to top it all - the choice of changing the mattress to a softer or a firmer one - now that's something totally unheard of!","5","2015-11"
"Great hotel","The Burj al Arab is a great hotel, I enjoyed my stay there and found the service best of all.
The entrance was great and I got a warm welcome from the staff, walking up the stairs with the fountains and was amazed by the beauty of it.
The room was great and very spacious. Being able to use the cars of the Burj al Arab was also a great experience.

Over all it was one of the finest hotels I ever stayed in.

I recommend this to everyone who can afford it.","5","2015-07"
"Amazing hotel but overpriced high tea","My husband and I visited the hotel for an ""ultimate"" high tea. The building itself is worth a visit, however, there is very little of the inside of the hotel that non residents are permitted to access. We had high tea, at a cost of approx £105 each, which was not worth the experience. The food itself was average in taste, small portions, though it was beautifully presented, with fantastic views, and a glass of champagne to accompany it. 

Overall, I have been in buildings in the Uk which were just  as grand, and had high teas which were far superior, without the eye watering price. 

It is one of those ""must do"" whilst in Dubai, but I would recommend going for the cheapest high tea option,.","4","2015-11"
"extremely disappointed","when I pay this amount of money on my honeymoon for a hotel that is known for its 6 stars service I expect to be treated as a princess. that was not the case. it was one of the worst stays i have experienced. the called ""private butler"" was my master, he was very rude, he didn't help me unpack although i was arriving from another journey which was exhausting, he didn't provide me with hangers and other things i asked him for until i had to call the main office downstairs to complain. that was an example for the bad experience. 
I was very disappointed in fact i told all my friends not to waste their money for a nice mattress and a view only when i can have it with a better service in another hotel.","1","2014-12"
"A fantastic treat ","As a special treat we did high tea here, we booked far in advance and everything was very smooth. We drove there and used the complementary valet parking. Even the drive up the private drive way is impressive and as soon as you step through the doors the decoration, the aquariums, the fountains all take your breathe away. We sat down at 1 and the afternoon tea lasted about 2 hours. I agree with other reviews that the food offered isn't what makes this hotel stand out (it was of a similar quality as a smaller outlet) but there is plenty of food and anything you can't finish can be taken home with you. We were fortunate to have a fantastic table by the window (I think it helps to come early as all the window seats were occupied first and then the tables towards the back). The staff really did everything to make our afternoon enjoyable. If you have the chance enjoy this once in a life time experience. ","5","2015-11"
"Opulent experience","Booked High tea to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. We were given Burj chocolates, a rose, a pen and a little cake to recognise this. All nice touches which were appreciated. Most people there were celebrating something, and although quite formal it was friendly and easy going.
The hotel is luxurious and opulent, and of course very expensive, as was the high tea.
Overall the experience of high tea was memorable, more because of the location, view and excellent customer service, rather than the actual tea. 

The high tea (in our opinion) was a little disappointing. We felt it lacked variety and imagination compared to others we had been to. We gave feedback to the hotel who were appreciative of this. 
A wonderful Dubai experience.","5","2015-08"
"A little ostentatious - but only to be expected !","Table for four for drinks on a Friday night (Dubai's Saturday) proved to be a pretty nice experience, albeit pricey (but only to be expected).  Certainly a tick on the bucket list.  Cocktails very nice - and good reccommendations from the server, complete with complimentary snacks and golf ball sized olives !","5","2015-11"
"Dinner and afternoon tea at burj al arab","Amazing restaurant, both of them, al mahara and skyline. The service is excellent, they all treat you so nice, the food is really tasty, the six course dinner menu is delicious!! The place is pure luxury, they make you feel like a princess. The price is really expensive, but these are the things you deserve to live at least once in a lifetime, you won't regret it.","5","2015-11"
"High Tea","I was warned by friends that High Tea at the Sky View Bar was expensive and it was VERY expensive but worth every dirham.  The hotel foyer is amazing and the restaurant where the High Tea is served provides a spectacular view over Dubai.  The food is fabulous and the staff were very helpful, friendly and professional and were happy to accommodate my dietary requirements.  Go for the 4pm sitting and stay for the sunset and the lights of Dubai.  A unique experience.  I booked through the hotel website.","5","2015-10"
"Never disappoints","We have been lucky enough to stay several times here and never get bored or tired of it.  It is fabulous.  The staff cannot do enough for you.  The place is immaculate, so clean and attention to detail is paramount.  I wish people that only visit for tea or drinks would not post negative reviews, they are not getting the full picture.  Maybe these reviews should only be for people who have stayed at the hotel and the restaurants placed elsewhere.  I would recommend anybody stay here.","5","2015-10"
"In the lap of luxury!","Our stay at the famed Burj Al Arab was very enjoyable and for guests who like to be fussed over, you're assigned a personal valet who helps you get things done in the hotel and also organizes the resources for your interests in the city.

Check-in was smooth, in the room itself and assisted by the guest relations service team. The Sky Bar is fantastic and well worth the dollars you will be spending there. You will need to reserve in advance as it is very popular with the hotel guests as well as visitors.

Al-Mahara Sea Food restaurant is quite an experience and again well worth the money. Not cheap, we spend close to US $ 1000 on dinner for 2 people, but the food was great and the service and attention was fantastic. Breakfast was again a multi-cuisine lavish spread and has something for everyone.

There are things to do around the hotel at its private beach. 

The decor of the room we stayed in was top notch and all conceivable amenities were available including  toiletries from Hermes for men and Kelly for the fairer sex. Views across the sea were exceptional.

We loved our stay and will stay again in the future.","5","2014-12"
"Impressive ","I've just returned from a 4 night stay at the Burj for my wife's birthday and had an excellent time. We stayed in a suite which was fantastic whilst the compliments far exceeded anything else I'd experienced, the staff including private butler were all first class

The price of beverages were certainly not excessive by Dubai standards ","5","2015-11"
"Afternoon Tea","We booked into this amazing hotel for Afternoon Tea, it was a magical experience, the views were amazing. Service from the staff was top class, the most beautiful hotel in the world. From the moment we entered we were treated like royalty. 
Highly recommend afternoon tea for a special occasion. ","5","2014-12"
"Understandably a 7 star hotel!!","We visited the Burj Al Arab famous Sky Bar, located parallel the building on the 20 odd floor. I took my girlfriend there for birthday drinks, and we where not disappointed!

I prebooked the table at home in the UK, via email, which was incredibly easy. The response time was very quick and professional. There was a minimum spend of £60 per head, however being in a 7 star hotel's bar, I felt this wouldnt be a difficult task to spend!

The staff, the drinks and presentation of the bar was incredible. I would recommend a visit here, they have a great panoramic view of Dubai and the Palm, which, at night looked like something out of a movie!

We walked around the hotel lobby and enjoyed the design and style, which was breathtaking. One item we noticed, which showed that the hotel goes to all lengths to impress was a wet floor sign. Now this may sound strange but i am used to seeing a yellow plastic sign in a hotel/supermarket/work, that's a good enough warning for me, however the Burj Al Arab has a Gold one!!?? Mind - Blown! :) 
The attention to detail to the design is something special and although we didn't stay in the hotel and just visited the bar, the experience was brilliant.

Anyway, Id highly recommend a visit even if its just to see how the other half live....","5","2015-11"
"Icon of Dubai","Burj Al Arab is Icon of Dubai .
colour and designing of Burj al Arab is superb .
its situated on jumeriah beach ... main attraction of Dubai ...
the tourist must came here to see the man creation on earth ...","5","2015-10"
"most luxurious hotel in the world","Having stayed at all the other jumeirah properties in dubai in the past my wife and i decided to stay at burj al arab for 3 nights in november.They call themselves the most luxurious hotel in the world which could be true as far as the suite is concerned.It was extremely beautiful and doesnt look outdated and had the most comfortable bed.bathroom was very good,hermes products toiletries are a good gimmick,butler service was good,
Hotel is good if you want to relax in the hotel and use the indoor pool and gym which were excellent.
If you want to shop and use the beach and pools then JBH makes more sense.Burj al arab is not for kids and we did not see many kids.Breakfast was excellent but room service was average..food is not a plus point unlike jbh or madinat jumeriah.
Our stay was excellent...we paid full price and it was worth it,however i would stay here again if i get a big discount in summer.I would try the panoramic suite next time
it is a great hotel,give it a try .","4","2015-11"
"Expensive but worth the experience!","We stayed only one night in this hotel to celebrate our anniversary. We were in Dubai for 10 days and stayed in 2 other Jumeirah properties. 
This hotel is extremely expensive but worth a visit just for the experience alone. The service is beyond top notch- our butler arranged for a surprise reveal to my husband that we are expecting a baby girl. It was seamless. 
The rooms are fabulous and ornate. The unobstructed views of the ocean are indescribable. 
My only complaint is the seafood restaurant. It truly was one of the most expensive and disappointing meals I have ever had in my life- $600 U.S. Dollars. The sea bass was dry and flavorless. My husband did not like his scallops either. The fish soup needed salt. In fact salt was lacking in all of the dishes. We emptied our salt shaker on the food. The meal and price left a sour taste in our mouths, literally. 
The food at the other restaurants was good. 
Again, worth a visit just for the experience.","5","2015-10"
"Friday brunch on 27 th floor simply divine","The burj al arab for friday brunch is simply amazing. 7 star hotel with an overwheming  entrance reaches the pinnacle when you arrive on 27 th floor with outstanding views of the palm jumeriah, the world, the boats in the sea and the coastline.  All this before you start brunch....!!! The staff are very professional and cater for your every whim.. Yes expensive at 675 dhms approx £121 but worth it for a special treat. The variety and quality of the food is outstanding. Approx 100 starters i.e. Lobster,crab,mussels,salmon,oysters,etc etc. Main courses too many to mention, but suit all tastes. Deserts well......indulge....again too many to mention. Free water and soft drinks, alcohol extra. Wonderful experience that i shall never forget. They are in the process of building an island at the base around the pool.","5","2015-11"
"Bucket List","This is a Grand Hotel.    We stayed for one night . Our suite  was very big , lots of space, lots of colour , bathroom was nice with a large bath for a nice relaxing soak ,  we found the hotel and restaurants a bit pricey ,the hotel could do with a bit of a revamp.","3","2015-06"
"Over rated","We visited in September as a party of 4.  We were going for afternoon tea for two but then decided to take our partners - we went for coctails  instead so we could all enjoy the experience.  
The inside is lovely but we were ushered in a lift to the top floor taken to a table - and as it was night time we could see nothing as the windows slope.  All you can see is the reflection from the lights inside.
Cocktails were £35.00 and there was a minimum spend of of 1300  derams per table plus £70.00 each to go inside the hotel.
Very expensive for a 2 hour experience.","3","2015-09"
"Sumptuous Excess!","Our Oceania Cruise from Istanbul terminated in Dubai, a place of many excesses. The Burj Al Arab hotel, with aquariums lining the walls next to the escalators on either side of the tiered fountains leading up to the lobby, is maybe the excessive of all. Shaped like the sail of a dhow boat endemic to the region, it is stunning inside and out. Of course, we didn't stay here, but we heard there are some rooms that go for $18,000 a night. Why? Don't ask me. 

What we DID do, was go to Tea, in a special room arranged by Oceania. You can go to Tea on your own at the very top of the hotel and the view from there is amazing. I believe the food and the service would be very similar, maybe better on your own. But what we had was stellar. Scones and clotted cream, of course, and little sandwiches and then sweets/pastries. The place raised our blood pressure and the food, our blood sugar! Some pics attached.","5","2015-10"
"high tea","enjoyed high tea at hotel.  A place to say you have been but a bit over the top with staff constantly asking if food was ok.  It was a bit intrusive.  Paid on credit card and was charged five times.  emailed hotel when home and they did sort if out but not something you would expect from this hotel","4","2015-09"
"7 star luxury!","Believe the hype this place is magnificent!

We were already booked for our Dubai holiday staying at our favourite Jumeirah Beach Hotel when we saw the Billion Dollar Hotel TV programme and on a whim, having secretly wanted to for many years, changed our first night's stay to the Burj Al Arab. 

Using TA as a guide we booked a panoramic suite and also the Culinary Flight (please see separate review) and also arranged for one of their white Rolls Royce Phantoms to pick us up from the airport. 

From the moment we sat in those plush leather seats in the RR at just after 8:30 in the morning until we checked out (they were great and gave us a late check out) at 3 pm the next afternoon we were made to feel like royalty. The facilities are literally out of this world but what sets it apart is the service you receive from absolutely everyone you meet. 

Special mention must be made for our Butlers - Sam, Katharina and Tony - who were fantastic looking after us on the 7th floor, nothing was too much trouble, even the slight mark on my wife's dress was cleared up by dry cleaning, given to them at 1 am and back in the room by 8 am. 

Our recommendations:

1. Arrive in style, book a transfer with one of their cars in advance. Very easy to arrange and means you breeze through the security and the welcoming team are there to greet you. 
2. Make sure you inform the hotel of any special occasion you are celebrating. The staff go out of their way to help you celebrate - lost count of the number of times we were wished a happy anniversary and the cake and all the flowers lasted us all week!
3. Do the Culinary flight for your evening meal. It enables you to experience all the wonderful restaurants the hotel had to offer. 
4. Take your gym and swimming kit. I can assure you that the Talise Health Club and Spa is the best gym and pool you will ever visit. Never busy, the infinity pool on the 18th floor allows you to test and reflect on what you are experiencing. 
5. Allow a little extra room in your luggage for all the Hermes toiletries you can take away with you. All full sized I counted 13 different bottles/packages!

A very special stay and will do it again once the budget allows. ","5","2015-10"
"Amazing, but a heads up.","The first thing to get out of the way is to say that you really need to check prices a couple times after you book.  I booked two months before my stay and never checked again and the price was a third less the day I was there.  I read where Dubai hotel rates could change daily, but I really didn't give it much thought till I got there and by that time it was too late.  The other thing is that the service charges and taxes are 20% on top of the very high room rates.

The rooms are all two stories tall.  The hotel is only 27 floors, but equivalent to like 60 floors.  I was on the 10th floor and it felt like 30 floors up.  

The views from the rooms are amazing.  The hotel is way over done, but that is kind of the fun of it.  You have a private butler on every floor to see to your needs.  They have a very nice spa and fitness center and several nice restaurants.

The 27th floor has a restaurant and sky bar.  If you are going to have dinner at night, then make sure to ask for a table on the sides facing the city.  The view facing the water has no light and you end up with no view.  We were going to leave, but a very nice manager walked up and told us that if we could just be patient, there was a couple about ready to leave and they did and we had a very nice table with a view.

The breakfast was exceptional in their main restaurant as was the food on the 27th floor.

It was disappointing that their pool and pool bar were closed for remodel while we were there.  However, Jumeriah has hotels up and down the beach for about a mile and you are a welcome guest at any of these hotels sister properties.  It's very easy to run or walk up and down the beach on a nice wide walkway.

The hotel is iconic and very special.  If you can get a decent price or money doesn't matter, you should stay at least a night or two.","4","2015-11"
"Sky lounge","Over priced and a disappointment. Some poorly presented cocktails, in my opinion. No wow factor for a 7* hotel in this bar. At night be sure to get the right table to enjoy the spectacular city view otherwise you look out on complete darkness. Sorry just didn't live up to my expectations! ","2","2015-11"
"Afternoon Tea","The whole Burj Al Arab experience is something else! We booked for afternoon tea and were not disappointed. The cakes, pastries and sandwiches were to die and the service impeccable . There was the added bonus of a hot course consisting of steak and potato! ","5","2015-03"
"Rude and unpleasent","I must say I was reading some of the reviews and I could not agree more with some of the comments being written. It was my friends birthday i flew in from london to treat him to a good lavish evening. I decided to take him to the burj al arab as it is a 7 star hotel. We got to the gates and the security guard (edward) clicks his fingers and calls us like you would call a pet. For a 7 star hotel to have something like that before u even walk in I could not beleive it. If that gentlemen works in hospitality i would not want to know what kind of experience it would be further inside the hotel. He ruined our mood straightaway we did not bother going in due to how we was treated and ended up going to the jumeirah beach hotel which was absolutely amazing the hotel that should be 7 star is 5 and the hotel that should not have a star is 7 shocking.","1","2015-11"
"High tea at The Lobby Restaurant","Decided to treat ourselves to High Tea at the hotel, obviously the only way to gain entry is to book something, and this is what I chose. Cost was high, obviously, but the experience was worth it.
Reading other reviews, I imagined we would be rushed out after eating and made to feel we should not linger- nothing could have been further from the truth! We arrived half an hour before 7.30 reservation, and left about 10.pm. Sandwiches, pastries, and scones, plus a couple of great drinks were included. To be honest, the food was better at Claridges in London which we visited a couple of years ago, for similar experience, but this was not the end of the world! 
We got to experience beautiful surroundings, a great and filling meal, were well looked after, overall - go for it!","4","2015-10"
"Not a 7 star hotel","This hotel is just over rated....employees are not well trained...they put lots of signs that you cant take photos but the hotel staff are not implementing their own rules...i was supposed to eat in the restaurant in the ground mezzanine but i felt that the chinese manager was rude so i just left and decided to take a drink overlooking the water park...the hotel certainly doesnt have the exclusivity.","3","2015-10"
"New Year's Eve !!!","Make sure you get early to the mall in order to be able to park your car, and get through the crowd! Past 11pm the roads are blocked from traffic and people are just stopping on a highway and watch the light show ! If you plan to visit the burj and climb then I suggest you make your reservations in advance , sometimes there is no available spots and you will end up paying double if not more of the access price.","5","2014-12"
"One of the worst hotel experiences","Was looking forward to the stay and the experience for several years. However left unimpressed, disappointed and wishing we'd never bothered to accept their hospitality.
Check in was rude, food was substandard for a hotel of this level, shower plumbing flooded and the guaranteed ""high level"" suite was on the second floor.
Plenty of other choices in the area within which we've had far better experiences. ","1","2014-11"
"Extremely expensive","The only way to get inside without paying for a room is to book a table at one of the hotel's costly eateries. Al Muntaha is on the top floor but its bafflingly bright interior prevents you from seeing the views outside","4","2015-09"
"Queen For A Day!!!!!!!!!!","I was treated to High Tea in the Skyview Bar by my husband. What an over the top experience. From the minute you walk into the property you are treated like royalty.
The hotel is just spectacular--it is worth the price of the tea just to see it.
You are whisked to the top floor (Skyview Bar) in a private elevator with a glass side, which allows you to see the fantastic view as you ascend to the top of the hotel.
You are greeted by name by all hotel personnel ( very impressive). The Skyview Bar is gorgeous  and the tea set up is very elegant. The food and service of the 7 course High Tea menu was quite impressive and the view overlooking Dubai was breathtaking.
Yes, it is quite expensive--but it is an experience of a life time and worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!","5","2015-10"
"High tea","It was a lovely afternoon.  Expect to stay for two hours.
Yes it is expensive but was an experience.  Drinks are very costly.
You are treated well and suggest you get there early as it is first come best dressed.  We had the window seat to the right one back from the pillar and this was a great view.
The waiters were very nice and polite.","5","2015-10"
"Must have the 7 stars hidden under the rug","To enter the hotel you must consume about $100 per person if you want to go to the suspended bar. We wanted to see it so we decided to pay,  anyways everything in Dubai is crazy expensive. The interior has the worst taste I have ever seen and did not feel like lavish luxury that you would expect from a ""7 star hotel"" the only thing that catches your eye is the aquarium at the entrance. Once you go into the bar it feels almost like a cheap cruise line bar.. Just save your money and take a picture from the outside is the nicest view.","1",
"Afternoon Tea...just fantastic","Treated my wife and I to a superb Afternoon Tea. Yes, it's way over the top expensive but for us it was well worth it just to see how the other half live. The setting, the views, the staff and the food were all superb and, despite the price, I would highly recommend the Burj Al Arab","5","2015-10"
"Had An Awesome Time With Kids At Jumeira Beach Hotel Dubai","Everything in Dubai is king size and this beach resort only surprised me by tons. The service is excellent and the desk assistance too is noteworthy. In addition, the buffets are well stocked and perfectly organized at the hotel. What caught my attention was that the beach area was so clean despite being overcrowded most of the times.  And my kids fell in love with the water park. We also hitched a camel ride and perhaps that was the stellar attraction of the day. Make sure you check out Wild Wadi—right next to the Jumeira Beach hotel too.","5","2015-05"
"Unbeatable !","My 3 night stay in The Burj with my wife was a fantastic experience. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. Our room was exceptionally appointed. The attention to detail was like nothing else we have experienced anywhere else in the world. Not only is the hotel an unbelievably beautiful building the customer service is second to none. When a hotel calls themself The Most Luxurious Hotel in The World, the expectation is very high. I can personally assure you that The Burj al Arab definitely lives up to this billing. It exceeded our expectation. Thank You !","5","2015-10"
"Luxury Hotel!","Beautiful and luxurious hotel , right on the beach with amazing views of the sea, Atlantis The Palms and Palm Jumeirah. The hotel is known for its luxury and the staff certainly ensures the same level is maintained everywhere. Entry without a prior booking is not possible so make sure you have a booking already - either for rooms or restaurant. 
We had gone there for High Tea, which is an experience in itself.
Must visit atleast once, if only to experience the luxury.","5","2014-11"
"Superlative !!!","We had a ring ceremony of friend's son hosted in the ball room of this coveted location.  It was majestic to have two level Ball room. 

Good vegetarian food was served. Interior was truly regal and outstanding , no wonder it has become iconic on world map. 

Everything was superb !!!","5","2014-11"
"Deserves the 7* rating","This was my 6th trip to Dubai but the first for my wife.  She hadn't shown much interest in Dubai so if I was going to take here there for a surprise honeymoon, I needed to do it right so I decided Burj Al Arab was the only way to do it.  Virtually everyone I knew advised against it, one person describing the hotel as Colonel Gaddafi's Palace.  All I can say is - how wrong you all were!

We arrived at Dubai airport to the hotel's premier meet & greet service where we were taken to a VIP lounge and served with food and drinks.  My wife, who had no idea where we were staying, wondered what it was all about.  I lied and said that the hotel said they would look after her as they knew she was pregnant.  I am not sure that she bought it but she said ""That is so nice of them"" all the same.  

Whilst we were enjoying the refreshments, our luggage was collected for us and we were then whisked straight through security to 'get a taxi'.  As we walked outside, my wife was shown to a white Rolls Royce and given a bunch of flowers.  She looked at me and said ""We aren't staying at the Burj Al Arab are we?""  I smiled.  ""Oh my GOD! I never thought we would be going there!!"" she said.  Job done!

If you have never been in a Rolls Royce, please try it if only to feel the quality of the carpet in the back.  Quite a remarkable car.

Arriving at the hotel is an event.  We were met by a team of 3 people. Cold towels, cold drinks, more flowers for my wife and despite it being only 8.30am, we were taken straight to our suite for check in and a tour of the room.

We stayed in the smallest duplex suite (small at 170 square metres) on the 19th floor.  Seriously - where do I start? The decor is somewhat bright; all royal blues, reds and golds, but you know something? It works perfectly!  This is Dubai and when you stay at Burj Al Arab, they want you to live like royalty.  Whenever we left our room there was no less than two butlers outside our door ready to cater for every whim and my wife was totally spoiled.  Every day of our stay, she was brought gifts of flowers, fresh fruit, drinks, cakes and hotel management came by twice to ask if my wife was comfortable and if there was anything they could do to make her stay more pleasurable.  We were too embarrassed to ask for anything else, they had already done so much.

Free Hermes toiletries in the bathroom and free Hermes aftershave and perfume for us to take home (not miniatures either).

As you would expect, mini bar is preposterously expensive (£25 for a packet of crisps) so when my wife was peckish, I said to order something from the room service rather than pay that much for crisps.  She ended up choosing french fries and a couple of bread rolls with butter.  And that cost £36.  Club Sandwich by the pool? £44.  By the end of the trip though, everything is just so perfect that you are beyond caring.  ""£15 for a smoothie? That's pretty cheap actually..."" Honestly, that is what we were saying in the end.

We ate breakfast in the buffet each day.  As you would expect, it is the best buffet ever.  We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as we were always out shopping so ate out.  

Trained in the gym - very good with amazing views.  Wife has a special pregnancy massage and said it was the finest massage she had ever received. Also probably the most expensive.

The Burj Al Arab is a truly spectacular hotel.  The staff make you feel like royalty and manage to balance things perfectly with always being on hand to serve you but without being intrusive. Yes it is extremely expensive but you can't go there expecting anything different.  And after the initial shock of the prices, you just stop worrying because it is actually worth every penny and then some.

I said the trip was a once in a lifetime thing but looking back, I can't not stay there again so will wait for a special occasion and book another stay. 

Once thing I still haven't worked out though was how every single person in the hotel knew our name.  On the last day, we were just going down in the lift to leave and an Arab gentleman got in on another floor.  As we got out the lift he said to me ""Have a safe trip Mr and Mrs Cooper, thank you for staying at our hotel"" and we were like ""How do they do that???!!!""

Whatever they do and however they do it doesn't really matter.  All you need to know is that they do things better than anyone else.  Forget any of the negative reviews, I have stayed at top hotels all over the world including Shangri La, One & Only, Four Seasons etc and nothing comes remotely close.","5","2015-06"
"Probably deserved the '7 star' ratings ...Excellence is an understatement!","This is my second time around at this wonderful hotel and I had to come back as I didn't spend 
enough time here to be able to fully experience what this hotel had to offer. Having been to so many 5 star hotels around the world, Burj Alarab is definitely the most superior and luxurious .   If you want a romantic holiday either for family or as a couple .. This hotel is it!
Having been picked up at the airport with with a gleaming white Rolls Royce from the airport , your expectation level of hotel couldn't be higher.
Check in was smooth and so was my butler(neil). The suite was luxuriously furnished with Hermes toiletries.  The hotel is quite far from the city centre in my opinion but there's a wonderful beach which a buggy from the hotel will take you around because of the heat.  It's not cheap and definitely not for the faint hearted.
There are so many top notch restaurant within the hotel and even within the surrounding hotels.  Staff are pleasant especially the chefs at the restaurant that can offer you food that's not in the menu( I asked twice ).  Guest have the use of the water park next door called wild wadi.  I'd recommend for honeymooners as they don't even have to leave the hotel or its surrounding.
Definitely money well spent. Truly awesome hotel! ","5","2015-10"
"While highly expensive, an incredible experience","We stayed one night in Burj al arab. Actually more like 10 hours. So the real question should be, does the luxury stand up? Definitely. Everything in Burj al Arab is by precision and their service is exquisite.
It was an unforgettable experience. It will burn a hole in your pocket, but I believe it was worth it, if you are of course a made woman/man","5","2014-11"
"Luxury","Well everything is done with the utmost precision.  Its what you would expect.  I'm not a great fan of Dubai but this hotel takes you to another place.  Is it worth the expense?  Well if I was paying myself I probably wouldn't stay there but the client insisted because of the good security.  I certainly appreciated it and enjoyed my time here when I was able to relax.  Its glamour, luxury, great visual experience, amazing food and nice hospitality.","4","2014-11"
"Oh. My. Goodness!!!!","I stayed at this amazing hotel in September 2014 during a 2 week holiday in Dubai. I only stayed for one night due to the cost but it was worth it. Every floor has its own butler, who will draw you a bath!!! Such luxury!! On entering our room (apartment would be a more approrpriate word) the oppulence, craftsmanship and luxury was immediately apparent. Deep, soft carpet, fresh fruit and wine waiting for you and a tour given by staff. There's a marble staircase that leads to 2 stunning rooms, with even more impressive bathrooms! Luxury bath and beauty products and perfume that I'm still using over a year later!! I cannot fault the Burj Al Arab at all. I would go back, given the chance. One night is not enough to get the most of what this hotel has to offer. I also had the high tea, which I also couldn't fault. Despite the cost, it was well worth it.  ","5","2014-11"
"Endless stars","A hotel of ""Mille et une nuit"" for non residencers you need to make a reservation in one of the restaurants for lunch or dinner in order to pass the entrance security.Whe have been several times  to the fish restaurant artificialy under the see level the food is realy good buth verry expensive however it was a unforgetable experience if your budget permits do it !.The lobby of the hotel is faboulous especialy the aquarium.A dream buth not for everybody .","5","2015-03"
"Once In A Lifetime Experience","If Luxury is your drug than this is the hotel of your choice. Brilliant Staff & Hospitality. It is Expensive around $4000 per night for a standard room but worth none the less. Private Beach, being transported in a Rolls Royce, Infinity Pool and state of the art gym facilities. Don't miss the chance to stay in a 7 star hotel because its something that only happens once in a lifetime.","5","2015-09"
"I got an experience way more valuable than what I was expecting.","Prices are high, but once you go in there, this is a place where you will find security, luxury, service, space, elegance, and privacy. Each room has 2 floors (it's a complte apartment) with spectacular views. It has an iMac, wine bar, guest bathroom, and more. The hotel has stores, a great gym, a spectacular breakfast buffet and a very nice bar at the top of the building. It's said to be the tallest all suite hotel in the world and you can see this from the lobby looking up into the sky. Well worth every dollar.","5","2015-05"
"Expensive, but value nonetheless","Location, staff and service would be difficult to better. Seven courses including the champagne at the start and the chocolates gift at the end. (The other courses from memory were a strawberry pannacota type dessert (served at the start), a duck confit and foie gras individual pie, sandwiches, sorbet, and an assortment of cakes and scones). There was a huge quantity of the latter in particular which our party could not finish. There are large selections of teas and coffees and the staff are always on hand but not in an intrusive way to enquire if you need more. A previous poster has suggested don't eat breakfast, certainly if you go at the time we went which was 4pm, don't plan to have dinner. A special treat indeed.","5","2015-10"
"A Little Underwhelming.","On first impressions - from the outside, this hotel is nothing short of beautiful. Can be seen from afar in Dubai and if you're visiting Dubai, you NEED to visit - just to say you've been. We made a reservation at the SkyView Bar. There is a minimum spend of 350AED per person, which I was informed about when making the reservation and the drinks are quite expensive but we did get our moneys worth - but they weren't anything special. The complimentary snacks provided aren't great, quite fish based and olives and if you don't like either of those then you need to go without. The best thing about this 7 star hotel, is the 7 star service. The staff were friendly, welcoming and extremely attentive to visitors. We did ask when booking for a window table but as you can imagine, everyone wants a window table - we were moved twice closer to the window before being given a window table - the view itself is quite good, even in the evening.","3","2015-10"
"Expect wayyyy more.","Seven stars will be an understatement, this place is luxury, elegance, awesomeness to the max. Felt like king for a couple of days. Their service is perfect, never had a chance to wait for something. Mornings after I hit the gym I will have ready my cold smoothie in my suite with some fresh fruit. Breakfast buffet is spectacular and with many things to choose from. Architecture is a masterpiece and yes, inside the atrium of the hotel you can fit the statue of liberty..... it is huge!!!! Tallest all suite hotel in the world. Spa is on the top with a view over jumeirah beach. Restaurant and bar look over the see. Best sunset I've seen in years.","5","2015-07"
"The most special hotel in the world.","When you stay at the Burj you are treated like their first or last ever customer and everyone will do whatever they can to make your stay special. Yes the hotel literally blows your mind everywhere you look with its gold leaf decor or fountains in the lobby that shoots water miles in the air but it's the little things that make this hotel special. 

When you arrive you are greater by an army of people welcoming you all with a huge smile as if you are long lost friends. 

The butlers on your floor make sure every element of your stay flawless and will do anything in their power for you including bringing a cocktail to your room pre-dinner.

Breakfast is a wide choice of various offerings from arabic to chinese to british dishes. there is a choice of fillet steak to which was our favorite.

Pool - this was our only tiny disappointment but fully understood that it is currently closed for refurbishment however having to share the pool with the JBH was not great as it was very busy / loud and not really what you expect when staying at the Burj.

Overall this place is magical and worth every penny staying here. We will be returning next year to see what the new pool is like and also the private beach that is being constructed. 

Thank you BAA","5","2015-09"
"A fabulous experience","Everyone needs to experience this wonderful hotel at least once in their lifetime. Stunning views inside and out! The staff are very attentive and nothing is too much trouble. The Talise spa treatments are worth every penny. You are allowed to just take your time to enjoy the facilities without being rushed. What a wonderful experience.","5","2015-09"
"Sky view afternoon tea","We had afternoon tea at the Burj on the 26th September. From the moment we entered we were greeted and made to feel very welcome. It certainly has the WOW factor, and we would like to thank all the staff for such an unforgettable experience. Anybody visiting Dubai should visit the Burj and have afternoon tea.
p.s. Do not have breakfast before you go.","5","2015-09"
"Culinary Flight - Seven Restaurants in on evening.","Did the culinary flight for our 10th Anniversary. Not the sort of thing you do every day but worth every penny. Personal service at each of seven restaurants we visited during the course of the evening. Each time we finished at one we were personally escorted to the next and introduced to the next person to look after us. Great!","5",
"One of the most visited places in Dubai!","One of the most visited places in Dubai! It is a must if you visit Dubai! Very nice view and you will certainly get nice photos! When the weather is good (most of the year in Emirates) then you will enjoy swimming in the crystal water sea! Very nice sandy beach also!","4","2015-06"
"Super","Simple - the BEST !!!! Amazing amazing amazing ... that's it end of story. Stayed in the suite and it was a truly beautiful experience. staff were just amazing and the food was delicious cannot thank everyone enough","5","2015-09"
"Afternoon tea at Skyview bar","On Thursday 1st October my partner and I visited the Burj al Arab for afternoon tea at the skyview bar for my birthday. It was a simply amazing experience. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially our server Zen. The food was delicious and the views outstanding. A must visit whilst holiday img in Dubai!","5","2015-10"
"It was an Amazing Lunch for my 10th Year Wedding Anniversary","I have been visiting Dubai but has never entered the Burj Al Arab.
My first encounter with the Hotel will live with me and my wife for the rest of our lives.

My intention was to give my lovely wife a surprise treat, but I received much more than I bargained for.  I was totally surprised at the end of the day.

I received the treatment of a King and my wife was more than a Queen.

You just have to visit there yourself as my expression is only a tip of the iceberg","5","2015-09"
"What an experience!!!","For being the only 7 star hotel in the world... this place really was an amazing experience.  Stayed here for 3 nights- all the rooms are two floor suites with absolutely stunning decor and views.  Every guest had their own butler who was accommodating with everything and more.....  The lobby of the hotel was stunning, the restaurants, and all the attractions nearby were absolutely incredible!  Had a very lovely experience here.","5","2014-11"
"Amazing Afternoon SkyTea for mums Birthday","Amazing! Our waiter was so lovley, I wish we could do  it all over again! Just perfect!
I brought this for my mums birthday, and she absolutly loved it, I would recommend it to everyone. All the staff were very friendly, and the place itself is out of this world.","5","2015-09"
"One of the best vacations","That was my first time in this hotel. I did not have many expectations prior going there. We had a panoramic suite which was incredible and quite a wow factor. Room was bigger than most apartments in London or Paris. Voss water served with some other complementaries.
It's meant to be a 7 star hotel ... well ... on certain parts I'd agree to that, on some I would not. As said by many people before, they have Hermes toiletries but no cotton buds nor mouthwash. Just bizarre :)
Service is excellent, we had a small incident with ""miscommunication"" but apologies and compensation was offered. Our butler was just brilliant !!! He was the gem of the hotel.
Overall I would personally give it around 6 stars. I would go back anytime !","5","2015-10"
"Wonderful birthday afternoon tea","My daughter booked afternoon tea for us both for my birthday at this amazing hotel. From the arrival at the gate with the really friendly and funny security guard to the time we left was the most amazing experience we have had together for a long time. We loved every aspect of it and lost count how many times we said WOW. We will definitely loved to return again next time we are in Dubai for another taste of pure  luxury . Thank you ","5","2015-10"
"We enjoyed excellent service and to be pampered","With your reservation to Sky View Bar, you are into an excellent treat.
You are expected, elevator is beeing opened for you, you are meet by the door and your table is ready.
The decor in this bar overlooking wonderfull Dubai, serves the most delighted drinks, expensive - right, but it is worth it.","5","2015-09"
"Skyview Bar Afternoon Tea - Burj Al Arab","We were given a voucher for the Burj Al Arab for our engagement... and afternoon tea was recommended.

We had an amazing and truly unforgettable experience. From the glass of champagne on arrival, to the complimentary leaving gifts, every detail was thought of and executed to the highest of standards.

It was also my birthday so they even bought out a small cake, and gave my fiancé a rose to give me for our engagement.

 I would highly recommend the Burj Al Arab for any and every special occasion.","5","2015-10"
"Honeymoon","Amazing! We had dinner in Al Muntaha restaurant on the 27th floor. It was a wonderful experience enjoyed every minute. The food was unreal. Large quantity and tasted super good. The staff were more than welcoming and explained the menu to us in detail. The wine was delicious also..","5","2015-09"
"Hi Tea far lower than our great expectations","Sadly, our high expectations were met with great disillusion and shock.
Flat French champagne from yesterday's service, dry sandwiches, tea bags! and suburban pastries left refridgerated for so long they were tacky and damp to touch. In a word inedible.
At close to Aust. $300.00 per head we were expecting 'an experience', the equal to High Tea at Claridges or the Ritz, however, the actual experience was one of the greatest tourist rip-offs we have encountered in all our travels.
The service was charming and professional but the five star pastry chefs could only muster a zero star performance on the day. Don't bother, you can get a similar view from a number of other places in Dubai and the Hi Tea is the worst in the world!","1","2015-09"
"MY DREAM SEVEN STAR LUXURIOUS HOTEL","A truly world class hotel my dream cum true.from my check in to check out i received a king's hospitality by the staff and a king size breakfast and fabulous  suit room u cannot ask for any more .i regret that i stayed for only one night Near future planning for a longer stay during off season to experience the spectacular of this hotel to the fullest .i wud like to thank the floor in charge mr REHAN  and the butler mr SEKAR and the  chef de cuisine mr.HUSSAIN DAGHER","4","2015-09"
"INDESCRIBABLE","If there was a higher rating available i would give it unfortunately there is only five this truly is a seven star hotel in every way. This is where we ended our honeymoon and what a place to have ended it this palace is nothing short of excellent. We stayed in the panoramic suit for four nights witch was not enough time the bed was like a silk cloud that was made up for you twice a day. The staff were magical so adentive from the bottom to the top. On every floor there was a 24 hour reception desk with butler service we stayed in room 1112. Our butlers names were Abdullah and Paul they were both amazing we did not have to lift a finger it was a real royal class service. Paul was particularly outstanding the attention he lavished upon us was incredible he offered to pack our bags for when we were leaving. There was a gift on our pillow every night and some chocolate, cakes, canapes and wine or champagne and clothes that you had left on the floor were neatly folded and put on a chair when they cleaned your room. if you were ever thinking of going stop thinking and just go because i am the type of person that is very hard to impress and The Burj surpassed all my expectations and beyond. What i did not mention was the first part of our honeymoon was three nights in Abu dhabi Emirates Palace considered to be a seven star and seven nights in the The Residence Maldives considered to be a six star The Burj Al Arab blew them out of the water.","5","2015-09"
"Classed as the Billion Pound Hotel and it certainly lived up to the name.","Where should I start, we spent 3 nights, four days, and it was sheer luxury, I woke up every morning with a smile on my face as I looked over the Palms from the 20th floor.
From the moment we entered the lounge at the airport, then into the Rolls Royce we were treated like royality.  Once at the hotel we were taken staight to our Suite and were introduced to our Butler, Marlon, who made sure we had everything we needed.
Later in the day we met our other Butlers Shakeel Ahmad, and Sanju, and between them they made sure our stay was 110%, infact it was 1000%.  The suite was out of this world and had everything you could want. Bedding was changed every night, so were the tolietries.   Shakeel was such a gentleman and nothing was too much trouble, he sliced our fruit up every evening, presented us with a delicious cake and beautiful roses to celebrate our 40th Wedding Annv..  We ate at the Al Iwan Resturant every morning and evening and the choice of food is out of this world.  All the staff greeted us by name and were very attentive. The talented Chefs cooked us delicious food and personally came and spoke to us.The infinity pools on the 18th
 floor gave great views. I can go on and on, but will not, hopefully you have the got the message.  Both my husband and I agree what makes this incrediable hotel 
1st class and the best in the world is the wonderful, lovely, charming, kind, caring staff namely Shakeel,Sanyu, Marlon our Butlers,, Nasir Team Leader, Mohamed the 
Chef, Tracey Mu, if fact all the Staff who treated us like Royality.  A BIG THANK YOU.
Our send off was heart felt, as they all stood there waving us off as we left in the Rolls Royce, even Valentine the person who brought down our cases..","5","2015-09"
"One of a kind service","The Burj Al Arab truly deserves a 7 star for service. We had booked a Panorama suite for our wedding anniversary. The room is very spacious (2 floors maisonette) and the view breathtaking (room 512). The butler ensures all your needs are attended to, before you even voice them. Note to self: One is not allowed to work the -golden- in suite coffee machine.. it's the butler's job.. that's why you won't find any manual anywhere! We were surprised with a lovely cake and flower petals and a hand-written note to congratulate us to our anniversary.. very nice and personal touch! One can argue about the furnishing.. a little outdated and too much gold for my liking, however the Burj is one of a kind hotel that everyone should have on their bucket list! Truly exceptional!","5","2015-09"
"SPECTRE","We stayed in a Panoramic suite for two nights in August. This was our second stay at the Burj, the first being 18 months ago. I wrote a review then that stated if I ever became the Leader of a small despotic nation, or alternatively a James Bond Villain, I would make this hotel my home / lair. Sadly (or perhaps fortunately) neither has happened. Nevertheless, we decided to spend the last two nights of our 11 day vacation to Dubai here.

We were aware that some refurbishment was taking place at the hotel (outdoor pool closed, and a couple of restaurants being updated) so we compensated by opting to stay in a Panoramic suite. Also tried to tick one more thing off the bucket list by arranging for a helicopter transfer from the Atlantis to the Burj. Unfortunately the helipad was also on the refurbishment list, so that will have to stay on the bucket list.

We were met and greeted for our early noon check-in, and our request for a high floor was accommodated by a room on the 14th floor. Last time we stayed we had a standard (if there is such a thing) suite on the 13th floor. The panoramic suites are at the front of each of the respective towers and are the reflective windows you see as you drive up to the building. Upon entering the suite, the views from the two storey floor to ceiling windows simply make your jaw drop in awe. Check-in takes place in the suite as you sit behind your office desk with imac computer. Everything about the suite is hi-tech, with remote controls for everything from the TV to the curtains to the lighting to the door cameras. We had taken the precaution of bringing our 12 year old son, so operating all of this hi-tech was simply a matter of telling him to do it!

The suite is advertised as having a greater floor area than the standard suites, but clearly the shape of the hotel causes a variation depending on the floor you are on, and I am convinced it was slightly smaller than the standard suite. Don't misunderstand me, it was huge and truly WOW! but if you are booking a standard suite you wont really be losing out on anything other than the additional spectacular view. I think the bathroom is also larger in the standard suite.

Everything in the room was fantastic, from the exquisite bed to the chairs that you sink in to. The full size his and hers Hermes products in the bathroom are still a feature, although I thought they had cut down a little on the abundance of other amenities. In any event, it made little difference. The service from all of the staff we met was professional, courteous, pre-emptive and truly first rate. We enquired if our butler from the previous stay was still working at the hotel. He was, and very kindly visited us to say ""welcome back"" and gave us a gift of three Burj mugs. Always a good sign when a hotel keeps hold of its great staff. Many thanks Paulo. 

We wanted to make maximum use of the suite on this occasion and opted for ""in-room"" dining. The service was superb, and our dining table was laid out to full restaurant quality. Truly the best room service I have ever experienced. On our last visit I was very impressed  by the abundance of quality offerings at breakfast. This time the renovations meant that the breakfast restaurant was closed, and service was divided between two of the main restaurants on the First floor. The service and food was every bit as good as our last visit, and I have no hesitation in saying it really is the best breakfast experience of any hotel I have ever visited, anywhere in the world. 

The only negative experience I had on this visit relates to the renovation works being carried out. With the outdoor pool closed, facilities had moved to the Beach club. This is across the causeway. The facilities there are excellent. Great pool, and lovely beach. We paid a brief visit to the Wild Wadi water park, and upon leaving, a security guard radioed for a buggy to take us back to the hotel. Despite numerous buggies turning up to take guests back to other hotels, a ""Burj"" one failed to arrive. After 20 minutes We gave up waiting and decide to start walking back. During the walk back (in 44c of heat) we never met a buggy coming the other way. By the time my sweaty carcass (albeit with a faint smell of Hermes) had entered the lobby, I was having a serious sense of humour failure. Having conveyed this to somebody who had (no doubt well intentionally) proffered a towel to dry off my perspiration, the complaint was later dealt with by a guest relations manager who smoothed my ruffled feathers and restored my faith in the hotel. 

In summary, the Burj is truly iconic and one of the great hotels of the world. It is a reflection of Dubai. It is dynamic, opulent, professional, (expensive), and somewhere that if you can, you really should stay at at least once. Whilst I perfect my plans for World domination with my death ray (which so far hasn't advanced beyond borrowing a compact mirror from the depths of my wife's handbag), I still plan on using this hotel as my lair from which to hold the worlds governments to ransom. I suspect my demand for one trillion dollars might barely cover incidentals and the mini-bar, so that might need some adjustment.","5","2015-08"
"The wow factor","I was here with my sister in July 2015 for afternoon tea in the sky view bar and we had an amazing experience. The staff were so friendly and as it was our birthday they bought us out a cake and a rose each, such a nice touch. Guests are also given chocolates and a pen when u leave as a keepsake. The hotel is stunning, definitely worth a visit. Food and drink was gorgeous. A bit pricey but worth every penny!!","5","2015-09"
"""Truely Luxury""","One of the best property in Dubai, live life king size is what a guest will say once entering in this hotel!!! Private beach will take your breath away which is just step away from hotel!!!
Advice to carry a swim suit as you will not able to resist once you visit the beach and see the clean blue water!!!","5","2015-08"
"If You Are Looking for Pure Indulgence, Look No Further!!!","Spent a decadent weekend celebrating our wedding anniversary at the Burj Al Arab.  Booked a Panoramic Suite.  The room was HUGE!!!  Two levels with floor to ceiling windows looking out to the sea and Dubai on land.  The first level consisted of an office area, a large dining room, living room, bar, guest toilet, and walk in closet.  Up the curved marble staircase to the second level is a massive bed, lounge area, huge dressing area, and one of the largest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen. From the bed sheets, to the towels, toiletries, and furnishings, there is no expense spared in this hotel.  You get to enjoy the finest of the finest.  Although the decor is not my taste, for some reason, it works in this hotel.  The room cost per night is steep, but you get what you pay for.  We were trying to make a cup of coffee using the gold coffee maker in the room, and the machine started beeping and wouldn't stop.  We called housekeeping to find out how to work the machine.  Moments later, the butler appeared and he politely explained that it is his job to make us a cup of coffee whenever we want it, and proceeded to make us two cups of coffee.  This is definitely a hotel worthy of celebrating a special occasion.  Highly recommended!","5","2015-09"
"Burj Al Arab with kids","It all starts with a personal welcome from the lovely hostess who greets you as you step out of the car before you even enter the Burj!  She then takes you up to your suite explaining about some of the hotel facilities as you go up and then your personal butler takes over!  It was an amazing experience as others have said in terms of décor and OTT opulence and so it should be for the price.

Positives
-they had thought of everything for the kids, including 2 different sized luxury robes and slippers, kids toiletries packs, teddies, beautiful cot with luxury baby bedding, a spotless baby bath, the evening sweet trolley, a selection of games consoles with age appropriate games which someone comes and set up for you in your suite, etc, etc
- small but well equipped and clean kids club
- amazing indoor infinity pools on one of the higher floors – certainly a memorable swim!
- small (compared to other Jumeirah properties) breakfast but it was of a high quality, with some excellent products
-great beach & pool service with cool box of water/ flannels, face spray, and popcorn and lollies
- gorgeous full sized Hermes toiletries
- a pillow menu that even included kids options
- beautiful and well maintained facilities throughout
-Allowed us to check into our suite much earlier than the check-in time
- Excellent housekeeping -e.g.  requested them to change the wet bath mats one evening and they came and completely cleaned the whole bathroom whilst we were out
-beautiful complimentary roses and decadent cake for our special anniversary celebration

Negatives
-	No gowns available in ladies SPA mid-morning and I was told to find my own by looking through the empty lockers
-	No offer from the butler to iron clothes when ironing board was requested- not an issue for us but have seen other reviews where this was offered
-	Some butlers have a poor command of English,  i.e. Chinese butler had only basic command of English and could not easily follow a conversation or answer queries easily
-	None of the above were huge issues for us but they are not expected in a so called international “7-star” hotel, with a 7 star price tag!

Overall would definitely stay here again but would choose to eat at the other Jumeirah properties or elsewhere as the food (and drinks) although nice, is very over priced in general!  A few niggles but still an amazing and awesome experience!","4","2015-05"
"what a treat! altho keep it to a 'once in a lifetime'!","With letsgo2 booked we 3 nights for our 20th wed anni. Flew overnight with emirates who were very good! Arrived at about 8 am, bought some wine in duty free, its cheap! As are cigarettes!  easy swift exit out of airport! Caught a taxi , there are numerous outside! Cost 85 dirhams about £17 ( return journey was only 70 dirhams!?) Its about half hour transfer! Check in was as you would imagine, very quick and efficient! The room is incredible! Hermes toiletries lovely apart from the shampoo and the conditioner is awful didnt agree with my hair at all! Ceiling mirror over the bed! Which is amazingly comfy! View incredible!  I swam in the indoor ladies only pool, there wasnt anyone else there, about 18m pool, small but, fantastic, spa area, showers immaculate! There is a 25 m pool in the al qasr which I preferred on previous visit, also an outdoor one past the jumeirah beach hotel! Opens at 6am. As there is no balconies and extensive building works at the burj I was disappointed not to have been made aware of this and there was nowhere to sit ouside, If you want to go to the beach, pool or other hotels facilities you will need to catch a buggy! Very quick efficient service. All the pools in the whole resort are amazing. We were low maintenance guests so didnt use the butler service. Our half board offer included buffet in the asian and arabic buffet. They were both excellent, in both service, setting and quality!  After trying them both we did ask to try the naya indian in the jumeirah beach hotel! We didnt want the same meal again so soon, but we were told  it was not possible! Rather surprised we asked someone else who again said no. I wrote a letter to patrick who had introduced himself earlier food and beverage assistant manager! He had actually confirmed we would be  able to eat there! So after much confusion ( not sure why) we had our reservation and was then advised we had 760 dirhams credit to spend there! Trading a meal in the burj for the jumeirah beach! That seemed rather odd but luckily the lovely robin at naya looked after us as usual! A lot of people come in to take photos, crowds which are always there! Its lovely to visit the other madinat hotels and get a nightime view of them all, and the burj obviously! There is no club level at the buj which we have previously enjoyed in the dar al masaf and the mina (which you also get complimentary airport transfer in a very smart car!) We do prefer that set up, routine. Service is just as good in all the hotels, all immaculate, professional and highly rated! We paid £3800 for us both 3 nights at the burj half board. Others are usually about half that for club level and transfers. So for my requirements I would choose any of the madinat hotels on site. So glad we tried the burj it is breathtaking! Xx hope was helpful","5","2015-09"
"Afternoon tea","Definitely one on the bucket list this one which has been ticked off. Although extremely pricy for afternoon tea I must admit it was worth every penny in my opinion. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and the service and standard of food was impeccable. To start some flavoured dates and a glass of champagne then a small piece of fillet steak with potato and then the sandwiches which were plentiful and kept being topped up with sandwiches of your preference to be honest when the mini desserts came out we were pretty full. The lists of teas and coffees were immense.The staff asked if we were celebrating and occasion and we were my birthday so I received a red rose and a cake saying happy birthday which was such a nice s touch. You also got some burj chocolates after the tea to take home. It was lovely to explore the hotel afterwards. A truly worthwhile and enjoyable experience.","5","2015-03"
"7*???? No such thing......","I will apologise now! This will be a long review, as it is the most money I have ever spent on 1 night out....

......As we live in Dubai we decided to take some good friends up on there offer to join them to stay for the night, and also join them on the Culinary Flight (more later...). I arrived before the rest of the family. 1st annoyance the gate man struggled to find the booking despite me giving name and booking reference 3 times. When I arrived was greeted which was nice, asked to wait in the pretty full lobby. After about 5 minutes was advised that we had a complementary upgrade and shown to the suite and floor. Now the tour and talk and who entrance experience is nice. Having 4 people lined up with Rose Water, cold towels, dates is nice, and I asked that when my wife and boys arrived this was done again - IT WAS NOT. SHAME. The suite? Amazing - I do mean AMAZING - 3000+ Sq Ft. By far the best Suite I have ever stayed in - By a mile....Price? Well we paid 4000AED. Rack rate on this 11000AED - ($3000) A night!

As part of this deal you are served afternoon sandwiches (pretty bland) and also cocktails and ""h'orderves"" in the evening. We went to our friends room for pre dinner drinks. Now turns out that ""h'orderves"" are the same as the afternoon sandwiches are the same...No they are not!! You do not serve sandwiches before dinner!

The drinks? So 7 Star Hotel, you would think would have a great selection and someone trained. You would be wrong, would Sir like Whiskey? Single malt? NOPE Grouse!! Grouse I ask you. Vodka? Russian Standard !!! Lemon with the V&T, nope don't have any, Lime with G&T, and I swear this is true ""sorry sir we do not have any in the hotel, only in the morning"" I kid you not......

Culinary flight: with wine 2000AED per person.

We opted for the pairing menu - The idea here is you start at the top then eat in different restaurants along the way down to the bottom. Good idea badly executed. Firstly the service was slow, secondly you have to order all dishes, thirdly we had to request a cheese board, and fourthly the wine was served way before the meal. That does not constitute pairing....I did complain, and the manager appeared. Who did nothing so I had to ask for the GM. The assistant F&B came, and in fairness ensured the rest of the night went smoothly....The food? Possibly 1* Michelin standard.

Facilities. 

Outdoor pool under renovation, so we used the Exec Pool @ next hotel which was excellent - Really nice. Buggy service is a little slow. We also used wild wadi (no need to charge for lockers - That is cheap after the amount just spent)...

Summary.

Is it 7*? No. 

I have stayed in many 5* Hotels and the service was faultless. When you have nothing to complain about, and you are absolutely blown away could you even begin to call yourself 7*.

We had a great time, and would be worth being on the list of things to do, but MANAGEMENT - WAKE UP - IF YOU CALL YOURSELF 7* YOU NEED TO BE.......","4","2015-09"
"Big & brash, sweet & sour, not sure if we loved it or hated it!","A great place to stay as a one off experience or to put on your bucket list! 

It's big, it's brash, it's completely over the top with mirrors on the ceiling in the bedrooms, clashing colours  and gold leaf everywhere but there's something you can't help but like about the Burj! 

You need to pretty much take out a loan to eat and drink here but you'll love it once you do. The staff are as pretentious as the guests and there's a lot of people walking round thinking they're all it but that surprisingly is actually some of the appeal of the hotel.

The pool area is small but secluded and you almost feel like you're on your yacht gazing out over the gulf?

The views from the rooms are magnificent reaching across Dubai towards old Dubai and the Burj Khalifa or New Dubai to the right.

We stayed 5nights, spent a fortune and couldn't decide if we loved it or hated it ! I guess the fact that I smile when I think about it means I loved it! 

Definitely worth a visit!","4","2014-10"
"Birthday lunch","We went for a birthday lunch for my husband, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, from the greeting at the door to the staff at the reception of the restaurant on the 27th floor. The gentleman who looked after us was named Aman he was lovely, he really knew his stuff he explained all about the food and wine and had a great sense of humour which made the afternoon all the more enjoyable. We were there for 3 hours of pure luxury and indulgence, finished off by lovely birthday cake and a rose for myself. If you ever get the chance please visit this fabulous restaurant and be treated like royalty.","5","2015-09"
"best hotel i have ever stayed in","Everything you have heard about this hotel, doesn't begin to do it justice, all your expectations will be met and beyond, nothing is to much trouble for the staff, the food is out of this world. stayed in delux suite for 25 wedding anniversary, treated like royalty, the hotel pool is never overcrowded, and everything is done for you by attentive staff, would love to go back","5","2014-10"
"7 Star Laxury","It was a amazing experience to spend half day there with fantastic views and the world class luxury. I advice the traveler to visit once by booking online while you are in Dubai or prior to arrive here.","5","2014-11"
"Two Birthdays and a 6yr Anniversary","This was our first stay at the Burj and it was out of this world if you can you must stay here at lease once in your life. High tea at the Sky View Bar on the 27th floor was a great experience, you need to book a few months in advance because of the demand. In the restrooms you have towels to dry your hands instead of tissue and a bottle of perfume for you to freshen up (Hermes).  After tea we were given pens with chocolates at the bottom and a single wrapped red rose. When you go for tea they give you Dates first and it's very disrespectful if you refuse it you must eat one at least. I never liked dates but I did eat it and I have to admit it's nothing like what I had when I was a kid, I absolutely loved it. You must eat all its so good.
We also did a tour around Dubai which was so informative because the tour guide I picked was an absolute darling. Her name is Nara she was very respectable and so informative about the people, culture and everything else. I initially met Nara through Viator so she is legit and she has her tour guide lisence.
I had correspondence with her for months before and added her so that we kept in contact through Whats app, she answered all my questions and also was my voice of reason. When you do a tour you need at least two days but if you only have one day you have to take into consideration that there is traffic. Around the Burj there are other great landmarks like the Juimera Beach hotel, wild wadi park and the Venice of Dubai located in the Madinat Jumeirah, when you enter the grounds you are greeted by life size horses covered in 24k gold which the Sheik owns, he has such a great love for horses. Getting from the Atlantis you need at least an hour . Buy you tickets for the Burj Kalifah online before you travel and do the 142nd floor if you can, the line is way shorter and you get to go higher compared to the 125th floor. At the 142nd floor they put you against a green screen and take photos for you which you can purchase after or you can ask them to put it on a memory stick. The memory stick has the name Burj Kalifah on it.  If you plan to visit Dubai contact Nara +971508725308 , please add the plus sign to the number and once you add it you can talk to her via whats app which will be cost efficient if you live in the U.S.","5","2015-09"
"Burj al arab","Beautiful scenery of burj al arab hotel plus the calm beach in jumeirah..such a perfect view..and dubai is the perfect place to be for a tour i wish i could bring my family there so they will experience to see how amazing the dubai😎","5","2015-09"
"Fantastic birthday celebration","We went to celebrate my husbands birthday which was a surprise. The hotel was superb and staff amazing. They couldn't do enough for us and made lots of effort for my husbands birthday. Also made a huge fuss and attention to our 2 sons whol also thoroughly enjoyed their stay.","5","2015-09"
"Excellent - highly recommend","Everything about our stay at this hotel was magic!  Great staff and amazing rooms - it is a experience we will never forget. The beach, pool, sauna and steam made us not want to leave the hotel and area. Great place to relax.","5","2015-09"
"Truly memorable and excellent service","We had a wonderful weekend at the Burj Al Arab hotel. The service is outstanding and the hotel anticipates your needs and wishes better than anywhere else we have been. Our suite was beautiful, quiet and had a gorgeous view of the marina. The pool is currently undergoing refurbishment and the hotel is building its own beach but there is an indoor mixed pool as well as a ladies only area on the 18th floor and a fantastic gym. Just across the bridge the hotel has allocated a separate beach area for Burj al Arab guests only and all hotel guests are invited to use the pools and facilities across the other Jumeirah properties. Buggies are always available to take you to the various beaches, Wild Wadi, tennis courts, the Madinat Jumeirah etc.. We had breakfast in the main breakfast restaurant ( you can also opt for in suite breakfast or an Asian buffet at Junsui). As expected, all breakfast items were delicious with a wide choice of fresh juices, fruits and the usual hot and cold items. We could not have wished for a more relaxing and luxurious experience. Thank you to the Burj team!","5","2015-09"
"On my wifes bucket list - what a place","Picked up in the uniformed chauffeur driven car, wife presented with bunch of flowers and I'm thinking, this is a good start and then you arrive. Blown away by the whole experience, the luxury and opulence are truly amazing. We were whisked off to our room, introduced to our floor concierge and butler and then took in the full splendour of the room, its fixtures, fittings and amazing views. It is truly a fantastic experience. 
We spent hours just sitting looking at the room, the hotel lobby, mezzanine floors, fountains, luxury shops. We also had afternoon tea, another unforgettable experience, afternoon tea may not sound much, but at the end of 7 courses and glass of champagne, we were wondering how we would manage dinner later.
Dinner in the Jinsui Asian restaurant was also amazing, the staff, chefs could not do enough and the food was mouth watering. Breakfast was sumptuous and catered for every taste and need.
It's hard to describe just how luxurious this place is. 
A nice time to wander round and appreciate the hotel is after the various daytime visitors have left for the day and early morning, it is just fabulous to sit, admire and take in the whole experience.
Special mention to our fabulous floor concierge who catered for our every need, they do a fantastic job","5","2015-09"
"Birthday brunch ","This review is for a couple of years back, me and my husband are in the sky restaurant and it was wonderful! I was given a cake and a rose oh and card to say happy birthday. This place really treats you like you are 7*! Now I have left dubai I miss seeing this beautiful building from my balcony which I was so lucky to have as my living room view.","5","2014-10"
"Honeymoon","Stayed in a deluxe room 25-27th August, arrived early via the optional rolls royce pick up to a ready room, flowers and cake, Krishna our butler was very helpful with our queries, room was very nice, small gifts at night, Hermes perfumes for both, ate at 3 of the restaurants all very nice inc the al mahara, visited the sky bar for drinks, private beach using burj buggys with comp ice lollies, spa was incredible with an excellent quiet infinity pool, got a tour of the royal suite which is out of this world, and allowed a late checkout- my only one little criticism was that no special upgrade to the next level of room- which our other hotels provided (which is why I even bother to bring it up) even thought they knew in advance it was our honeymoon. All in all a excellent hotel and would love to return, their level of service is unheard of, brilliant","4","2015-08"
"A World-Class Experience","Words cannot begin to describe the opulence of this place. To give you some idea of how exclusive this place is, our taxi driver had been driving cabs for 7 years in Dubai and had never crossed the bridge that connects the hotel to the mainland. From the very minute you arrive, you are constantly in awe of the surroundings and the decadence of this hotel.

Once we were transported to the restaurant at the Skybar, the view takes your breath away. For three hours we sat and took in the magnificent views of Dubai, The Palm and the crystal clear ocean. 

This is truly a once in a lifetime experience. It is a MUST DO for anyone going to Dubai and something you will not regret, nor forget anytime soon. I cannot recommended this hotel highly enough. ","5","2015-01"
"Heaven on Earth !!!","One of the most Lavish , Elegant and Undoubtedly the BEST hotel I have visited !!!
I celebrated my Birthday on 7th September along with my wife at AL IWAN restaurant.

"Wonderful ","Amazing property.  Came here for afternoon Tea and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The service was first class, as one might expect.  Afternoon tea costs around $160 per person and includes a decent amount of food, a glass of champagne, and a small gift.  If you are feeling up to a romantic afternoon, I suggest the tea at 4:30, and if you can afford it, order a bottle of wine and sit and watch the sun set over the Persian Gulf. It Is a wonderful experience and you will be cared for by a highly trained service staff.  

Don't expect the most amazing snack bites for the food, but do expect an amazing ambiance, atmosphere and surroundings.","5","2015-09"
"Best and most expensive in Dubai","Great hotel. Great service. Mega super expensive. Really, if you can not spend a 1000$ a day in spa, tips, amenities, and little bits and pieces... Just go to the other hotel, it wouldn't be too much worse but you enjoy it better. But if you really have money and dont count every 100$ spent GO TO Burj Al Arab, it is worth it!","5","2015-02"
"The Best...Ever","Took a 4 day long break here on the way to Australia, what a 4 days it was. Our son was looked after as if he were one of the staff's own, nothing it too much trouble, both integral restaurants are out of this world, the lower ground fish tank being our preferred. Room service, exquisite, our sons 'burger' was the best steak i've ever tasted.
Entrance the wadi water park is included, along with golf buggy transfer with priority access, and again, kids so well looked after by the staff. What a place, would suggest this being ticked off the bucket list, even if it's just a visit and a meal, perfect in every sense.","5","2014-10"

"Extraordinary in every way","For once, believe the hype. Breathtaking in every way, from the outside's billowing sail higher than the Eiffel tower to the arrival by white Rolls Royce. Extraordinary restaurants and service, the most amazing views, suites bigger than most houses and unbridlled, unashamed opulence. Go for fun, for a once in a lifetime experience. You won't regret it.","5","2015-08"
"Best experience","I was there for NYE celebration, it is something that i have to do at least once in a life time. The price is high, but you get what you paid for. We tried sky bar at night. You barely see anything, again the price for wine and cannapes is over price as well. You can easily spend min usd 500 for 2 person for very basic wine. But again, it is just something that you have to do.","5","2015-01"
"Best service ever","Just spent the best day and nite at the Burj Al Arab. From arrival the staff could not have done anything more for us. The room was as big as a house and most luxurious. We dined at the Junsui Asian restaurant and had the best  buffet meal ever. Amil served us up a feast of foods that were unbelievable with the best service you could want. Breakfast was lovely with a great variety of tasty foods. This trip Was my 50th birthday treat and staff surprised with a delicious chocolate birthday cake , they even boxed it to take away to our next hotel. Loved every minute","5","2015-09"
"Wow how the other half lives,well worth the visit","Came here for my 50th birthday I cried when the door opened up wow what a view , room was a bit OTT blue and gold. Bedroom was to due for up the sweeping marble staircase. Free perfume to take home.
Stayed in the room most of the time, swimming a disappointment too small for the size of the hotel.
Indoor pool ladies side was lovely but lonely without my husband. For that special occasion it's well worth it , not for a holiday though.  Came back here a couple of years later didn't have the same impacted as the first time, but still lovely to stay the night. Breakfast is to die for,","5","2015-03"

"""Once in a lifetime experience""","This hotel is dubbed as the ""only 7 star hotel in the world!' so my husband and I stayed for 2 nights for first hand experience enjoying the luxuries of this hotel. 
We booked a package that included roundtrip Dubai Airport transfer. Well, first and foremost, the hotel rate is overpriced! ($1300/night + fees). Yes, the hotel is fancy with many amenities, gold trimmings everywhere, and you have your own 24hr butler service always ready for your disposal. We were on the 22nd floor panoramic suite, awesome view overlooking the ocean and the Jumeirah Beach Resort next door! The room has it's own office, living room, and you go up the stairs to your bedroom. Toiletries were Hermes brand! Breakfast was included in our package, we opted for the international flare and the Asian fusion (w/ noodles, etc), food and service was great. We booked an afternoon tea on the 27th floor of the hotel, it was 7 course, servings were abundant that you don't need to eat dinner, but then again it is also overpriced. I have to say the customer service was extraordinary, the staff was friendly and attentive to our  needs. There is a buggy ride service for free that can take you to the neighboring sister resort, Jumeirah Beach and Madinat Jumeirah.  Overall, it was quite an experience, you have to stay at least once in your lifetime at this hotel. The reason why I did not give an ""Excellent"" rating at this hotel is because I don't think it is worth the above rate.","4","2015-07"
"One for the bucket list","This was our third visit to 'The Burj' and it won't be our last. 
This hotel has the best rooms available, fantastic service and great food.
From the moment you arrive to the time you reluctantly leave, you are treated like royalty. This is an experience everyone should experience at least once in their life.","5","2015-08"
"Burj Al Arab, the finest Hotel in the World","I am very delightful to visit the seven star hotel with full of luxury and enjoyed the sea view from inside the hotel. Its nice place to visit to see the different things which is full of luxury. I will try to visit one again when I have time.","5","2014-12"
"Not as good as you would think","We (my wife and I)  went for afternoon tea at the Burj.  first, I should point out that we are seasoned travelers that often stay in good hotels (the Ritz London etc) and often eat at good restaurants (The Ivy, Fortnam & Mason etc) so I feel I understand what quality service should encompass. 
The Burj portrays itself as a 7 star establishment, but that is definitely not correct.
I don't wish to sound ""picky"", but the service is very robotic, rehearsed, same same, almost as if the staff are bored.  I will list my points (however I am being critical here)
1. The sandwiches were very hard on the outside, like they had been sitting for a long time on the open.
2.  I asked for the sandwiches to be replaced, they were replaced, but the waiter brought out a HUGE steel tray full of sandwiches and placed one of each on my plate......school dinner style.
3.  Between courses no one wiped or cleaned the crumbs from the table (7 star service ???)
4.  Even though we did comply with the dress code, not all diners did.  we were STRICTLY warned (on the phone) that ladies MUST wear heels......I think my wife was the only one that did.
5.  The cakes were nice, but again bordering on stale.

Above are a few points.  In other hotels they may be acceptable, but the worlds ONLY 7 star establishment........hmm.  Actually, the Holiday inn could probably achieve the same standards with ease.
I am not a Multi-Millionaire that expects perfection on all fronts, BUT when the establishment proclaims 7 star standards, they should deliver, and they don't.
On our next trip to Dubai, we will stay at the Burj, just because it is the Burj and I want to experience the ""thrill"" of 7 star hospitality and to see if the service is the same as other 5 Star hotels we have used.
I would not take the afternoon tea though.........almost 100 pounds per person.....certainly 7 star pricing.
We did enjoy the indoor fountains and the large fish tanks, as well as looking at the cars outside.  Its a pity we will remember the fountains with fonder memories than the food.
Of course, the views were nice, nice views of Plastic Fantastic Dubai.........but hardly worth 200 Quid !!!","3","2015-09"
"Family experience","Been traveling to Dubai for 10 years now and I was finally lucky enough to experience a stay at the finest hotel in Dubai. The suites have an offer allowing three children under 11 years to stay complimentary with 2 adults. I was a little worried taking children to such a posh place but I was pleasantly surprised. 
The hotel has a small kids club on the 18th floor. You can leave your kids to play there as long as they are over the age of 3. The children can also use the spa swimming pool (although it is quite deep for smaller children). Wild Wadi waterpark is a small ride away but is complimentary to all guests and the hotel provides shuttle buggys to take you there. You can also use the pools in the surrounding jumeirah hotels which are more child friendly and have kids food menus. 
The restaurants have small goody bags, toys and colouring for entertaining children. 
I was able to order milk for my little one in the room without any extra charges. 
In the room, the children are provided with their own children's toiletries. They get their own slippers and a new toy or chocolate every night!! 
The staff can never do enough for the children. 
I would recommend parents with young children to not shy away and I will definitely go there again !!","5","2015-08"
"The Best Hotel In The World","We have just returned from a fantastic 7 night stay at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai.  It truly is the best hotel in the world and everyone should experience this 7 star hotel at least once in a lifetime.
Nothing is too much trouble for the excellent staff and the attention to detail is second to none.
Syed our Executive Butler and Nadia were first-class and a credit to Burj - as were Gabriel, Johnson and the guys at the beach/pool - they certainly do make things happen.and dreams come true.
Have stayed once on the Palm (which was nice but not the same) - there is just no comparison. We will certainly be visiting the Burj again and look forward to seeing the newly refurbished pool and beach area next year.
Thank you for another wonderful experience","5","2015-08"
"absolutely amazing!","Our first visit to the Burj - an excellent experience.  The standard suites are beautiful - very comfortable and spacious.  The butlers are always available and will go out of their way to help with a smile - really incredible service.  The hotel is not new but very well maintained - it feels luxurious and impressive the moment you walk in.

Spa and gym staff very friendly as well.  Excellent treatment.","5","2015-08"
"High afternoon tea - a must do experience!","We heard about the excellent reputation of the High Afternoon Tea experience in the Sky Bar at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai - and we booked in with high expectations - and it didn't disappoint.
The Sky Bar is on the 127th floor, and has its own lift - the hotel itself is incredible, and well staff on the security front, and you cant just turn up and have a walk in appointment - everything needs to be pre-booked, otherwise you wont even pass the first stage of security at the gate.

The food and service was incredible - from delicate finger sandwiches to handmade pastries and cakes and a vast array of teas from around the world and iced teas - the passion fruit ice tea was delicious!

It does sound expensive when you look at the price (approx' £100/person), but this includes a 7 course high afternoon tea, including a glass of champagne, and if you're still hungry, you can ask for more finger sandwiches and pastries - as they'll refill your trays, but we were absolutely stuffed!

We were given some handmade chocolates and a little gift on our departure, which is a nice little treat - and is given to everyone!

The views were incredible! So glad we went!","5","2015-08"
"The 'Burj' doesn't disappoint","This is the third time that we have stayed at Burj Al Arab and it was as wonderful as the first. The butlers are so helpful and always greet you with a smile. It truly is a 7 star experience.Hope to return when the new pool area is completed. Thank you for a great start to our holiday.","5","2015-08"
"Shisha & drinks at the Sky bar ","My family and I booked the Burj for Shisha and drinks at the sky bar. When you enter the Burj it really is impressive and immediately you can see why this is a 7* hotel. The decor is very grande and majestic. We had shisha in the outdoor lounge are located by the sea it's very nice and ambiance was relaxed. After our Shisha we went to the sky bar located at the very top of the Burj which means you get a spectacular view of Dubai. The mock tails are delicious and the sky bar has a great atmosphere. I would highly recommend this for a night out but make sure you book in advance at both the Shisha lounge and sky bar.

"Burj Al Amazing","Possibly the best hotel in the world due to excellent customer service it provides. The hotel itself itself looks amazing. The rooms  are presented well and private dining is exceptional, infact we had an aquatic environment as a dining area! Definitely worth the money.","5","2015-02"
"Oh wow!","We were upgraded to a superior suite, so we had two separate bedrooms / bathrooms/dressing rooms/lounges/dining areas as well as a kitchen and a bar/office area. Bigger than my house! Super views over dubai. The staff were attentive. Well done everyone :)","5","2015-08"
"Outstanding","We have stayed a couple of times at The Burj Al Arab and would highly recommend this experience.

On the last visit we had cocktails in the sky bar at Sunset and this alone was an experience second to none. 

Experience the bar or the afternoon tea here at the very least.. You will not be disappointed.","5","2015-01"
"Burj Al Arab","As far as the hotel amenities, service, rooms all is great.  Although extremely expensive from food to beverages, drinks etc... during our stay in July 2015 at the Burj Al Arab  I was disturbed by 3 specific events.  We were a family of 4 and we booked the 2 bedrooms suites which is enormous. At the last minute my nephew decided to join us and upon verifying on their website it clearly states that the room can accommodate 6 people, no where it is mentioned that there is extra cost. Upon arrival i was charged 1800 DAE per night extra for my nephew to sleep in this room. I had no choice it was payable immediately with no further explanation. I was in Paris the week before and Plaza Athenee did not charge me anything for him.  Upon our arrival the blocked 15000 Canadian on my credit for incidents, I told them it was too much but they said its policy, so again no arguing there. Three days later they blocked another 15000 Canadian, at the point I told the supervisor of the floor  (the 12th floor) that this is crazy I don t intend to spend that kind of money and you are blocking my card for 9 days. I said just charge me on a daily basis and don't block anything he said no again its policy.  So no choice, again.  So we continue our journey and we decide to go for a drink at the Sky Bar, upon arrival they advised us that 2 of my kids are 19 and not allowed in, so I said we came all the way from Canada let us visit and they wont have drinks, they said no you have to leave....never in my country I experienced this kind of attitude and plus i was not expecting it from a 7 stars hotel....  and finally but last no one advised us that we had access to all the pools in the area, they kept us at the executive pool without saying anything, on the last day someone (a traveler told us) was too late we were flying out the next day.  In conclusion, I felt we did not belong there..... it would be nice if the Burj sees this review and refunds me at least my nephew's stay just because they don't advise you ahead of time, I would of been prepared.  I would like to thank Roberto our butler he was amazing.  I suggest that if you go to this hotel expect a lot of hidden cost, make sure you call and get all the details before you book.","4","2015-07"
"Beautiful breakfast","On arrival I have to say I was disappointed.
There was 2 guests that came in before us and they were treated to dates, a small coffee and warm towels, they must have been hotel guests but as we came the staff just walked away. We were not met and greeted or shown to the breakfast area, this took away from the luxury of the experience.
Once we were seated the whole experience changed and the level of customer care we received was very good, the food was amazing and we enjoyed all of the different plates. 
I would highly recommend the breakfast if you wanted to see inside the burj and have a touch of luxury!!","4","2015-07"
"Overrated. ","My husband took me to Burj for afternoon tea as a special birthday present... High expectations can be a dangerous thing! When we arrived by taxi at the door, no porters were there to open doors or greet us ... In the end I just got out of the car and walked in. (7*???) Our 5* hotel always had 3 staff at the door waiting to greet people arriving so we expected this as basic. The hotel decor is amazing, and the view from the lift ride to the sky restaurant is stunning. The afternoon tea was beautifully served and was very special and they presented me with a little birthday cake, flower and a box of chocolates which was a nice gesture (mind you, it is very very expensive!). The staff were welcoming and helpful.

On the way out, as I had a small handbag, and was carrying the gifts, I asked the reception if they had a bag I could put my things in, they replied, 'No madam, we have no bags but if you ask at the main desk downstairs they may have one'. (7*???). (My hotel in Dubai would have had staff running to find me a small bag). Approaching the main desk on the ground floor, I again asked the receptionist would she have a bag. I was immediately told,'No madam, we have no bags'. Again, I said, I was just looking for something to hold my gifts and I received the same dismissive reply. 'I am in charge here and I know there are no bags!' (7*?????)..... A bag! A trivial thing - but I left feeling that the staff really don't care much about the needs of customers and that I definitely wouldn't want to stay there, or recommend it. I was sorry such a small thing overshadowed our visit.","3","2015-08"
"Yes Yes it's just like you imagine but with one exception","As all the other reviewers have written this place is over the top in luxury from the full size amenities, to the personal butler service, to the décor in the lobby, restaurants, spa and suites!  Stay if you can as it is one of life's bucket list entries and will make you feel like you know what it is to be famous. Everything to be expected in a 7 star hotel. But what I didn't expect and the only ding I could find was the mind boggling fact that they did not serve pork bacon even in room service.  As opposed to Dubai's Hiltons, the Marriotts and the Ritz Carton where if you ask quietly you will be served, the entire Burj hotel is halal. Yes, yes, it's a Muslim country, I get that, but the only 7 star hotel in the world and it doesn't allow guests to be served bacon, wow.","5","2015-08"
"What an amazing experience!!","I was fortunate to stay at the Burj Al Arab in June for a number of nights, the hotel is simply incredible...from the moment you walk in. My flights landed early morning, check in wasn't until 3, however the hotel made a room available.. I was taken to the suite and signed everything within the room itself, followed by a tour of the suite..

My suite was huge, immaculately presented and incredibly luxurious (wasn't so sure about the colours)... But I guess it was a few years old..

I am trying to pick faults but just cannot.. The staff were attentive, polite and service was brilliant... A huge recommendation for anyone planning on staying there.

"Extraordinary Arabic luxury","The design is very private for all customers. You can not see any customer walking on the room floor from lobby. The decoration is extreme luxurious Arabic style. The service is excellent, flawless, and international. Their butler can speak your language(I believe almost). There are many amazing hotels in Dubai, but only Burj al Arab is the perfect combination in Arabian style and meets international service requirement!","5","2015-08"
"Amazing hotel!","Most exclusive hotel I've ever been in. Everything is ""on the level"". We had a suit on 19. floor. Every floor has its own reception and batler. The suit is huge with everything you need. The view is amazing. It's panoramic and you can see The Palm and The World they are building.
Everything in this hotel is great. Since we had our flight early in the morning we requested breakfast in the room,they were on time with very good healthy breakfast.
They arranged us their Lexus taxi to take us to the airport.
Hope we will stay longer next time and try everything they have to offer.","5","2015-08"
"Al Iwan Arab Buffet","Four of us visited the restaurant as part of my wife's 50th birthday celebrations.  We were staying at Al Qasr so we paid a supplement on top of our half board package as a special treat.  We were taken by a lovely chap from Al Qasr on the golf buggy who stopped to take photos on the way.  On arrival we spent half an hour marvelling at this wonderful hotel and took more pictures!  We were then welcomed into the restaurant and looked after well.  Our only gripe was that a guest at the table next to us was playing loud music on his gold plated iPhone. After a few minutes we asked him to stop as the restaurant staff did not seem to want to intervene.  We thought the staff should have dealt with it but I was not going to let an arrogant guest spoil our special meal after which he and his family left the restaurant.  From thereon, all was well and we enjoyed a wonderful buffet in luxurious surroundings.  It was expensive but I was happy to pay the additional £100 per head as my wife had been looking forward to visiting this special hotel and I was pleased to be able to make one of her dreams come true!","5","2015-08"
"Exceptional in Everything","i been to many 5 stars hotel around the globe, by Faaaar This Hotel is beyond any expectations.
It is 100 stars not 7 stars.
EXCEPTIONAL in everything. Outstanding.
worth each riyal you pay for it. DO NOT hesitate to book it. especially if you wana amaze your wife or Soul mate.","5","2015-08"
"Wow","If I could give a higher rating for this hotel then I would.
Where do I start?
It's expensive but it's worth it.
The suites are enormous, the service is amazing.
It's very beautiful inside, lots of gold and marble.
We went for an early morning workout in the gym (separate male and female gyms) then had a swim in the indoor pool ( there is a mixed pool and a female only one also) We were the only people in there swimming 40 floors up in an infinity pool with floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the sea. 
From check in to check out it was an amazing experience.
Huge spa bath in the bathroom with regular sized his and hers Hermes perfumes and toiletries to keep. 
We had dinner in the restaurant with the huge fish tank in the middle (can't remember the name of it) we had the tasting menu with wine matching (very generous portions of food and wine!!) 
We are quite picky - especially when paying a lot of money for somewhere and we absolutely can't fault the Burj.

"Luxury at its best","the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in, food and service out of this world, great pool, great location, just a short taxi ride away from both Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates, both a must see.","5","2015-07"

"Outstanding","I came here for a week with family and had the most delicious breakfast & service possible. I would recommend the pineapple or watermelon juice (best I have ever had). Overall, it is a hotel out of this world and they make sure every guest is treated like VIP.

P.S. The elevator is as fast as a rocket!","5","2014-09"
"High tea only","We just had to see this hotel but their high tea was the only way for us. Booking is essential if you want a window seat. We arrived half an hour early as requested which gave us time to admire the amazing interior complete with a fountain and aquarium. At 1pm we were ushered one couple at a time to the lift and up to the 23rd floor.  Service and food (four courses of cakes, pastries and sandwiches) was exactly as expected for this hotel, totally amazing. A great spot to enjoy the view but very pricy.","5","2015-08"
"Luxury at its best!","Luxurious experience. Arranged for Rolls Royce transfer from airport to hotel (AED 900) and  Mercedes Benz transfer from hotel to airport (AED 450). Stayed at a one bedroom panoramic suite (about AED 10,000) for 2 nights via booking.com. Dined at the seafood restaurant (with aquarium) and at Al Muntaha fine dining at the 27th floor - great food and ambiance, but enjoyed Al Muntaha more. The spa and indoor pool area was a bit small, did not appeal to me too much. But buggies are always available to take you to the beach, guests have free access to the surrounding 5 star beaches/hotels also owned/managed by Jumeirah hotel.  All in all, worth it, great experience at Dubai's iconic 7 star hotel.","5","2015-07"
"Amazing Stay","We recently returned from 2 nights at the Burj Al Arab where we enjoyed an absolutely fantastic stay. Every moment at the hotel from arrival to departure is defined by great service, attention to detail and a highly personalized experience. We arrived and were immediately greeted by the guest relations staff and given a brief tour of the lobby along with a welcome snack of dates and Arabic coffee. We were then taken to our enormous suite for check in. The whole process was incredibly smooth and took all of the stress out of a normally painful process. 

The rooms are very spacious and brightly colored. The interior decor wasn't really my taste, but its hard to not appreciate the beauty and attention to detail. It's hard to imagine that the hotel is 15 years old as everything looks brand new. There is a concierge desk on every floor that does everything from make restaurant reservations to arranging room cleaning while you are out. This was a very nice touch as all the normal hotel room cleaning services revolved around our schedule.

While at the hotel we at at Al Muntaha and had tea in Sahn Eddar, both meals were fabulous and rather memorable. The view from Al Muntaha is stunning and the food was first rate. The in room private dining is also a great option as the menu is quite large and the service is 24 hours. 

To top it all off the hotel came with free access to Wild Wadi water park which is a fun excursion during the hotter parts of the day. Overall I can't really recommend this hotel highly enough. Its fame makes it a bit of a tourist attraction, but it is totally worth the stay. I am looking forward to returning and enjoying the hotel more.","5","2015-08"

"The Posh hotel - Burj Al Arab","The design of a sail, the hotel is magnificent and majestic. We just took photos in front of it from far in the beach. But you can go in formal dress inside the hotel to have a cocktail which would be a memorable moment for yourself in Dubai. The hotel has duplex rooms in all floors. 
","4","2015-08"
"Has to be at the top of your list of things to do in Dubai","We went to the Skyview bar for drinks for my Wife's birthday.  Overall the experience was fantastic.  There was a minimum spend of 350 aed (approx £70 per person).  For that we were able to order any Food or Drinks off the menu.  I opted for 3 bottles of Kopparberg & my wife had 3 Cocktails.  We were given a tray in the shape of The Burj Al Arab full of canapes & nuts we also received a birthday cake because I had informed them about it being my wife's birthday. Our reservation was at 7pm so we were able to see the sunset over the Arabian Gulf & Dubai from the best seats in the house.  A truly magical experience.

Great value for money, great service.  Next time we go to Dubai we are planning on staying there.","5","2015-08"
"Excellent ","Fabulous place to stay must be one of the worlds best hotels with incredible views a visit the sky bar is a must where any drink you can imagine will be expertly made for you . Staff are very professional and very welcoming nothing is too much trouble . A real must visit when in Dubai . ","5","2015-05"
"Utterly fabulous, even with children","We took advantage of a lower summer rate to book a stay here with the kids, aged 6 and 10. We stayed in the most basic suite. This consists a massive living area (more than enough space for a large sofa bed and one extra single bed without even noticing a loss of floor space) and an upstairs King bedroom with enormous bathroom. There was more than enough space for all of us.
A 'sweet' butler visited in the early evening, offering the children their pick of sweets and milkshakes and,  of course, you get free entry to Wild Wadi, which the children loved (and made us feel we got a chunk of the room-rate back!). We also had access to the Sinbad Kids' Club at Jumeirah Beach hotel - didn't use it, but it's nice to know things are well set up for kids should you want some adult time.
As adults, the hotel made us feel very special from the in-room check-in to the complimentary Hermes toiletries and bottle of branded red wine. The service was exemplary, and the buffet breakfast was not massive but was absolutely perfect and included a small offering of traditional Emirati items.
The Burj is not a cheap hotel but it really does out-class everywhere else we've stayed. And the views are amazing.","5","2015-08"
"Once in a Lifetime","I originally looked at the Burj Al Arab for my wife's birthday but discounted it due to the price. I was leaning towards the Diplomatic Suite at Raffle's Dubai again which was less than half the price of their most basic room. A few days later I noticed an advert on an internet page mentioning the residents offer. I went back, looked that up and whilst it was still expensive I decided to push the boat out. I even went up a room class to the Panoramic Suite.

We arrived slightly early and the front door service was excellent. The car was quickly taken away and luggage sorted. We were informed we'd been upgraded from the Panoramic Suite that I'd booked to a Club Suite. We were taken direct to the room to check in there.

Wow. Words cannot describe that room. A massive living area with two seating areas separated with a spacious bar. A two story high wall of glass looking over the sea, the palm and Dubai itself. The views were breathtaking. A huge 50+"" TV is on the back of the bar which broke up the vast room and made the far seating area the TV area. Next to that was a large dining area. Behind that a snooker room with a full sized snooker table! Off that was a kitchen! Sweeping stairs takes you from the bar area up to a mezzanine floor which has the office and a thrid sitting area. Then it is into the bedroom with pop up TV and a mirror above the bed! The bathroom was amazing with huge Jacuzzi and massive shower. Toiletries are out of this world with full sized Hermes bath and shower products as well as his and hers eau du toilette. You have 24 hour butler service (there were 8 rooms on the floor and shared a butler) and the service was great. Everything is covered in goldleaf and makes the rooms look opulant as you would expect. It wasn't a room, it was a 330m2 palace.

The main pool was closed for refurbishment so we used the pool on the 18th floor. Whilst small, it was an experience swimming in an infinity pool 36 stories up (each floor is double height as the rooms are two levels) overlooking Dubai.

For pre-dinner drinks we visited the Skyview bar. Again service was outstanding. We were given a table only to have the lady come back 30 seconds later as there was a table with a better view available. As expected it was expensive but the service is impeccable.

Dinner was in the Mahara restaurant downstairs. An amazing setting with the massive tropical aquarium. The food was great, but you are paying for the experience. Was it the best fillet steak I've ever had? No. Was it the most expensive? By far! However I've never eaten in a more unique restaurant than this. Again service was impeccable and a surprise birthday cake was provided for my wife.

Rather than going back to the bar as we usually do we retired to the suite. It was such an amazing room we wanted to savor as much as we could. I called for some ice and had some within a minute. Amazing service.

Breakfast was good if a little crowded in the main restaurant. On our return our butler brought another surprise birthday cake for the wife and a small bunch of roses. We had a late checkout and it was very smooth.

A lot of my friends are asking the big question. Was it worth it? That is a difficult question to answer. The easy answer is, no it wasn't. I spent over 8000 dirhams for one night (and we didn't drink much). I've had similar service at Raffles. I've had better steak at Prime 68. I've had better breakfast at the Shangri-la. However the settings are what you pay for here. I doubt I will ever stay in a more amazing room with 24 hour butler service seconds away.

However if you can afford it, you must do it! It’s an amazing experience and whilst it is truly an experience its also horrendously expensive. Don't get me wrong, I am glad we did it, but we cannot justify 1500 GBP for one night that could get us a week away all-inclusive in a beach resort. 

If you can afford it, do it. It’s something you'll always remember. Never say never, but I doubt we'll go back as its out of our price range. However I will always be glad we did it this once and even with hindsight, I'd have still done it.","5","2015-08"
"Luxurious once in a lifetime experience","It is worth it to stay at the burj al Arab at least for one night. Personalized service, large rooms with two floors and computer. 24 hour services from a personal butler. The beach is just a ride away in a golf cart. It has a gym and an infinity pool with great news of Dubai.","5","2015-08"
"Afternoon tea at The Sky Bar","We celebrated my 50th birthday with a champagne afternoon tea, we weren't sure what to expect but oh my word, what a lovely experience , the service was excellent and so was the food. We had requested a window table overlooking the marina below , we got what we asked for  and the view was breathtaking. We were served with a glass of champagne, then there was a strawberry pana cotta type of dish, then a small duck pie, followed by a palette cleansing sorbet, then came the sandwiches and following that the most beautiful cakes, scones and preserves, all washed down with as much speciality tea, coffee and soft drink as required, more champagne can be bought at an extra charge, I also got a lovely birthday cake and a rose as it was my birthday that day.  We were there for about 2 and a half hours and the time flew by, it was a very special experience which I would recommend (in fact I already have to a friend who is visiting in September), who knows I might be very lucky one day and be able to visit again myself!","5","2015-07"
"Little heaven on earth....","I had a very nice time with my familly here and couldn't have asked for better service!  The staff was so friendly that we did not want for anything! 
The location and the view was fantastic.  We could not have had a better time anywhere else in the world","5","2014-11"
"AMAZING! 7 Star 'Heaven'!","My seven year old grandson came to Burj Al Arab for a 'sleep-over'!( He has previously stayed on two occasions.) Before he went to bed he shared our 'amenities' and some especially for him; he said , 'Am I in heaven or Burj Al Arab?' He slept for 11 hours on what must be the best beds ever!
7 star treatment from touchdown to take-off!","5","2015-08"
"Outstanding service","Cannot fault the service! The butlers anticipate all your needs and requirements. Outstanding customer service and attention to detail is second to none. Immaculately clean and the only drawback is the in your face bling! In room dining was excellent, and such a vast choice. 
But I guess some folk must love it. Been, seen, done it; but won’t be going back, one less of the, to do list.","4","2015-07"
"Great Service and experiance","Hi

Usually I don't write reviews but the service I received at the Burj AL Arab was so good I felt compelled to share it. It is more expensive than your regular hotel but the amenities and the staff made it value for money in my eyes. The butler on your floor is available for any request day and night. Special thanks to Richard, Gorden and Sanjeev. Every room is a suite and it is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed for 2 nights. I checked out on my final day and I had learned that my flight had been delayed by 15 hours. I explained what had happened and they gave me a late check out untill 6pm. Which I thought was very accommodating from the staff. My flight still wasn't due to leave until 5am the nest day. The manager Daniela heard what was happening to me and told me they couldn't possibly let me wait in the airport for all that time so they gave me the suite for what was virtually another night. Free of charge. Truly remarkable experience. Many Thanks Burj Al Arab.","5","2015-08"
"Didnt get to try their spa","It is very very expensive, one of the most expensive stay I ever did.
Not the best though.
The room is stunning, especially with that kind of view.
The butler was very attentive, they recognize you right away and greet accordingly.
The food though, was not as great as it could have been.
The spa was fully booked and we could not get a slot for the two for the 3 days we stayed, so you might want to book in advance.
There were lots of very loud and noisy people.
To be honest, I would rather spend that money elsewhere.
But it's worth booking one night just to have a taste of it.

One thing that is really disappointing is the ""shuttle"" service. We wanted to go to the water park and was told there's a shuttle service every 10-15 mins. We waited around 30 mins and no one came. Went back to ask / confirm there's such service, the lady gave us a look like ""why cant you just wait, told you its there""
we end up just walk there ourselves.
Not the best service, probably because they got too many super VIP to serve, we are just ""nobody""","4","2015-02"
"Wow","Wow, what a place. We had the pleasure of spending a week here and have to say it is probably the best hotel we have been to.
The level of customer service is crazy The fact that the noticed what perfume and aftershave we were wearing and to our surprise to find new bottles there the next morning gives an insight into the detail they go to.
The sky bar is a must see and the cocktails are varied and entertaining to watch  be made. 
We will be sure to visit again.","5","2014-12"
"Amazing","OMG what an amazing hotel .Unfortunately could only stay here for two nights would have loved longer.The staff were brilliant nothing was to much trouble,even to tha problem I had trying to get Wi Fi the IT man was ther in minutes to solve my problem don't think you would get that kind of service any where else>Expensive stay but was worth every penny,a once in alife time holiday","5","2015-07"
"Special Place","Stayed here for two nights with two friends to celebrate our birthdays and we weren't disappointed. The suite was huge and the service amazing. We arrived back in our suite after a meal in the Aquarium restaurant to a group of singing butlers who presented us with a birthday cake and a bouquet of red roses each! The staff were totally attentive and made you feel very special. I was a little disappoint with the pool area as it is a bit dated. (Especially comparing it to The Palace Hotel where we spent the first three nights of our holiday) Four months later, I am still using the fantastic full size Hermes products that were given to each of us during our stay. It's expensive but totally worth it!","5","2015-04"
"Luxurious rooms & property  but staff needs better training","I forgot when exactly it was when we visited, as we travel awfully lot, but it couldn't have been longer than 4 months ago. Rooms: all of them spectacular.  Ours was two story and oppulent, Vegas meets Greek Revival on steroids so to say. But I enjoyed it. Full array of cosmetics in every bathroom with large bottles of the Hermes Line including the fragrance itself. Nice! Private Butler on every floor. Most of this hotel is actually empty space caused by the huge atrium lobby , which gives a sort of Stargate feel when you leave your room. Lunch was not exceptional and the restaurant was quite busy, dinner at Al Maharan was an  improvement. We had informed restaurant staff on several occasion about my gluten/dairy intolerance. Unfortunately that was widely  ignored and I was served a meal containing such ingredients, not only that also nuts I was allergic to  and we ended up having to call a nurse. Not pleasant. I think we received some treats to 'make up' for the troubles... treats which also contained the same nuts I was allergic too. Not very thoroughly thought through. Another experience at the upstairs gym: I asked an eastern-european staff member how to operate  the Power-Plate machine, as I never used one in the past. She barely moved her eyes off the computer at the desk. She must have been terribly busy ---- funny because it was only my husband and I who actually were IN the gym. I refused to give up and now asked with more enforcement if she could actually GET UP and  SHOW me how this machine worked, so with exceptionally curbed enthusiasm said person got up, walked over, pressed an 'on' button (duh, could have done that myself) and left. No explanation whatsoever. For several thousand Dollars a night I expect better service. Sorry, unacceptable. In general I found there was a lack of enthusiasm and care by the staff,  that we usually receive at other hotels in the 5 star range, so as far as the staff goes there is a lot to improve. Another time we were sent to the wrong floor after asking for a restaurant. Seriously? Most noteably were the snacks we had over drinks  after dinner upstairs in Skyview Bar. I forgot what exactly it was that I ate, some type of asian sushi style snack that was served with the drinks. I didn't know how to keep it down, as I didn't want to spit it out into my napkin. It tasted like old fish. I still remember the taste. Gross. Again: unacceptable for a hotel that is said to be a 7star property. All in all we enjoyed our stay but these incidents literally left a 'bad taste' in my mouth.","4","2015-04"
"Disapointed by Valet Parking","Hotel is amazing. Staff in hotel and restaurant are very co-operative. Food is  delicious. but

Disapointed only with the behave of valet parking staff. Very rude and have no sense that how to treat guest. 

Valet staff need to be trained under educated and experienced manager.

Hope management will must take action on it.

Thanks","1","2015-08"
"Could not resist","Staying at Malaika Villa in June and decided to spend one afternoon to have tea at the Burj. The description of ""the menu rivals the very best in the world"" was a fair reflection of what to expect.
Having had the perfect experience it would have been wrong not to try a stay for my 15th wedding anniversary. Looking forward to my five night stay on the 12th August. No doubt the review will be all thumbs up when i return.","5","2015-06"
"Unforgettable","Boy is this place expensive, but boy is it worth it.

Probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in - it really is on another level and justifies it's 7 star rating.

They knew our names when the door was opened on our car, they checked us in early straight away, I'd told them in advance it was my girlfriends birthday and they brought us a complimentary cake (and a team of butlers all came in singing to her) and gave us an amazing room on the 24th floor.

The hotel is the best at every level. The rooms take your breath away, and the service is second to none.

It's so expensive, but it will be an unforgettable experience.","5","2015-07"
"Outrageous cost but has to be done...once!","We went for my wife's 'special' birthday as a stopover en route to the Seychelles. It was a £1k night indulgence as we had to change planes in Dubai and might as well stay at the top hotel. Considering we had a 'cheap' suite it was absolutely fabulous and you'd get bore if I told you why. The bottom line is that everything was well thought out and every need pre-empted. Highlights were the butler managing to call in a favour and getting us a reservation at the Aquarium restaurant which was fully booked, and not a table tucked away in a corner either, one right next to the glass. The birthday cake they provided FOC and the cake box to transport it the next day. The hotel switching the breakfast to the day we arrived rather than the day we left as we left very early. The cold water, ice creams and chilled popcorn which kept appearing at the side of our sunbeds by the pool. The full size designer cosmetics in the bathroom and the miraculous toothbrush that disappeared and was replaced by a new one after each time I used it without me ever seeing anyone doing it!
Would I stay here again? Absolutely not! Am I glad I went? Absolutely - no question!","5","2014-12"
"Romantic and beautiful view.","A beautiful building on the inside as well as the outside. We had some drinks and snacks at the sky bar one evening. Pricey but worth the splurge. Fantastic views of the city, great cocktails and wine varieties and great food on offer. Service excellent. A very nice evening.","5","2015-07"
"An experience!","The hotel is an amazing property. It has the Wow factor all over the place. Service is beyond belief. It felt like staff had a policy to never say No. Rooms are the biggest I have seen for an entry level room. They pamper you from the pickup we had in their luxury cars to the last goodbye. It is the best service I have experienced. You have to put your mind set that everything is very expensive but all high quality. They are remodeling one of the pools and adding a new private beach. Don't forget to visit the SPA. Once again, an experience!","5","2015-08"
"Amazing stay. Amazing staff. Highest praise.","Wow. This hotel was on my husband bucket list and so, as part of his birthday treat, we stayed for x3 days in a panoramic suite. 
We have stayed many many times in Dubai and so are well used to fantastic quality rooms, food and service but the level here is sublime. I cannot praise each and every part highly enough. 
We were picked up by the Burj hotels own liveried Mercedes. Mohammed arrived on time, fully uniformed and with a bouquet of flowers for me, cold towels and water for the journey. He was cheerful and respectful without being obsequious. Our transfer and check in at Burj Al Arab was swift and friendly. Thats what we particularly loved about the Burj, at all times service was attentive but it was elegant and understated, not over the top at all which had been one of our concerns.
Our check in was done in the suite. We had booked a Panoramic suite which overlooked both the gulf and also the coastline towards the Burj Khalifa. Incredible. I almost cried when they showed us the suite. It was huge with a beautiful sweeping staircase. I won't describe in detail all the fittings suffice to say I could wax lyrical for pages. The room, like the hotel, was immaculate. Everything was tended to with an eye for detail and lots of finishing touches.
We booked the summer special offer which included the transfers to and from the airport, breakfast and dinner each day, x1 spa treatment each and full size Hermes toiletries each to take away worth approx £120 each set. I felt that it was incredibly well priced and we left vowing to return.
We ate in the Pan Asian restaurant Junsul which we particularly enjoyed. The staff in there were so friendly and gave lots of advice and recommendations for food to try.
The poolside drinks and dining service along with the pool staff were fantastic. In fact everyone we met at the Burj were incredibly friendly and every single member of staff knew our name and which suite we were in. Incredible. It made us feel welcome and special, as if they appreciated our patronage, not indifferent to us in any way. 
I would really recommend going for the panoramic suite. We saw the slightly smaller suites and they are still large and beautiful but the panoramic were much bigger and not too much more expensive.
We had breakfast and dinner once in Bab Al Yam restaurant which is a world buffet. Great choices and great food although breakfast was full and very noisy. 
One morning we had breakfast in our room. I have to say that this was one of the most romantic things we have ever done. The dining table overlooking the ocean was set by our butler and we were served the most delicious choice of food whilst we sat in our fluffy towelling robes and memory foam slippers. Idyllic, and isn't that what holidays are all about?
We used the indoor pool too. Wow its beautiful and so far up the building! amazing views and very luxurious. 
We used the spa for our included treatment and both of us had fantastic therapists in the most beautiful rooms. At no time were we rushed and afterwards were encouraged to use the other facilities including the jacuzzis and private pools. There is the unisex jacuzzi and pool but also separate male and female pools and jacuzzis. The changing facilities with robes and slippers and lockers were beautiful and all immaculately clean.
My husband loves a gym and thoroughly enjoyed this one. It had modern equipment, great instructors and both cv and weight equipment. It was a large gym with excellent air con.
We were transferred back to the airport with Mohammed in his Mercedes once again. What a lovely chap.
If I had to be REALLY picky I would say that the TV in our room had a bit of colour loss. The dressing table area in the dressing room needs some more plug sockets and that the dressing room needs some drawers. I hated not having drawers to put underclothes into.
Yes its expensive to stay here and we couldn't have done it without the special offer but we left feeling that it had been well worth the money. We thought that maybe we would find the service a little too obsequious and that the hotel staff would treat us with indifference as were not as wealthy as those that arrive with an entourage or a helicopter but we should not have worried. It takes quite some training to get your staff to deliver consistent professional service. Well done. 
It was a trip which we presumed that we would make just the once, but no. Now we are hooked and planning our next stay.","5","2015-06"
"Truly 7 stars","We stayed at the Burj for 2 nights and everything about our experience was amazing
From the moment we walked into the hotel to the moment we checked out my customer service expectations were always exceeded
Congratulations to the HR department that hires the staff and the training department that continued to deliver excellence in customer service and experience
Loved every minute of our stay and we in Australia can learn so much from the team behind the burj al arib ","5","2015-08"
"Afternoon Tea in the Skyview -27th Floor","Fantastic service with tremendously efficient and knowledge staff who did their uptmost to ensure we had a great time; fantastic location with everything around the Burj Al Arab just oozing luxury and quality.

The food was excellent - potentially too much as often happens in this part of the world but we all did justice to it, with the selection of drinks available being more than we could have wished for.

The price is not cheap but the whole experience is one of high quality and as it is not something you do every day then the price is worth paying for the experience.","5","2015-08"
"High Tea at the Burj Al Arab /jumeriah","Simply Fantastic !
We were spoilt for 3 hours in the afternoon.
The service was just above and beyond. The food was so delicious.
I can't recommend this enough if your want to get pampered and spoil yourselves in dubai.","5","2015-07"
"Issues but dealt with well.","Stayed with family during Ramadan.

Meet and greet very good but could have done with more info on off site activities such as wild wadi.

TV didn't work - required 3 visits to floor concierge to get sorted - not seven star service.

Room very comfortable but slightly over the top for our taste.

Empty glasses left outside room for whole day.

Complained to management about floor service and their response was excellent.

In my opinion over rated but what the hell it is one of life's 'must do' experiences.","4","2015-06"
"High tea","Great hotel stunning views ,had high tea at the sky bar ,cost was $200 per person ,includes 1 glass of champagne,service was great but food was very disappointing. Sandwiches were mass made and not that fresh ,was expecting something outstanding ,but very average ,scones and cakes seemed to be laying around for a while before they got to us ,jams had a skin on them ,overall nothing was fresh at all ","2","2015-08"
"Perfection","Stayed seven nights at Burj Al Arab recently. I have stayed here several times before but never reviewed it before now. The service I received on my latest visit was no different from the previous ones.

From the moment I was collected at Dubai airport until the moment I was dropped off again the hotel staff go out of their way to look after you and make sure the reputation of Jumeirah and Burj Al Arab is maintained. 

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who are always friendly, efficient and willing to go above and beyond to ensure you have a perfect experience. I won't describe the hotel or suite fixtures as they have been described many times before in previous reviews and I found no issues with these during my stay. The hotel adds so many little extra touches which are too many to mention but altogether they add up to make your day much more special. 

The thing I like most about B A A is the exclusivity. You can't just wander in off the street into the hotel unless you are an in-house guest or have a restaurant reservation. During our stay we had breakfast in Bam Al Yam, dinner in Al Iwan, Junsui and Al Mahara and afternoon tea in the Sky Bar. The service in all these was excellent and food was of an extremely high quality. The staff remember you and your likes and dislikes from previous visits and accommodate these on subsequent visits without you having to ask or make them known.

The pool and private hotel beach are very quiet and the added touches like chilled water sprays, ice lollies, popcorn and even cleaning your sunglasses regularly are excellent and what I would expect a hotel of this magnitude to offer. 

The butler service is excellent and nothing is too much trouble for them, from simple dinner reservations to assisting you with more complex queries they really are excellent. The daily evening amenities you receive is superb. Each night the butter will bring a small 'treat' for you to enjoy which adds to the ambience of staying in this hotel. If you are celebrating a special occasion do make sure you inform the hotel when you book as you will receive a little extra treat!

Yes the hotel is very expensive in comparison to other hotels and suites cost upwards of approx £1,000 a night, however I feel this makes Burj Al Arab more exclusive and quieter than other hotels and adds to the ambience and enjoyment. If price is an issue for you don't stay here, otherwise enjoy the Burj Al Arab lifestyle for as long as you can! This is my fourth stay here and will not be my last!","5","2015-07"
"Evening cocktails ","I booked the skyview bar for the 25th July using the hotels email. I told them it was for my anniversary and requested a window table. We arrived about 30 mins prior to the booking and had a chance to look around. The hotel is opulence itself! The concierge remembers what order you arrive in so if you request a window table and arrive early you are more likely to get one. The staff are extremely attentive and said congratulations on our anniversary as soon as we arrived on the 27th floor. The appetisers were great and the cocktails were amazing. Dubai Dream was a favourite! We had 3 different cocktails each and the bill came to 915 AED - 1000 inc. service so cost approximately £200.  Yes it's costly but for us a once in a lifetime experience so highly recommended. We were even presented with a rose and beautiful cake to share! ","5","2015-07"
"Entry Denied ( To a Hotel )","What a disgrace this place is. I have been before ( 2004 ) and had to pay $100+ to use the beach with a small snack. ( Very forgettable Experience ) 3 weeks ago on an extremely hot day we were denied entry to the place. What are you promoting in Dubai and who do you think you are denying paying customers entry.. You use you thug traffic control idiots to turn people away ( no conversations entered into ) We were going to have lunch there. We will never return to this place again. Disgraceful behaviour.","1","2015-07"
"Luxury is an understatement - Welcome to the Great Gatsby Affair!","This is worthy of a sharp and succinct review but i'll keep it brief and impactful.

This place is nothing less than spectacular, its confines are inviting, welcoming and screams paradise. I expected it to be quite normal but boy was I wrong. It earned my respect and it was an awe-inspiring moment the second it came within my sights. Its proximity is consoling and gives you the sense of complete privacy. From the fleet of S-Classes, lambos and Phantoms, to the entry into the Grand Lobby. To the golden lifts, aquarium dining that overlooks the whole Palm Jumeirah and the remarkable, super exceptional service of the personal butler on call 24/7, the Panoramic views overlooking all of Dubai to the Hermes toiletries - this place is bucket list worthy. Do not even try to compare.

If you want to know what it feels to be a King or Queen, make reservations at the Burj Al Arab. 

If you play Starcraft 2 - Think Protoss. Only for the Elite.

The Burj Al Arab is why the word WOW was created.","5","2015-07"
"Burj Al Arab Jumeirah","Fantastic building, top of the range shops and restaurants.  As I have a dislike of sky scrapers,  we didn't go to the top. We have never seen the need for such expensive accommodation as we usually spend all our days out sightseeing then only want a clean and comfortable bed in which to rest.","5","2015-04"
"Dream hotel","Stayed in the club suite unbelievable to detail even had a full size snooker table .we were on the 20th floor with fantastic views .Service was outstanding throughout our stay,that we couldn't help,but just had to stay an extra night .Can not fault anything about the hotel,a must ,must stay ........can't wait to go back ASAP","5","2015-07"
"out of this world experience cannot give it enough praise","Absolutely perfect and amazing hotel and experience.  Can see why it is 7 star, loved every minute being here and didn't want to leave.  From being met at the airport by the meet and greet service where we didn't have to even carry our hand luggage to then being fast tracked through security and the team even collecting our luggage.  We were then met by the Phantom Rolls Royce outside and the service was outstanding.  We were given a menu for the music we wanted by our driver and driven to the hotel.  We were greeted by ladies with cool flannels and a nice cool drink as it was 50 degrees outside.  Shown to our room and introduced to our butler who was great, we felt like we were dreaming.  This hotel is very expensive but we can understand why, you are treated with so much respect and it doesn't feel forced or false.  We would leave our room and get in the lift and by the time we got down to breakfast, the butler had phoned the restaurant to tell them we were on our way so they greeted us by our names.  The pool was lovely, considering the heat it was lovely and cool, the breeze from the sea made sunbathing possible as did the butler service around the pool supplying ice cold flannels, large towels, very cool water and face spritzer.  The staff were so accommodating and friendly, I even got to try on the 8 carat diamond ring and 56 carat diamond necklace in the jewellery shop.  The deluxe suite was bigger than our house and furnished so lavishly, and the massage was excellent too.  The toiletries were Hermes and all complimentary, I am never one to take all the freebies from a room but I just couldn't help myself here.  I cannot fault anything about this hotel except that I am gutted I will need to win the lottery to stay here again.","5","2015-06"
"Amazingly Beautiful Place and Photo's do not do it Justice","I had a dream to stay and was lucky enough to be able to realise this dream and I am so happy that it exceeded my expectations in every way. 

From our very smooth check-in to the amazing service by Jaffers our butler we really had an amazing time. 

Everyday there was fresh fruit placed in our room and in the evening time we were offered a drink and a salt or sweet snack, it was lovely to have these little surprises delivered to our room prior to dinner. 

I also loved the little surprises that they left on our bed in the evenings instead of chocolates ... it was like santa had arrived. 

The view from our suite was just awesome and I could not have asked for more which was great. 

I also loved the beautiful toiletries placed in the room every evening these were hermes and we were even given aftershave and perfume which was a delight.

They room has a beautiful tea and coffee making facility along with an imac and gold ipad for use in the room. 

Breakfast in Bab al Yams was brilliant and I really loved the mini wagyu steaks, abundance of fresh berries and chocolate flakes to go with my coffee.... there really was nothing we could think off to add to this great selection of food and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. 

Dinner in Al Muntaha was a lovely experience which I would recommend as the views were exceptional and the atmosphere is electric. There was a very wide selection on offer and I don't usually deviate from the menu but i asked for something not on the menu this was a mistake as I did not enjoy what I decided to have, however the restaurant manager quickly resolved my issue and for this I'm truly grateful and will encourage me to return. My husband has the most beautiful dessert made with apple which he is still raving about today. 

The pool boys were great and really looked after us all week with cold water, towels, smoothies, lolly's, popcorn and cold towels. We really could not have asked for better. 

If i was to give one piece of constructive feedback it would be: one afternoon we decided as residents of the hotel to go to the sky bar enjoy the view's this offers in the daytime and get a few wee pics for our memories. However we were welcomed to sit on stools at the bar and could not avail of the many empty tables due to the service of afternoon tea. I found this to be most unwelcoming and a little unfair to a client that could be paying as much as £800 per night to stay there whilst the afternoon tea guests were getting priority... this needs to be resolved. 

All in all my experience was amazing staying in this great big sail in the sea and I think one day I will be back.","5","2015-07"
"Mere superlatives cannot describe......","Yes, the service I experienced at the Burj Al Arab exceeded the service I've exerienced in any other hotel, and I've stayed in some great hotels around the world. The hotel is beautiful, in an arabic manner. My room (a panorama suite) was spread over two levels, with every amenity you could imagine.
The hem on my good trousers had dropped, so the butler repaired it for me (no charge). Somehow the staff found out that it was my birthday, so after I'd finished my room service steak, they arrived with a beautifully decorated chocolate cake (regrettably I was checking out that night and couldn't finish it).
The room was in fact so comfortable that, on the first day, I didn't bother to venture out.
Was joined by a friend for a degustation meal in the Al Mahara restaurant and mere superlatives cannot adequately describe the outcome.","5","2015-06"
"Anniversary","Everything was perfect from service to panaromic views,best in room complimentary breakfast service to hotel ammenities.i was staying at one of their panaromic suites.the only thing that was really not upto their standards was their technology.its getting really old they need to make some changes about that.as they say 'most luxurious hotel in the world'.they need to make some upgrades to keep that standards up.","4","2015-04"

"Luxurious weekend","My friend and I decided for a staycation during the Eid holiday weekend.  As we have already tried a number of hotels in UAE, Burj Al Arab was one of those in our bucket list.  We have been here for dinner and drinks but haven't stayed here yet.  So we decided to have a go at this time.

1.  Check-in - We checked-in at around 12::00nn.  We're glad we were allowed to check-in early.  The staff took us to our room and that's where they did all the formalities.  Each floor had its own Reception and a ""butler"" was assigned to take care of us. From the time we arrived, all the staff that we met were very friendly and accommodating.

2.  Room tip - At the time of booking, we requested for a room in a higher floor.  We were given a room on the 19th with a view to the Palm.

3. Room amenities - The room/suite was huge.  It was 2 level.  The decor was traditional and ornate, and you see gold and mirrors everywhere.  Though it might not be our taste, but you couldn't deny that it looked royal.  The first level had a toilet, work desk with a Mac and printer, seating area with a big sofa, TV, mini bar, dining table.  On the 2nd level (spiral staircase going to 2nd level) was the bedroom, bathroom with a round jacuzzi and separate shower area.  The fittings were gold-plated.  Toiletries...there was a complimentary Hermes perfume!  There were more than enough closet space and a boudoir.  The bed was so soft and comfortable.  I could have slept the whole day.  Oh, there was a mirror on the ceiling.  A remote control was provided to not only control the TV but the curtains as well, open/close doors and a button for the butler.  Every day, they also gave us some treat.  Cake, fruits etc.  And they gave us foot lotion during the turn down service.

4.  Food - Breakfast was included in the room rate.  It was a buffet and reasonable food selection.  It was just okay.  We expected more, like compared to Al Qasr, Mina or even Jumeirah Beach Hotel.  The area overlooked the pool and had view of the sea.  We didn't try the room service nor the restaurants in the hotel itself, as there were better options in the area.  We went to the Skyview Bar for a night cap.  Service was as usual great.

5.  Hotel amenities - we tried the spa and the indoor pool (quite small compared to other hotels).  There was a separate section for ladies. It was on the 18th floor and the view was amazing!  The beach area was shared with the Madinat.  A buggy could take you there.

6.  Check-out was fast, no issues.  Staff were as friendly and charming when we came in and when we checked out.","5","2015-07"
"What a FABULOUS place","Was here with a friend its a fabulous place so grand  The aquariums just amazing food great expensive but worth every penny staff couldnt do enough for us  a place i may never go again but a place always to remember","5","2015-02"
"Lost it's sparkle","We stayed at the Burj a couple of years ago and had a flawless, faultless stay at what we would then have called one of if not the best in the world by far.

Unfortunately things seem to have slipped. The suites and butlers were outstanding and the general service levels are still very good (especially the doormen who always sort everything out for you with effortless ease).

There is some construction work going on just beyond the Burj by where the pool is and on arrival our butler informed us both the pool and the adjacent restaurant, where breakfast is normally served, were closed. This was particularly annoying as we had not been informed when booking and as we arrived mid afternoon we were keen to get out in the sun by the pool. As is it turned out it was also untrue! While there was some exploratory work going on (they're building something there shortly I believe) both the pool and the adjacent restaurant both remained open throughout our stay. Such a basic mistake to misinform guests.

The service at the beach was terrible. Perhaps that's a little harsh as there was virtually no service at the beach (and therein lies the problem). The Burj beach is no longer the exclusive experience it once was, now crammed in between the Jumeriah Beach Executive beach and its normal one, their rest rooms are now part of one of the restaurant's (previously there was a dedicated facility for Burj guests). Gone is the pleasant, relaxing exclusive experience you used to receive from a supposed 7 star hotel. Where the beach was Jumeirah are cramming another hotel inbetween the Burj and Madinat (clearly 5 in a row is not enough!).

Once unbelievable. Now sadly not. I doubt we will bother going back.","4","2015-07"
"This is a bucket list hotel","Most people reviewing this hotel have not actually stayed here, but have visited a restaurant or the bar. Let me be clear, our 4 nights here were mind blowing. It's everything you expect and then more.  The rooms are huge and opulent, the views incredible, the food world class, but what really blew us away were the staff.  From attentive butlers, to enthusiastic cooks, to the private dining team, everyone genuinely seemed to delight it making the stay outstanding. And they did.  The full size ammenities alone make the stay worth the extra you pay.  Every night there was a treat, from a birthday cake and bunch of roses, to the toy cart, laden with toys and treats for our daughter.  You can expect all the things you ask other hotels to provide to be in the room waiting. Then things that you hadn't even thought off to be there as well. We will start saving immediately to go back. Expect 7 star because you will get it.","5","2015-07"
"Best but almost too much!!","Stayed here one night. Incredible! Own butler two floor room. Everything was incredible. Pool is great and also the restaurants. The room it self needs a whole page to describe. As a swede it almost get a bit too much. After the pool they try your bath cloths whole you take a whirlpool with some herbs !?!? All over the hotel they know your name!?!? Crazy but fun experence!!","5","2015-07"
"amazing Burj","Most amazing hotel in the world! Only a one night stay but made to feel like a vip every step of the way. Dont get me wrong, its not cheap but we got what we paid for and more. 
Check in was in the room and early. Staff could not have done more, (Natalia Vinuela worked extra hard to make our stay perfect)
Sky bar is well worth the trip, great view and drinks.
Will visit again if the overtime allows it.","5","2015-07"
"Unhappy Stay in Panoramic Suite","I went to Burj Al Arab to celebrate my first wedding anniversary, thinking it is going to be a very special stay. But unfortunately it wasn't special at all. The Burj Al Arab website gives you false information about the amenities and services you are going to get with your suite, in my case it was the Panoramic Suite.  Starting from the 24k gold plated ipad, Full set of full size Hermes amenities for him and her. Free massage discount coupon of AED150 and evening in suite snacks and beverages. Other than this the hotel bathroom amenities are really few and not up to the standards of such hotel. For example there are no shaving kit, no body lotion, no earbuds, no mouthwash and many more things that you even find in 4 stars hotels. 

To end it up i didn't get a turndown service for my suite, until i called at around 9:30pm and asked them to do it for me. And the shock was that they thought that the turndown service was already done for my suite...... How come such a luxurious hotel doesn't have a proper system to know what is done and what is not done.

The worst thing is that i gave them my feedback and no one even bothered to contact me from the hotel side.","1","2015-07"
"Afternoon Tea... an experience not to miss","OK, I have been twice now for afternoon tea, both times I thought it was fantastic plenty of food, great service by our waiter, and in our case, we were celebrating my Mothers Birthday, so they also brought a special birthday cake to the table, and a few waiters came over and sang happy birthday.
Along with the various subtle musicians playing, creating a lovely ambiance.
A great experience, but don't east before you get there.","5","2015-02"
"Grand as you get ","I have stayed here twice now and it has a stunning interior with gold plated everything. The service is what you expect from such a hotel like the Burj. It is a great experience but comes at a price.my second visit was still great but had the feeling been there done that got the t-shirt. ","5","2015-01"
"Majestic building..","Worth a visit u to to Dubai.. U can easily come here by cab with reasonable prices.. But as usual Dubai was really hot m according to our cab's driver the temperature in Dubai will be more hotter with average 42 Celsius degrees and max 52celcius degrees in July n Ogos.. So be prepare with sun block cream and some protection cream.. Haha.. Make sure to wear hat or head cover while walking around under the hot weather to avoid getting heat stroke.. For those who love the burning sun light then this is the perfect place for hang out.. Overall The building was nice n the view also great.. ","4","2015-06"

"Planning to Have My 50Th. Birthday party with 50 guests.","Myself and 3.friends flew into Dubai especially to visit BAAJ as we were planning my 50th Birthday which is in Aug 2015. We were met by a fleet of Pristine white Rolls Royce's , 2 for us and 1 for our luggage. The drive through Dubia in our cavalcade of RR caused quite a stir people obviously thinking Saudj Royalty or some world leader but no just us. 
The site of the BAAJ was amazing especially knowing my planes for everyone of my 50 guests will be arriving via helicopter which we would experience for ourselves on our trip back to the airport. Whilst I had seen the external design and structure I wasn't quite prepared for the outrageous opulence of the interior with it's huge atrium reaching for the Gods made in honeycomb style shapes with deepest blue and gold leaf everywhere, it was breathtaking but actually looked a little over the top and very gaudy. Perfect for my party which is it's self going to be the ultimate bad taste party. We were whisked up in to our two suites which were huge, one of them was bigger than my friends small apt in London. 
They served us tea and warm little pastries in such a pretty but odd shaped pot ( see pic enclosed ) 
After we had freshened up we were given a grand tour of the hotel, the private rooms where my party would start following on into another room were it would all finish and gift hoodie bags given to all my guests  as they left  The high lite for me was the helipad and seeing the look on their faces as they disembark the helicopter  that high up as it's  a surprise for everyone. The rest of our stay we were waited on hand and foot by our own butler which was the icing on the cake. After we had finalized  all the detail we had Spa treatments, Dinners and our ultimate dept by helicopter from the apparently floating landing Deck Can't wait for my Birthday  landing deck","5","2014-08"
"High Tea","We went for High Tea that included filet steak ! It was an amazing experience. Opulent surroundings and attentive but unobtrusive staff. A meal of a life time in an architectural experience. No alcohol but interesting alternatives.","5","2014-10"
"Luxury but not really a Warm Welcome","Most reviews tell you this is luxury and it is without a doubt, i was very lucky to get this 2 nights in a flash sale and when you arrive at the hotel you are met and taken upto your own floor and to your room straight away with paperwork being done there and honestly you will go wow as you realise you have entered your room not another hotel lobby.
The breakfast was of very good quality but I have had 5 star hotels that have been better.
There are faults with this hotel like there would be in any hotel in the world :) we had a very rude member of staff at the pool one day and a few other tiny problems but overall this is sheer luxury and we loved our 2 nights but for us the luxury did come at a cost of relaxation as it was a bit too posh for us and we felt out of place and did not felt welcomed into the hotel, they were 100% professional but not warm with it, hard to describe but we would go back to Al Qasr in a heart beat but we both agreed a beautiful place but not for us.","4","2015-07"
"Elegant Hotel","We went for High Tea. This in itself was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. The service and surroundings were excellent. The lobby is definitely worth a look with its tropical fish and fountains.
However, it was very expensive - $160 au each. The high tea at the Meridien, where we were staying, was highly comparable at one quarter of the price.
Also the views were very limited due to the permanent heat haze in July.
Nice experience, but would not do it again.","4","2015-07"
"Excellent Hotel, but I would say 7 Star","This is now the second time we have stayed at the Burj Al Arab. My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary in style, so where else but here. We visited during Ramadan, and also during the Arabian summer, so price wise, the cost to stay was at one its lowest periods.
Check-in is on your room floor, no longer on the ground floor, where you are escorted around your 2-storey apartment/room. The rooms are amazing, and you can see why so many people would like to stay here. the lounge area is huge, enough seating for 10 people with TV. You have a small bar, and a study area equipped with iMac and printer. Off to one side of the room is washroom number 1.
Upstairs is your very large bedroom, with an amazingly comfortable bed. Don't be put off by the mirror on the ceiling. Prior to the bedroom, a ladies boudoir and enough closet space for a large family. Upstairs you will also find washroom number 2, with a large round jacuzzi bath and separate shower cubicle, all fittings finished in gold. 
For those who like Hermes, there is a large ladies and gents complimentary perfume, very nice.
For entertainment, there is a remote keyboard, which gives access to curtain open/close, TV, internet and sound system. We had some difficulty trying to operate the computer functionality.
Breakfast is included (not all hotels offer this), but I must say, other hotels put the Burj's breakfast in the shade. The choice is similar to most hotels, but we expected more. To be honest, my wife hardly ate anything.
All the staff are undoubtedly courteous, charming, friendly and helpful, and certainly don't hang around waiting for a tip which is quite refreshing (we do tip). Our maitre de was really helpful during our stay.
To be totally honest, the Burj Al Arab is definitely a place to visit once in your lifetime, but due to the excessive cost, I would say once would be enough for mere mortals. The views from the rooms are amazing.
Although this is a great hotel, I still I not sure why it is a 7 star. The hotel does NOT have a beach, you share with the Medinat, which you need to wait for a buggy to get you there and back. There is no large pool like most of the high-end hotels in Dubai. you cannot have much of walk outside around the hotel after dinner. Also, the interior of the hotel is small, not much to see. 
I must however say a really big thanks to the hotel and the staff, who, when they realised it was our anniversary, presented us with a beautiful cake, roses and some very delicious nibbles. Thank you all.","4","2015-06"
"Wnderful Dining Experience","Dined in the seafood restaurant and was taken on a wonderful journey that was reminiscent of a theme park ride to get there! On arriving we were taken through the reception area decorated with such opulence the bejewelled colours and gold plate hurt your eyes! 
Ken Hom cooked for us and as you would expect it was divine! The surrounding were amazing and certainly made you feel like you were dining under the sea,  which was the whole objective!","5","2014-08"
"Great View, Average Food in the Sky View Bar","Went for cocktails at the Sky View Bar.  We had a 7pm booking, but arrived at 6.30pm to have a wander around the foyer area.  We were seated by the window looking back at the city, rather than the Palm, which is best viewed from the restaurant.  The city view was still great, especially once it turns dark.  Service was very good and cocktails were nice, however the food was definitely not 7 star quality.  It was bad pub food at best.  Recommend the experience but be sure to eat beforehand.","3","2015-06"
"Excellent afternoon tea in the sky view bar","This afternoon tea is expensive ~gbp 110 pp but worth it when you realise how much food you will get. We had champagne, roast beef, a fruit refresher, loads of sandwiches, cakes, desserts, scones and unlimited tea. We were given so much food we couldn't finish it all and we hadn't had any lunch. It certainly is a larger afternoon tea than normal and everything is freshly prepared including the bread - we had 5 different types for our sandwiches (not your everyday bread either)!! The staff were fantastic, they couldn't do enough for us and at the end gave us a lovely gift each. My only grumble was the view was tainted because the windows in the sky view bar were filthy so you couldn't see very well outside and you couldn't really take any pictures of the view. Excluding this we had a wonderful time and will go again if we ever go back to Dubai.","5","2015-04"
"Afternoon Tea","I had afternoon tea here.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the service was absolutely fantastic.
We had afternoon tea in the SkyView Bar and had a window seat.  We had about 7 courses of food with them bringing more of anything that I wanted (ended up with about 5 extra courses of sandwiches which was great!)

The waiters were fantastic and told me lots of interesting information about the building, Dubai, and also interesting personal stories!

Definitely worth the money to come and visit this.  I would definitely do this again.","5","2015-07"
"AfternoonTea in The Skyview Bar","What a wonderful experience from arrival to departure. Having been greeted by security we took the small drive to the grand entrance of a place I'd only dreamed of visiting The Burj Al Arab. Having been greeted by immaculate concierge we we greeted inside by two beautifully dressed ladies who advised us to take our time looking around and when we were ready take the escalators to the first floor where we would then be shown where to go. Having taken a look around the beautiful jewellery shops on the next level we were guided toward the lifts and were taken up to The Skyview Bar.  We were personally welcomed and taken to our seats which were window seats overlooking Jumeirah Beach with a view where you could see for miles. We were served sparkling date juice (as it was Ramadan alcohol is not allowed) and fresh stuffed dates and we were guided through the menu. As each course was delivered on stands in the shape of the hotel, each item was described to us and it was casually asked if we were there for any special occasion, having mentioned it was my mums birthday soon and this was a treat, we continued to chat with the hostess, when the sweets and pastries were served the hostess came to my mum with a small celebratory cake and  beautiful red rose. As the afternoon tea came to an end the hostess came to us again with a small gift for each person. Having left the Skyview bar we took another look around and left. After a few photos against the hotel signage outside we decided to take the walk over the bridge taking in the views of the hotel and again some photos to security where we got a taxi. A wonderful afternoon and a time I won't forget. ","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon Tea","Afternoon tea was delicious, if a little pricey! 
Service was excellent, food presentation and taste were also excellent. I didn't like the duck course, so they were extremely considerate and gave me an alternative of marinated salmon which was very tasty! Overall, a lovely experience but at the price of it, it won't be happening very often! 
","4","2015-07"
"Indeed an example of customer service","From the moment that lovely Russian lady checked us in until our departure, Burj Al Arab has spoilt us with impeccable service and extra care. The suite is extremely spacious with the most amazing views. The most comfortable bed ever, Hermes amenities in the bathroom and the floor to ceiling windows are just several details that impressed us. Our butlers were very efficient with all our requests. We had dinner at the best Asian buffet in town, junsui, which while being pricey for a buffet restaurant, did live up to our expectations. The pretty ladies in blue dresses in the hotel lobby ensured our guests didn't get lost - we found it very thoughtful. Breakfast at the pool restaurant was a delight with beautiful sea view and a cool breeze. While we were sad about leaving the hotel, a Kenyan doorman entertained us while waiting for car. His friendly manner was a nice last touch. It was not the first time to stay in the Burj for one of my friends, yet he was equally impressed. A little tip - make sure you don't have any other plans while in Burj, it's a place to spend a full day. ","5","2015-04"
"Not meeting expectations","This hotel looks just marvellous, and in many respects it is. But we booked a table at the restaurant there (the one with the view), and despite being told that there was a strict dresscode, that all soft drinks were included in in the (rather stiff) couvert price we had to pay in advance, we ended up experiencing average service during dinner, guests who ran around in t-shirts and shorts between the dinnervtablea and ultimately ended up paying for the most expensive softdrinks ever consumed by any of us. Well worth the visit, but not not at all worth the dinner experience. Plenty of othe places in Dubai with better service!","2","2015-04"
"Kids room dull","#burjalarab is very nice. Grt spa, magnificent architecture, best of service, wow location  but it's kids room is really disappointing. Infact it's very dull little place. D dark spot in otherwise ideal oasis. Being on 18th floor, wonders can b done with d kids area. ","5","2015-06"
"Overpriced","The food was average! It was overpriced! I would never go there again. It was just a show of! Everything is supposed to be high scale, but they fail to reach the image they try to create. Don't go there! Just don't!","2","2015-04"
"High Tea","The most spectacular 7* High Tea. Whilst the view is a little obscured by the building dust on the horizon, High Tea on the 27th Floor is delectable with culinary treats and a stand in the shape of the Burj. The service is as though you are Royalty for those 2hours and it a most pleasant way to pas the sunset. It is expensive at 500Dirhams but I felt it was value for every cent - my 11yo was given the same food and only charged 50%. The visit to the hotel is a spectacle itself not to be missed and the cars in the driveway are top range so even the boys got a treat. Highly recommended when having a special occasion in Dubai.","5","2015-07"
"Cocktails at the sky lounge","Expensive. But we knew that and therefore expected it. The quality of the view, service and drinks was all exceptional. Expect to pay £200 for 6 extravagant, delicious, quality cocktails.

The venue oozes class. The only criticism i can muster is that the staff are maybe too serious and robotic. But when you go to a 7 star venue then you will usually experience this.

Overall i cant really fault this bar based on my experience there.","5","2015-07"
"Burj Luxury","Having just one night to stay at the Burj at the end of June to celebrate my 50th birthday we decided to opt for the culinary dining flight to enable us to experience as much of the world's most luxurious hotel as possible.  Having traveled during Ramadan we understood that alcohol would be restricted.  This was handled so well for guests whilst respecting religious tradition.  Our experience started at the Sky View Bar with a fabulous non-alcoholic sparkling apple beverage recommended to us by the bar team. A culinary flight taking in six different areas surely cannot be the easiest to co-ordinate - it was seamless from start to finish.  The delicious food and wonderful service surpassed our expectations.  Having started at 19:00 hrs and finishing around midnight we were able to dine at our own pace.  A delightful gift of a celebration birthday cake and roses were presented to me to top off the experience.  

Of course the rooms and amenities are luxurious.  It's the team that also stand out. The whole service from beginning to end at the Burj is warm and friendly.  From the moment you arrive, greeting at the entrance and checked in within your room to the moment of departure you feel cared for by the genuine and helpful team in all areas of the hotel.  

Thank you for making my special birthday so memorable.","5","2015-06"
"great hotel","splendid hotel. highly priced but never seen anything like it. customer sefvice is second to none. definately worth a trip especially to the sky bar. stayed for couple nights with rest of the week in Atlantis ","5","2015-02"
"Perfect","Had a perfect stay in one of there suites during one of my visits to the  UAE. The suite was clean, luxurious and everything was top. The staff was very friendly and the view is breathtaking. The food is good as well the overall service. The hotel is located in Jumeirah, just across Jumeirah beachtresort and near the Al Wahdi Waterpark.","5","2015-04"
"Seven Stars is not enough","When you arrive at the Burj Al Arab you immediately get the sense of Royalty. The first thing you notice upon arrival are the taxi's. The taxi's are now Mercedes, Lexus, Range Rovers etc. As you walk into the building the walls are lined with portraits of Kings and Princes. Once you enter the lobby you are entice by the Gold plated everything. The escalators are flanked on the sides with wall sized aquariums with a beautiful dancing water fountain between the escalators. The Concierge desk is staffed by a very friendly and professional staff. Everything about the hotel announces excellence and beauty from the dozens of flowers bouquets made up of miniature roses to the numerous Swarovski crystal pieces, to the vast array of colors and craftsmanship that went into the design of the hotel. Glass elevators take you to your floor were you will find your very spacious and luxurious room. Lying on the bed makes me wonder what lying on a cloud would be like. The rooms have beautiful views of Dubai and the Persian gulf. The hotel has several wonderful restaurants within but my favorite is the Al Muntaha which is at the very top of the hotel and is unbelievably gorgeous with the best food you will find anywhere.","5","2015-02"
"If you are seeking for a luxury vacation then, this is it","Burj Al Arab is the most luxurious hotel i have visited so far and most probably the most luxurious hotel in the world. I stayed in a mini suit which was no mini at all. There were two floors, with downstairs being a bathroom, the kitchen, some closets and the living room and upstairs the master bedroom, which was huge with a king size bed and the main bathroom. The bathroom products weren't the usual ones i typically find in hotels, but they were Hermes! Our room view was amazing and the hotel staff extraordinary. The indoor pool is just breathtaking, with high detail walls and a view of Dubai from above! The only thing i would change was the breakfast as it was a bit poor, but compared to everything else that was the least of my worries.","5","2014-08"
"The Most Luxurious Hotel in the World","I stayed at the Burj Al Arab from 4th July for 5 nights.   The hotel deserves its reputation as the finest in the World.  It rates exceptional in all categories - service, security, luxury, food, attention to detail, guest services, facilities, cleanliness, hospitality, professionalism, etc. etc....   Truly the finest place I have ever stayed and excellent in all areas...*******  Well deserved!!!   Top of top and worth every cent!!!","5","2015-07"
"WOW","For out 30th wedding anniversary and whilst on a stop over in Dubai we thought we would treat ourselves to an opulent night at the Al Arab. Wow, it was special, and we felt special. We had a butler and our own floor concierge. The suite was a 2 story  2 bedroom apartment ( upgrade from a 1 bedroom) which was probably ridiculous and bigger than our 5 bedroom, and study house in Australia. The bed was an $18,000 USA bed with I think 1000 thread Egyptian cotton and duck down pillows. I don't know if it was the bed and sheets or the flight from Australia but we slept like babies. The buffet breakfast was the best we have experienced with variety and quality. The free baklava and chocolates, wine, beach bag, Hermes aftershave/perfume etc was nice.  .The pool the free shuttle golf carts to the water park and private beach, the late check out the contacting and arranging the tours and cars for the airport etc were much appreciated - thanks allam and all the staff","5","2015-05"
"Average afternoon tea at the Sky View bar","I booked afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab’s Sky View bar for a birthday celebration for my sister. It was my second time here. The food was ok (it was better on my first visit ), but the staff were very friendly and gave us a little gift to remember the occasion.  

The only criticism I would make of the experience is that we were unable to walk around the entire bar/restaurant area to appreciate the full sea views (as I did last time) - they sectioned the restaurant off from the afternoon tea seating area even though it was closed. 

Also please be aware that when it comes to paying your bill, you have the option to pay in local currency or your home currency. When I questioned the exchange rate as I didn’t understand it - the member of staff was also confused by it, but informed me that “most people pay in their home currency”, don’t do this. The difference is small – around £10, but it’s better to pay in local currency. Basically I got stung by “Dynamic Currency Exchange/Conversion”.","3","2015-07"
"Experience Dinning and Service Excellence - Al Iwan Restaurant","My wife and I visited Al Iwan Restaraunt for the Ramadan iftar buffet, I have nothing but the best to say about the ambience, live themed music, the scrumptious homemade 7 star food (Soups, Salads, Mains and Sweets), I say homemade because no food is better than that which is made at home and when you combine ultimate chef expertise with homemade sensation cooked food nothing compares to the quality the restaurant has to provide.. and finally, the divine luxury surroundings. Truely a special place and highly recommended for food.","5","2015-07"
"7 star only in name","I went for a drink here when visiting Dubai out of curiosity , its not a 7  star by any means, you pay €75 if you want to go in this gets you 2 free cocktails and one plate of nibbles. Its not worth it you can only access this bar not the others, the Chinese obviously invested loads in it as its all Asian bar, restaurant. The cocktails were weak not mixed good, the calamari was raw. The stirrers cheap could not pick up the olives and size of napkin like face cloth. Looking outside the sun loungers looked every much as cheap. I felt I was in a hotel in Asia and not in middle east, Not worth the money","3","2015-06"
"Afternoon tea in Sky view Bar","The hotel itself is beautiful inside and out and from this point of view it lives up to expectations. 
The afternoon tea was over 7 courses and the carvery of the day and sandwiches were our favourite course but the cake selection/scones I thought were average and to be honest I have had better afternoon teas elsewhere although the creme brulee was very good.
As we were celebrating a special occasion we were given extras at the end.
The staff were very attentive and provided great customer service. 
I must admit if I returned I would book the Sky view bar just for drinks in the evening as I felt while the afternoon tea was a lovely experience it didn't quite live up to expectations and the hotel itself felt more like a tourist attraction.","4","2015-06"
"Recomended to visit once in a life time with your loved ones.","One of the excellent hotels and fine dining restaurants I have ever been, they have really set a par above the rest. Great place to be during period from November through Marc when the weather cools down. Must visit once in a life time with your loved ones.","5","2014-08"
"awesome","I was working in the UAE from 2007-2010.
Took my wife to afternoon tea. If you are thinking of going, make sure you book first as you cannot just rock up. The entry has security and they need to check your booking and car number. They will then let you through and when you get to the entry they will valet park your car.
Once inside its awesome. The decoration and fountain, the aquarium as you travel up the escalator. Roses in display urns set in squares. The atrium soars above you for the full height.
The afternoon tea was worth all the expense. We were going to make more visits but that was our ""been there done that"" day out. If you have the time and money visit it whenever you can.","4","2014-08"
"Suite was comfortable,and spacious,fantastic views","We had a one bedroom suite,and it was double floor. The service was sharp,with a personal butler. The Hermes products in the bathroom were appreciated. The spa bath and shower in master bathroom was stunning. The bed with the gold mirror on the ceiling and pop up TV with electric curtains was luxurious. The breakfast was tasty,especially the room service option.the pool was ok,the beach pool near Jumeriah were nicer,and certainly a tad cheaper for drinkys...this hotel is like a ""bucket list"" place to experience high class service.our 11 year old son enjoyed it here. We were not allowed to take him to the rooftop sky bar which was a little disappointing. Also the standard of free for the restaurant is high,no shorts,or jandals etc...","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon Tea :)","What an experience, a must for your to do list. Luxurious in every way,delicious treats, exquisite views, attentive service, a real treat. Nothing is too much trouble or effort. 
We will definitely go back and experience an over night stay of sheer luxury. They are currently making a beach for the hotel which should be finish in November 2015.","5","2015-07"
"High Tea","From the moment you walk in the entrance and are greeted with a smile you notice the pure opulence of the hotel and then guided to the escalator which takes you to the reception area to go to the Sky View Bar for afternoon tea. You enter a glass elevator which takes you up & once there you are greeted & escorted to a table which was near a window with a good view.
Service is outstanding with everything including the menu explained by the staff. It was Ramadan so no alcohol but the sparkling juice was great & kept being refilled & the food was excellent. You were also offered more sandwiches if you wanted them & the beautiful jams served with the scones were the best I have tasted. The cakes were delicious as was the Creme Brûlée and we were given a small gift at the end, it was a wonderful way to spend the afternoon.

It was expensive that is to be expected at this standard of hotel but it was worth it for the experience and enjoyment. People around us who were celebrating special events were also treated to extras.

An experience we won't forget.","5","2015-06"
"Stunning","My fiance and I couldn't decide where to stay in Dubai, so we split our time with 2 nights each at the Armani Hotel in the Burj Khalifa and 2 nights here.  It will never be a question again - the Burj al Arab lives up to the hype!

From the moment you arrive, you are swept up into their impeccable service.  No front desk, you are addressed by name, escorted right up to your room, and all arrangements are finalized there.  The rooms are 2 floors and very spacious.  Though traditional, ornate furnishings are not our usual taste, we could not deny the beauty of it all.  

We tried both the underwater restaurant and the one on the top floor.  The underwater restaurant, though pricey (everything is in Dubai, so just get used to it), was fantastic.  The food was simply beautiful.  We enjoyed post dinner cigars and drinks in the lounge after.  Great experience!

The upstairs restaurant was also good, but we made the mistake of going after it was already dark.  Definitely go when you can still enjoy the views!  We couldn't see a thing.

Service on the beach was also excellent.  As soon as you arrive, they bring you a small cooler of ice cold waters and chilled washcloths.  Perfect to beat the heat!  The best part of Dubai in general is the water - it is warmer than a bath!  My only (minor) complaint is that we did have to wait a while for the shuttle to/from the beach, perhaps because it was the end of the day so things were winding down.  We just got so spoiled by the rest of the service that I felt this could be a little smoother.

This was my second time in Dubai.  I don't love it (it is basically one expansive and expensive shopping mall connected to another), but we are already planning another stop on our next trip to the region just so we can stay at the Burj again!","5","2014-09"
"Afternoon tea","Visited this place for an afternoon tea to celebrate our anniversary and it's worth every penny. The place is magnificent. Food was pricy as you would expect on this kind of hotel but the surrounding was very clean, service was excellent and food was superb. Pure luxury!","5","2014-12"
"Simply the best","We have stayed six times here now and it simply cannot be beaten. The staff are not allowed to say no which becomes a bit of a game in the end. The pool at the rear although small is never crowded and you are attended to all day whilst sun bathing, from having your sunglasses cleaned to ice creams being delivered. The private beach/pool is shared with one of the other jumeira hotels so can get a little busy but never rammed.
In terms of room choice the standard suit is more than adequate the next upgrade being the club suite which boasts your own pool table.
Final tip would be to arrive by helicopter, when your spending this amount it seems silly not to indulge in the ultimate transfer.","5","2014-11"
"Burj Al Arab","We booked into this hotel for what my wife calls a baby moon, a spot of indulgence with Jumeirah after enjoying a fantastic stay at the Zabeel Saray in 2014.
The hotel's appearance on the outside is matched on the inside. Aside from a small issue with those who service our room, this hotel lives upto every expectation. You Get privacy, superb service and a chance to make memories and relax in absolute decadence. Hard to fault the hotel in any way, obviously not in everyone's budget range, but I will definitely return. The gym is fantastic and squash court is in perfect condition. Restaurants serve the best food and wine, if you twisted my arm I could probably live here!!!","5","2015-07"
"A Hotel By Which All Others Can Be Judged!","This is the hotel against which to judge all others.

It is expensive however you would expect it to be. That said the level of service was simply outstanding as was our suite, the public rooms and every other aspect of the place.

If you get a chance to stay, stay.

A note on the few negative reviews, I do struggle to believe those that say they have complained. We did have a small issue during our visit which when the staff realised what had happened was dealt with promptly and effectively.

If your not happy, complain & if the person you speak to does not give you satisfaction then complain again to someone else, they will listen!","5","2015-06"
"Really awesome evening in the Skyview Bar!","WE made reservations in advance for the Skyview Bar, for 7PM,  were escorted one couple at a time in the glass elevators to the top, seated at a window table, and watched an amazing sunset on my 6oth birthday. Ramadan, so no alcohol until 8, but they served us water and juice and a complimentary platter of appetizers. We ordered the sliders and the shrimp, plenty, and  cocktails at 8PM. Gorgeous place and views. Get there before dark, and get a table with a view of the city, not just the ocean. Amazing hotel.  Arrive 30 minutes in advance to tour the hotel - worth it!","5","2015-06"
"""On Cloud Nine""","Make no mistake;this is a very special place which gives guests their own very special space;a hotel like no other with staff who are more like familiar friends and a quality of service far and above anything I have experienced elsewhere......when it came time to leave I realised that I will return for sure;thanks to all at the Burj for making our stay such a memorable one....","5","2015-06"
"Luxurious holiday","Fantastic beautiful hotel . Service is the best . Rooms are dublex, massive and luxurious ,beautiful view of persion gulf in the lounge and the bedroom , the toiletries are Hermes . The staff are very polite and helpful . Food is not as luxurious as the rest . Over all the hotel is the best as they say .","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon Tea at Burj Al Arab","An absolute must. Window seat in the Sky View Bar. Every single course in the Afternoon Tea was spectacular and very much worth the money. Waited on hand and foot as you would expect from the worlds 7 star hotel. The staff made my 25th birthday a spectacular day. Thank you. ","5","2015-06"
"Worth the splurge for a few nights","It's beautiful. Stunning. Impressive. Unlike anything I've ever seen. Great service all around - butlers were attentive and responsive. Room service was excellent - prompt and absolutely delicious. Indian curry was fabulous. We enjoyed the beach and the water park, and the indoor pool - all absolutely worthy of 7-star status. I couldn't take my eyes off the lobby!!!! I can't imagine our trip to Dubai would have been the same had we stayed anywhere else.
Breakfast is wonderful - everything you could want, beautiful, and fresh. Loved having iMac in the room, and fresh fruit and baklava. Lovely little goodnight gifts at Turndown. Loved having 2 floors and 2 bathrooms in such an elegant space.

My only thing is that the food at the restaurants is very overrated. We went to the fine dining restaurant the first night and did not think it was memorable or that we really liked anything we tasted. Spinach was overcooked and oversalted, the salmon cerviche was not cerviche. My husband enjoyed his scallop though. The decor there and Sky Bar is very outdated. (Drinks and snacks at Sky Bar were great, however,)
We later did the Culinary Feast, an expensive and laborious trip through all 6 restaurants at the hotel. Our food was far from spectacular. The settings were over-the-top (like a less impressive version of any restaurant in a Las Vegas 4 or 5 star hotel) and the food was mediocre .  We were not impressed with the choices or quality - a vegetarian couscous dish was nothing special, an egg roll was greasy and inedible. We loved the setting at the restaurant with the aquarium, but the tables around us weren't set, one was dirty, and the whole thing felt like an afterthought, like they weren't trying. We wished that instead of the culinary feast (which staff told us was an amazing experience) that we'd done either the Asian Buffet or the Middle Eastern buffet so we could have found foods we enjoyed more.","5","2015-06"
"Not to be missed","This hotel is amazing!  Our suite was 2 levels with floor to ceiling triple paned windows. The staff new that we had a child with us so an employee with a kid cart showed up and did a puppet show and gave sweets and small toys to my son. Our butler took care of our room and belongings. Had our clothes for dinner pressed and ready. Food offerings are supurb. They cater to you at this hotel unlike any other place I've ever been. The spa is a must visit along with the top floor infinity pool. I cannot say enough about our experience here.","5","2014-10"
"must experience tea at  BAA","very much enjoyed the afternoon tea, which exceeded our expectations. service was excellent.we were with a tour group, so did not have time to ""exlore"" and appreciate the architectural aspect of the hotel.","5","2015-06"
"truly amazing","stayed here for 1 night just to say we did - got upgraded to a better room for free ... incredible

the view is one thing, but the room itself is something else - hot tub, full size snooker table, full size kitchen, personal butler service, the list goes on.

appreciate the room is expensive, but what do people expect. a once in a lifetime stay for the majority of people, and it will not disappoint","5","2015-06"
"Sky bar afternoon tea","Nothing amazes me by the hotel, can tell it is ageing as other hotels are overpowering. Afternoon tea on the 27th floor sounded marvellous, although let down by the small room we were in, expected a lot more. Nice views across the jumeirah Palm, couldn't fault food and staff were fantastic also very friendly. As I said, we were Slightly disappointed upon the small room which was barely anything fancy and majorly overpriced.","3","2015-06"
"Pure luxury","After recently staying at this hotel I cannot fault it at all. 

The attention to detail is just amazing and no expense is spared.

From the welcome in to the hotel to the fare well you are treated like a king.

The rooms were amazing and what you would expect and more. 

With the suite being on 2 levels this split everything up nicely and it felt like a home away from home.

The mirror above the master bed was questionable but each to their own! 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

Not one issue with this place and will certainly be back for another stay.","5","2015-02"
"Stunning","Amazing hotel simply breathtaking> Only went there for dinner but was phenomenal. the food was amazing. they cooked my fish from scratch on the barbecue style cooker. Stunning view and excellent service","4","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea","We visited the Berj Al Arab for afternoon Tea which was a fantastic experience and is served in the 27th floor Sky Lounge, which was beautiful, with a fantastic view of the City and the Palm. The 7 course afternoon tea was delightful and varied with 23 different teas to chose from along with any kind of Coffee you wish and sparkling wine as well.","5","2015-06"
"Amazing views and Service","Unique location and incredible views of the Palm.  Service beyond compare.  From arrival, to the amazing details in the restaurant. Cocktail selections in the bar were very unique and fun!  Great mixologist","5","2015-06"
"Amazing","Breathtaking views, service was phenomenal. Very pleasant visit.  Staff were very attentive and more thqn hapoy to help. Decor was absoloutley stunning. Food was 5 star. Even the lobby lounge had so much class to it. I would highly recomend this to anyone who wants to have a luxurious trip away. Thank you","5","2015-06"
"'Luxury with a breathtaking view '","My dad treated my Mum & I to afternoon tea in the Sky view bar. Seven star hotel with Seven star service!! Greeted with a smile while on the Private elevator. The Bar is opulent without being distasteful. Fine Bone china & some lovely touches make it very special. The food was exquisite, the service was 2nd to none and the View was Wow! 
My mum had some dietary requirement and nothing was too much trouble.
Expensive but worth every penny!","5","2015-06"
"Highly recommended","All I can say is  wow, amazing and very top service, everything is perfect. Specially d rooms is very clean and nice view. And d foods is so delicious. We will surely we will come back! Still hangover.  Thankyou","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon tea in lobby is the best...","You can go to the top and through the funny tube with flashing lights and see the gold coloured everything... Then you could sit in. The sky view bar which looks quite a bit like a cruise ship and look out at the view, oh, there isnt really a view and it is often hazy anyway....
Or, you can sit on the 1st floor in the lovely oppulent furnishings and surroundings soaking up the atmosphere, looking upwards into the interior rooms and their balconies,... The time passes slowly, the food is very very nice and we found it much more enjoyable than. The production line of afternoon teas on the top floor...
I. Think it is also slightly cheaper on the 1st floor but that doesnt matter, you are happy to lay whatever they charge you ...

So, only my personal opinion but the 1st floor option is better all around...","4","2014-10"
"Beautiful dubai","This hotel and the staff are a 10 star not just a five
It is a must stay at hotel you will not find this kind of service above and beyond 
I wanted to live there I did not want to leave
I'm back home and missing burn al Arab so much it's so beautiful there","5","2015-06"
"Luxury with style","Burj Al Arab claims to be the only seven star hotel, mind you, they totally live up to it. We had stayed overnight during summers for my wife's birthday. They had pampered us to the highest level and made sure VIP service was provided all the time. A private butler was assigned to us and was available round the clock. The views from the room were breathtaking and the interiors were highly luxurious. Nice place to celebrate an important occassion","5",
"Expensive but nice","My parents, sister and I had high tea at the Burj Al Arab at the 4pm sitting. This was at the restaurant at the top of the building. You do need to make a reservation for high tea and anyone who looks younger than 21 needs to have ID to be let in. Our waiter was great. He was patient and professional but interacted with us and made it fun. The food was absolutely devine as were the drinks. I had a passionfruit iced tea - So. Good. So long as you advise staff, they can cater for any food allergies. Kitchen staff make all of the food fresh and are very efficient time wise. You also get a gift upon the conclusion of the tea. Spend a bit of time admiring the internal architecture of the building. There are a few exquisite dress and jewellery stores inside the Burj however they seemed a little bit too expensive for a tourist. ","5","2015-06"
"BEST HOTEL EVER","This hotel experience will stay with me for the rest of my life, hopefully I live long enough to take my children to Dubai for them to experience what I have during my stay at this 7 star resort. Thanks","5","2015-04"
"High tea at the Burj","To finish our amazing 6 week holiday in France we splurged on high tea at the Burj. The place is incredible. Like Dubai in general the Burj is over the top, opulent, other worldly. The high tea experience is ridiculously over priced but somehow with the service provided you don't mind. We loved it. The food is yummy but I think could do with modernisation. The view is lovely but hazy and only the super rich get the palm island side. We were ushered away from that side when I wanted to take a photo. Keeping up with the pace of change in Dubai is going to be the challenge for the Burj.","4","2015-06"
"A Specila Treat for my Friends from UK","I'm living and working in Dubai as an expat and my friends came over from UK. We booked into the Skyview Bar  as a treat for my friends birthday.
The place is amazing and the the overall ambiance makes you feel very pampered. The staff where very friendly and helpful and very accommodating. The food choice at first glance seems limited but the quality was excellent and of course the cocktails where first class.
All in all a very memorable and pleasant evening.","5","2015-06"
"My 7 stars Hotel","First of all, these Hotel so awesome due to the services very excellent. So when i've arrived and check in to lobby, the receptionist very hospitality and keep going smile as tourist, i look surprised when they treat me as 'guest Star'.

I like the rooms, very clean and modern (mix arabian style). Anykind of hotel facilities are deserve like 7 stars hotel.

The restaurant so incredible especially 'undersea restaurant'that i've order seat.

When you've plane go to Dubai, it's not complete if you don't stay here...

Thank's so muuchhh Al-Burj , you make our couple dreams come true.

#DBestHotelIndeWorldthatYouMustVisitBforeUDie","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon tea : Great Experience but a little pricey!","We had afternoon tea in the Sky lounge (you can email the restaurant directly). We were a little concerned over the dress code (no trainers etc), but it didn't seem to be that strictly enforced.

We went for the 1pm sitting and there were about 10 couples meaning we all got a window seat, but only the first 4 or 5 get the good view of the Jumeriah Beach hotel below you - otherwise you're just looking out to sea which isn't that interesting (we were lucky!).

Food was very nice - we didn't expect a carvery course for afternoon tea (roast beef and mashed potatoes!) but we enjoyed all 7 courses. I don't think anyone finished the final round of cakes and scones so be aware that whilst its small amounts it all adds up!

Great chance to see the inside of this iconic hotel. Some previous reviews suggested being there an hour early but they only allow you to queue up about 10 minutes before your slot, and there isn't really that much to see once you've marvelled at the amazing designs/colours, jumping water fountains, aquarium and gold leaf everywhere!

My wife was very impressed with the Hermes toiletries in the loos!

 A little bit pricey (what isn't in Dubai?)  - hence the 4*, but overall it was worth it!","4","2015-06"
"As Good As We Remembered!","This was our second stay at the Burj, having previously visited 8 years ago.  I gave it a glowing review back then when we were travelling with 2 children (then aged 2 and less than a year), so I was worried that it would not live up to our expectations a second time.

I need not have worried, we were there for 4 nights and every aspect of the hotel was excellent.  They welcome children with open arms and are beyond attentive in every area.  The butler service on each floor anticipated and catered to our every need.  One butler in particular stood out and I am so sorry I can't remember his name - ""thank you"" to the Indian gentleman with glasses on the 16th floor!

The decor has not changed and it is not to everyone's taste, but what sets this hotel apart from all others is the supremely friendly and efficient service.

On a personal level, the only thing I would have changed this time was to have booked a 2 bedroom suite instead of a single.  Every suite is on 2 levels, but the children's beds (they are now 8 and 10) were made up on the ground floor.  There really is plenty of room for this, but we had a 2 bedroom suite when we last visited (and didn't need it!) and for me it is preferable to have 2 bedrooms on the upper level.","5","2015-05"
"A Great Hotel to sail you to Dreamland!","One of the landmarks of Dubai this hotel is among the top hotels in the world for good reason, it hits all the requirements of a business or holiday traveller, save low prices which unfortunately are not on offer.

A great place to visit even if only for a drink!","5","2015-06"
"Out of this World","We stayed here for one night as a big birthday treat. I was looking forward to it immensely but deep down thought I may be disappointed when I get there....how wrong I was!!  It surpassed all expectations.  From the Rolls Royce that collected us to the suite which was luxurious.  We have stayed in several luxury hotels including a Jumeirah residence just next door but this experience was on a whole new level. If you can do it just once, it's an experience never to be forgotten.  The Reception area itself is a little underwhelming and small, but the rest of the hotel, especially the suites more than make up for it.  My husband and daughter used the private pool and beach area, where you get a complimentary cool box full of water and they even had complimentary ice creams delivered. You also get free access to Wild Wadi Waterpark.  ","5","2015-06"
"We popped in to take a photo and ended up having lunch","At the end of a city tour we popped into the Burj to have a look and take a photograph as we had heard so much about it. We decided to ask if we could have lunch and very quietly they said we could. Writing a review about a hotel like this is challenging because of its status but all I can say is that everything we had hoped for we got and the food and service were of the highest standards and I did not the the price was excessive for what we had. Hopefully one day we could return to visit.","5","2015-06"
"Amazing hotel ","My wife and I took advantage of the UAE residents discount to book ourselves in for a night of indulgence. An absolutely amazing place where you are totally spoiled by the attentive staff who were happy to ensure our stay was truly unique and special. Definitely one for a very special occasion as costs are consistent with the ultra luxury nature of the hotel ","5","2015-06"
"Lovely experience but premier prices","We had to go to see what all the fuss was about.  Just for cocktails at sunset. It certainly impressive from the drive through the security gates, into the lobby and then onto the SkyView Bar.

We had plenty of time to get photos.  Outside were three Rolls Royce cars so we had a few snaps near them, then we got shots if the Burj Al Arab exterior, into the lobby we got photos by the aquarium walls, water fountains and finally the entrance to the lifts.  All very grand!  
The bar was lovely and we got a window table.  We had to spend the 700 AED (about £130) for two of us.  We had 2 cocktails each and a Mezze food plate a little over 820 AED.  Cocktails were great, food ok.  Pricey yes, but a pleasant and memorable experience!","4","2015-06"
"Lovely food but felt a bit like a conveyor belt!","We went to Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea in the sky bar.  The hotel is exactly as you would picture it with gold everywhere and it is amazing to see it but I would view this more as tourist attraction than anything else.  

The food was lovely and the view from the sky bar is amazing but from the point you check in and have to stand around waiting in a small waiting area beside the lifts to the point when you are ushered to your seat you really know how things are going to go.  The staff are nice but they are not given the time to interact.   They are obviously on a tight time schedule to get through each stage of the tea and this really spoils the whole thing.  I noticed the lady at the table next to us (they were celelbrating 50 years of marriage) chatting to the waiter.  He did engage in coversation but as he did so he was edging towards the next table he had to serve and looked really conscious of the fact he had to keep moving.  Being sheparded in and all served in one sitting makes this feel you are part of a coach tour rather than an individual experience.

It was interesting to see the hotel and from that point of view we were glad we did it but it definitely didn't make us feel like we wanted to stay there.  We were staying at Raffles Dubai where the staff all took time to speak to us and make us feel at home so even if the prices were the same I would stay there every time.","3","2015-06"
"Delboysreviews","I booked a high tea here, as the only way you can get inside the hotel, is by booking high tea, lunch, or dinner. High tea is the cheapest option though. My tea was in the upper lobby part of the hotel, not the skybar, so make sure you confirm this when you book, especially if booked through a tour opperator. Having said all that, it was a good experience, the tea consists of 7 small courses, unlimited tea/coffee, and a small glass of bubbly to start off, only additional alcohol is extra, I woudn't like to guess the price, I can tell you that a latte coffee here would set you back 50 dir, about £9, but hey it's the Burj Al Arab, so what can I say, 7 star hotel = 7 star prices. What I can say is the serving of the 7 courses takes some time, this is deliberate of course, but I would say give yourself 3 hours here, otherwise you may find yourself jumping up and down between courses to grab some photo's. As for the Burj itself, I guess it's a hotel that divides opinion, some love it, some say it's to over the top, & blingy, but it's a brilliant piece of modern architecture none the less. Is it worth it, well as they say "" when in Rome,"" you only live once, so it's one of those things to cross of your bucket list.","4","2015-06"
"Felt like royalty","We traveled with two children ages 10 & 12 and I strongly recommend staying in the 2 bedroom suites.  The hotel butler/staff were extremely acommodating and the breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is located very close to the water park and ski Dubai which is a must if you have children.  It was very costly but well worth the experience.","5","2015-06"
"Afternoon tea at the Burj","We went to the Skyview Bar for afternoon tea, but the hotel offers other options, so check their website.  It's a wonderful treat for a special occasion - worth saving your pennies for. Service impeccable, food lovely, but there's lots of it (seven courses) so don't have lunch that day and go for a later sitting!","5","2015-06"
"Never let's you down","Our stay has been wonderful and it is always a pleasure to return to this place. We had fantastic dinner and just love the breakfast. We did have a little issue with our bathtub but housekeeping followed up quickly and sent my wife's favourite chocolates (which they had noted from our last stay). I am sure we will be back soon.","5","2014-10"
"Do you have strong curiosity to this hotel?","We stayed here one night because of only curiosity( why so known as a 7 star hotel).
Our room has so-called panorama view and we paid a little more than US$ 2,000. Room amities are wonderful- two perfumes( man and woman) , body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and body cream are luxurious not only in size but also in brand names. 
 But we did not know Dubai has sand dust air , that means panorama view( two sides) has no meaning. 
I think even clean air can gives only sea view ( sea view is 
the same in anywhere except blue lagoon area, don't you think so?)
Every room is two floors.
Luxurious ? Yes, I agree. 
Gold plated everywhere? Not really.

It has a aquarium sea food restaurant giving gourmet menu( we enjoyed). Dining restaurant is at top floor. Here we ordered a set menu( about $400 per person) , but 
to us, it may not good for oriental people, and all foods were salty. In fact we had a good time at ""Atmospere"" restaurant in Burj Kalipar , the tallest in the world, with half price next day while staying at The Palace Downtown in Dubai( about $500 per night). 

In conclusion: if you have a curiosity like me , try with 
no expectation your payment will be worthy enough.
But if not , find another hotel.","3","2015-06"
"A Night To Remember.","Wow, what an experience, service was top class drinks were expensive but who cares, it was a really great night out and would not have missed it.
If you go to Dubai you must go to the Burj as you will be amazed at the stunning opulence of the place definitely a 7 star hotel.","5","2015-06"
"Booked at Jumeira beach hotel and we were up graded to Burj Al Arab !","Total and absolute luxury. Picked up at  our chosen hotel and taken by white Rolls Royce along the causeway to the Burj.You need a pass to enter the causeway,past the guard (room key).Greeted at the Burj by several people, all wanting to assist and taken to our suite.We were told we would be treated like a king and queen. The underwater restaurant , travel by ""submarine""   and enter through a mirrored tunnel, all very exciting..Huge fish tank inside, floor to ceiling.We were treated like VIP's but we are not used to such attention and found it a bit too intrusive..Wadi Wadi  water park nearby, very pleasant.Our suite was on two floors, the essence of comfort, huge bathroom ,large jaccusi beautiful lounge area and dining room with all very mod.cons.Excellent food, they would provide anything you required.Really could not do enough for you.Office area with computer, phone.and many other amenities.Most certainly a one off experience.
Each landing of the hotel has its own butler who sits at a desk watching who gets into the lifts and who gets out , a bit disconcerting.Time came to leave and the butler at the desk asked us to sit down as we were leaving for the airport and give our opinions.Upon doing this he handed the apartment key to a guard who went in, presumably to see if we had stolen anything.and when he came out he nodded to the butler who then thanked us for our time.We were taken to the airport,again in a white Rolls Royce. whereupon several porters,who had seen the RR came running out to assist and loaded our baggage onto a trolley. Are you first class sir ? no, - business class sir ?  er no,- whereupon they all disappeared and left us to it. Most certainly an experience but one we would not care to repeat.","5","2014-07"
"sumptuous, see to believe","Marvelous architecture, amazingly located, sumptuous ....... 

Its a miracle standing in SEA, a magnificent architecture which can't be explained in words alone ""See to Believe"".

Entry is against booking of breakfast / Afternoon tea / any other Hotel facilities.

May be Slightly Expensive, but worth its experience. (I didn't considered food as criteria).

"The best hotel we have stayed in","We stayed in a one bed room panoramic suite, and had the best views of dubai from our room.
From the minute we drove up to this iconic building we knew this was going to be a amazing experience.
Staff are amazing and so many have made this a special trip for my wife and our 23 month old daughter.
Our daughter loved the two fountains in lobby and the fish tanks either side of the escalators.
We had drinks with friends in the sky view lounge as well as afternoon tea, it's a must. 
This hotel is perfect in every way and worth the money you spend here, we will be coming back next year for sure.","5","2015-06"
"Expensive but class","As I was on my honeymoon I decided to splash out and I had the afternoon brunch as it was a friday,there is no afternoon tea on a Friday. It cost €400 for the two of us in the sky view  restaurant, the food was excellent and views fantastic.As hotels go I have been in nicer hotels","4","2015-06"
"Well and Truly Spoiled","We are regular visitors to the hotel and each time our stay is better which is very hard to explain as having used Jumeriah Hotels we have a gold Sirius card with lots of perks. We had two special events whist there and beautiful cakes were delivered to our suite and one  was a strawberry tree with hand made chocolate trunk....wow is an understatement. From the great poolstaff where we had breakfast to the fab chefs who personally made sure we were looked afterinc chef Shammon,chef Adil and chef Hussein we truly thank you and your staff. The butlers are not overpowering at all just want to make sure all is ok. We are not millionaires by the way but feel like it whilst we are there....even for one night .....Thanks Niaml :)","5","2015-05"
"Not worth it.  Very good service and food but not spectacular.","The Burj is very costly.  My wife had lunch here with a group of friends and her bill was 720 AED.  I originally thought this was for the whole group but then learned it was her share - just for her meal.  I asked her what she had.  She said a salad and a piece of fish and one drink.  Nothing exotic and no dessert.  I asked her if it was exceptionally good food and she said it was good but she's had better.     In general, Food is expensive in Dubai but this is a new level of excess.","3","2015-01"
"Experience of a lifetime Amazing","Excellant all round worth every penny. Outstanding service, food, view, organised extremely fair. What can we say it was just amazing. We went to Dubai for my husband 60th birthday. They even brought out a small birthday cake. Alex our waiter was excellant. Something we will never forget.","5","2015-06"
"Such attention to detail was amazing!","We booked a one bedroom suite for a weekend away with  our two children.  The greeting on arrival was perfect, the staff were courteous, warm and friendly.  We were allowed to check in early and our suite was fabulous.  The fold down beds for the children were very comfortable and our bed was huge! The bathroom and jacuzzi bath were fantastic and the complimentary products smelled wonderful!  I couldn't possibly find any negative about any aspect of the hotel.","5","2015-05"
"Amazing you must have on bucket list","This hotel is insane! We got picked up at the hotel in a white Rolls Royce and that pretty much sums up the experience. You don't ask for things as they already know what you want. The size of the rooms are huge and basically a large apartment. The views are stunning which ever room or part of the hotel your in. I am so lucky to have stayed and fully recommend this to any one. You are made to feel like a king! ","5","2015-03"
"Unique hotel","I'm not sure what you were suppose to except from a 7 star hotel, Dubai has many amazing hotels.. The decoration is interesting im not sure what type of the theam they are going for... But even if you hate the colors and the interior design, staying at the Burj is an experience that one must try, from check-in to check -out they couldn't have done more to make it a 7* experience, we had the panoramaic suite the views were great, very clean and the most amazing Hermes range of products 
The personal butler was more than happy to help 
It's a great escape from the real world 
A must try if you are into luxury hotels","4","2015-06"
"Very underwhelmed!","Visited here for a very expensive evening meal.Upon arrival at the hotel, no one was about, expected to be greeted by concierges with a warm greeting, but then again we are only tourists. We entered the hotel, it was like a ghost town.Found a lady at a desk to the left , told us to take escalator to first floor, then lift to restaurant.After been given strict dress code on email was quite miffed to see group of  people leaving the restaurant in denim shorts and flip flops.Sat in empty room, no atmosphere.Food was very nice and service ok.Went up to the sky bar afterwards, again underwhelmed, especially the toilets.Not worth the £25 for a gin and tonic, seen better sky bars on cruise ships!As i say, very disappointed and not worth the excessive cost.","3","2015-05"
"Not so great","Stayed here for a week with my girlfriend and it wasn't good. The bed sheets had stains on and sweat marks  so they disn't change the bed sheets. Our neighbours non stop arguing and sounded like a port movie was going on. The food made my belly go like a tornado and the cleaners wouldn't give me any more toilet roll so I had to use towels. Finally one of the waiters got very aggressive towards me because I called him a baldy rd and told him he looked like Phil Mitchell","2","2015-05"
"the greatest hotel I've visited...","Hotel wonderful in terms of unique architecture and location on the island of the artificial. Equipment for the highest available level and the views breathtaking, Take a photographic cameras necessarily very good quality. My recommendation !!!","5","2014-09"
"Afternoon tea in the sky!","We enjoyed a beautiful afternoon tea in the sky! 

We arrived around 1530 and were able to soak up the ambience of the hotel (and take a few snaps of the amazing building)

Tip - do go up to the reception desk as they take note of the order you arrive and then get called to go up In that order. We were first so got the corner window seat with perfect views of the Palm and the Atlantis right round to the Burj! 

They were under the impression it was our anniversary so I was presented with a beautiful rose! 

The sandwiches, tarts, sorbet, patrisiere section were beautiful 

The glass of champagne followed by coffee was perfect and we didn't feel we needed a further glass of champagne! 

I Informed the waiter I was a vegetarian and everything was amended accordingly. My husband still was able to have meat so he was very happy 

The price tag is what it is but it is a beautiful and unforgettable experience 

Enjoy!","5","2015-06"
"GREAT","Burj Al arab is ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOTELS i have ever been to...the interiors and the decor is very beautiful...the water arrangments and the fountains are very beautiful...the breakfast is lovely and the hotel is worth visiting....","5","2014-07"
"Magnificent experience in Al Iwan Restaurant in Burj Al Arab","Again a wonderful experience, booked a table for 2 to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and all the nice surprises started.
Our table was decorated with Red rose petals in a heart shape, received a beautiful bouquet of roses and a delicious cake with Happy Anniversary to take home.  Food first quality as well as the service... It is my fourth time there and will definetelly be back next time I come to Dubai.   Also celebrated in Atmosphere in Burj Khalifa but the attentions in Burj Al Arab were more inspiring and better.   My thanks to the staff who really know how to make of your special day a memorable experience","5","2015-06"
"Vegas meets Dubai with all the shine and extravaganza!","My son came just for a few days to visit, and although we didn't stay there, too pricey for my personal pocket book, we went to an amazing and delicious Arabic brunch.  Once you step inside, you are transported to another world, a blend of ""Alice in Wonderland"", with a touch of ""Gaudi"", the Spanish architect known for his bright colors and twisted forms and shapes...Definitely ""decadent luxury"", marble everywhere, rich textured red drapes, lush sofas with cushions, fountains etc...A bit over the top for my personal taste, but I still wanted to experience it.  The food at Al Iwan on the ground floor was absolutely amazing, and from the greeting we got until the end of our meal, I have to say that the service was what one would expect in such a place.  The Outlet Manager, Rochdi  Moukatel, made sure with his staff that the guests were well attended.  The Chefs were attentive and explained in details the food.  It was a feast!  After our meal, we were able to go to the 27th floor (Thanks to Mr. Moukatel), to have a look at the lounge-bar and have a coffee and there we met the most knowledgeable and charming bar tender or rather mixologist from Kenya, Steve.  We had a great time talking to him.  Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable brunch, but...it felt like we were walking in a ""vault""....because when we wanted to have a peak on the 27th floor, we got a negative answer, although, we were spending some money for brunch already and our two expressos were certainly not ""given"" either...","4","2015-05"
"Awesomeness undefined","No better feeling than to be there , loved the service , the food and the place itself  . No better place to celebrate one's wedding anniversary than Burj Al Arab . The experience is going to last a lifetime for sure .","5","2015-01"
"Must see","I was not able to get into the hotel  but I can tell you it is a landmark - a beautiful imaginative structure that is simply breathtaking.  We did not have time to do high tea but we were able to get fairly close from the beach beside the hotel.  Am amazing tribute to a country so young.  Its beautiful and awe inspiring in the pictures - I can't put into words what it is like to actually be there.","5","2015-04"
"Impressive. Excellence in every sense!","I was a bit skeptical about people´s reviews of Burj Al Arab thinking they were perhaps a little over the top, but I was completely mistaken. BAA is everything you would imagine and more.

From the moment you enter the hotel, the display of opulance and wealth is conspicuous. Service is superb. So, even if you are just a visiting guest, like we were, you get royal treatment. 

Security to access the premises is high. Take note that if you are not a guest, or don´t have reservations for a lobby tour or any of the bar or restaurants within, you are not even allowed to pass the security point that gives you access to the private bridge that connects to the hotel´s island. 

As we pulled up at the entrance, we noticed only Rolls Roys, MB limo´s and Bentley´s in the parking. Huge bell boys,and very tall hostesses courteously greeting customers as they entered the premises, all impecably and beautifuly dressed. I am pretty sure a woman cannot get a job in that hotel unless her height is at least 5´8. 

Hotel lobby is colorful and rich. It has the air of lavishness and grandeur that everyone expects. It seemed to me that decore is not just arabic, but a melting pot of palatial extravagant styles. From the lobby you can admire its tall atrium, huge golden columns, a large dancing fountain in the center, and two electric stairs that lead to the upper floor with beautiful acuariums on both sides. Only high end stores on site: Cartier, Chopard. and the like.

Burj Al Arab is one of the best hotels in the world, and the most iconic landmark in Dubai. Yes, to stay or dine there is expensive, but it is worth every penny! If you want to experience excellence and lavishness, you should visit BAA at least once in your life if you have the chance.","5","2015-04"
"7 star really meets standards","Too good, seriously, if you want a place that will exceed your expectations on another level, choose this place - we stayed one night and it was like staying as royalty - every inch of the hotel was glamorous, from the music in every room to the mirrors and plasmas, these rooms all have two floor duplex style suites, large staircase, walk in dressing area, grand marble bathroom with jacuzzi, high end products (we had Hermes products everywhere), many butlers in and out of the room, a true paradise for someone who wants an extra special stay","5","2014-07"
"a lifetime experiance","I stayed here on business and had a suite I don't think I could ever beat this place the whole experience is really something you can put into words a real must if you can afford it.","5",
"explosive luxury","The luxury, suites and personalized attention by the staff makes a visit to this hotel worthwhile. the restaurants, though not cheap, are excellent, both in the quality of their food and service. The architecture is stunning.","5","2015-05"
"Wonderful Service - Great Stay!","The Burj Al Arab was on my hotel bucket list for a long time - just wanted to experience it for myself.  I travel a lot for business and pleasure, and beyond any dazzling luxury, amazing views, exquisite spa treatments, and delicious meals, attentive and thoughtful customer service is really what makes a good stay a great stay. The Burj Al Arab provided all of the above.  As one example, while checking in, I happened to mention to a staffer that I wear the Hermes fragrance that they stocked in the suites, and that I was mildly disappointed - not griping or complaining at all - to learn they recently switched to another Hermes fragrance.  On my second day, I'm getting off of the lobby escalator when a staffer I never met hands me a bag. Inside - the fragrance I wear!  She said that she heard that I wore it and she searched the hotel and found a bottle for me! The thoughtfulness and attentiveness of that gesture really made my stay unforgettable - it is really the thought that counts. Kudos to the Burj Al Arab staff and team for a job very well done!","5","2015-05"
"7 star! Butlers need more training","What an incredible hotel experience. This hotel is about 12 years old but still the preeminent hotel in Dubai and remains world renowned. Access to hotel is very limited to guests only through a private bridge with security like US embassy. We had a panoramic two storey room which was shockingly beautiful and over the top. The butler service was mediocre at best and of very limited use. I had to asked if they unpack for guests after them not offering it. Too late, did it already. The foreign butler staff need more ""british"" polish which is strange for a hotel of this caliber you would expect the service to match...it doesn't. Aside from useless butler service, the rest of the staff are attentive, pleasant and plentiful...they are everywhere. 

You pay through the nose for absolutely anything including $15 coffee $40 chocolate cake slice and $100 steaks. Breakfast if not included is $75/person. 

Incredible hotel, location, staff, beach, privacy.","4","2015-05"
"Sky View Bar","Absolutely amazing evening and what a way to start my birthday celebrations. The staff were amazing beyond any expectations. Thank you for making our visit extra special in every way possible. We will definitely be back very soon. Taxi home ice-ing on the cake","5","2015-05"
"Wow just amaIng","My wife and I visited the sky view bar for the high tea to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary , everything from start to finish was amazing. It does not seem to matter if your worth millions or just every day hard working people you are all treated in the same special way. 

The food we were served was simply fantastic, and lots of it.

The views were also amazing.

I can't fault this place at all. Well worth a visit to make anyone feel special.","5","2015-05"
"Unique dining experience at Al Mahara","Celebrated a friend's birthday at the Al Mahara restaurant.  Outstanding customer experience from the moment one calls to book a table.  Once there and after security check, one is treated with outstanding respect and professionalism. The gold plated lift is quite an experience and the place itself unique.   The sea bass for two and the signature salad are a must-one has to try those. My friend had a complimentary birthday cake. The staff are professionals, friendly and very welcoming.  Were given flowers and were driven back to Jumeirah Beach Hotel in a Rolls Royce.  it has been a life time experience.","5","2015-05"
"It was fantastic ","Although it was very expensive hotel to stay a week in there but when u go inside the hotel u will forgot how much money u hv given to stay there every body in the world should visit burj al arab emirates if u go thorough helicopter u will be welcomed first class at last i would like to say that u would go there","5","2015-05"
"Outstanding hotel","This place is a dream - the hotel the surroundings. The restaurants the sea it's all too much - breath taking views & well... Life changing :-) recommended to all -the Aquarium restaurant is stunning I have no idea how they managed to make it so beautiful can't wait to return truly magical x","5","2014-10"

"Wow","Our stay at the Burj was amazing. From the moment you reach security you are treated with outstanding service. Yes, it is expensive but if you are undecided on whether to go or not like we were... Definitely do it.","5","2015-05"
"Lunch is nice, service is good","We been there for lunch.
But not big lobby as expect.
Everything is nice.
The lady at sky bar also nice.
Not cheap the lunch, but worth.
Must order bottle white wine, AED 680 is very nice, no need order expensive one.
After lunch, we required a golf car to driver us to Souk.
The lady who's standing in front gate is great helpful.

"Feel like a King!!","Great place to stay at least once in your life. My wife and I had decided to stay here for one night even though it's a bit on the high side for us; USD2,000.00 per night. The room was HUGE. The ground floor was so spacious you can actually play hide and seek in there. The view on the window is breath taking. There was a bar with living area including dining. Laptop included for usage. A chilled bottle of champagne made it perfect. That was just the ground floor. The staircase leading to the upper floor looks like something from the movies; grand with beautiful chandeliers. The toilet was also HUGE. Jacuzzi with shower. The whole complete package. Complimentary branded toiletries was included; Hermes. The master bedroom was just like from a fairy tale. Best of all, there was a personal butler on call 24hours.","5","2014-06"
"Arabian Dream","Dubai is astonishing, and without a doubt this hotel is one of the most luxurious hotel I´ve been, the people does their best to make your stay a lifetime experience. The beach is really nice, the food although expensive is worth a shot.","5","2015-05"
"When only the best will do","On my first visit to Dubai 15 years ago, I tried the newly opened Jumeirah Beach hotel admiring every day the imposing view of the Burj Al Arab dead opposite.
Recently I had the opportunity to checkout  this incredible piece of architecture and enjoyed a long weekend with my wife.
Having passed security before the bridge to the man made island, check in was swift in our panoramic suite on the 13th floor by a very charming young lady who explained in great detail all the facilities of this vaste suite, measuring a cool 170m2 over to floors.
All accommodations are in duplex configuration, so being on the 13th floor means 150 Meter above sea level, garanteeing an outstanding view over the city.
We had the highest expectations when we booked this hotel, and were not disappointed.
It is sheer opulance throughout, maybe sometimes the decor is over the top for non Arabic customers, but then the various water fountains in the atrium or some friendly ""Hello"" from one of the staff distracts you from all that golden and rich furnishing.
One of the main attraction is the restaurant and bar on the top of the building at over 300 Meters high together with the specially built landing platform for helicopter arrivals.
Being on an island, a buggy service is provided to ferry people back and forth to the 
beach or to the many restaurants one can dine that make part of the Jumeirah group.","5",
"A wonderful lunch and beautiful experience","Of course we would go back!!!
We booked lunch with our tour guides Desert Adventures at the end of a Magical  Dubai trip ( highly recommended - for a whistle stop tour of Dubai- if you have never been before or if you are not familiar with Dubai it's a really great intro to the city ) 

We had lunch at the first floor Arabic restaurant - a buffet Arabic lunch. Everything about it was lovely

The staff were genuinely interested -or seemed to be in all their guests. They served my daughter apple juice with real gold flakes - and said she should have it because that's what Princesses drink.

They served house wine by the glass with all the deference accorded to fine wine.

We had a wonderful window table with sea view. Everything was of course really luxurious. 

Food was beautiful and presentation amazing 

It was a lovely and unforgettable lunch at Burj Al Arab

Thank you","5","2015-03"
"High Tea Sky View","If you're going to do High Tea then do it at the Burj. Some might say it is overpriced but you are paying for the experience and judging by how full the restaurant was, then a lot of people agree with me. The food was great although I don't know why they start with a simple berry tart first and then go to savoury. Still we enjoyed it immensley and struggled to eat it all. Our little waiter Hussein was a cutie and very attentive to our needs. Would highly recommend it!","5","2015-05"
"Perfect hotel!!","The hotel service has no mistake everything was perfect. Loved the unlimited wild wadi access, the beach with complimentary coolbox full of goodies and the stingrays we got to see around the hotel. Pool upstairs is amazing!! If you celebrate anything dont forget to mention as they gave us a free room upgrade and a rose bouquet/cake for our anniversary!","5","2015-05"
"Birthday Brunch","I visited my Son in Dubai for his 25th Birthday and took him to the Burj Al Arab restaurant Al Muntahna on the 27th Floor.
It was not cheap, but, it was better than first class!
Dress smartly.
The food - buffet, is incredible and every type you could want.
Amazing service and the views are incredible.
We arrived at 11am and left at 4pm!
Save up and go!","5","2015-05"
"Do not waste your money -High Tea","Booked high tea at the Burj Al Arab for my daughters birthday cost for 2 of us £240 .The tea was in a cornered off area on the first floor lobby in the ""Sahn Eddar"".Alcohol consumption is for 21years and above. My daughter is older but looks younger as she had no ID was not allowed to drink anything but soft drinks. The sandwiches were average and dry at the edges.The scones were ok but the cakes !!!!! a rice crispy base with a blob of jam on it. white chocolate filled with yoghurt,a thin wafer with a piece of fruit on it. all very disappointing. If you have money to waste go but otherwise go to somewhere who knows and specializes in afternoon tea. If you do go 2 hours is sufficient ..You are greeted with a glass of sparkling wine/grape juice. The sandwiches  arrive  then the cocktail, scones,tea/coffee with cakes.
Also always been told to judge a place by the toilets these were adefinate no no , cracked grout loose and with gaps very aged scruffy and smelt.
This is the first bad report I have done but please think before you spend","2","2015-05"
"Westerners beware","Having been to 5 star hotels in Dubai for many years, this is the worst, if you book with half board included. You are sent to the tackiest self service restaurant, that most motels would cringe at, including a banjo playing pub singer that even Louis Walsh would despise! So we complain about the poor choice, service and quality and are told that as a complementary gesture, we can go to either the Asian or Arabic buffet restaurants, which were much better but no choice of western food. In fact they have no option for Western food under half board except for the pool side cafe (like on the Apprentice!).. To the general manager, how can you claim to be 7 stars, yet offer no table service for your guests?! I would also comment that most of the food is not freshly made, in most hotels in Dubai they pride themselves on making food inhouse and providing the freshest food they can, again that doesn't work in buffet restaurants! 
Great building and suite, butlers are very helpful and friendly.","1","2015-05"
"Romance up in the Air","My partner completely surprised me with a booking for afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab. This iconic hotel had only been admired from afar. Yesterday  we crossed the bridge and entered into the most magical Kingdom of splendour and charm. 
The reception was the 1st wow! The cascading water fountains  greeted you as the aquarium  amazed you as you escalated up to the 1st floor. 
Then you look up. My goodness, what a structure! What design! What colour! Golds and Blues.... Gold and Red.... stunning. More fountains cleverly tapping in rythmn, like a troop from Riverdance. 
Sadly my view was sadly distracted by many jewellery  shops, which I feel did spoil the theme and slender of the moment. 
We then arrived at the lift that transported us up to the Sky in a glass elevator, as magical as Willy Wonkers.  
On arriving at our destination  we were greeted by a member of staff who showed us to our table which overlooked the coastline heading towards Burg Khalifa. The best seats in the restaurant by far. The sun behind us.... the view of the marinas, the hotels below and the stunning beaches and turquoise sea. 
The staff introduced themselves and the service began. A tidal wave of culinary delights tickled our taste buds and one fabulous course after another arrived. No rushing, just relaxed in our big comfortable  arm chairs taking photos, at every opportunity, to savour the opulent moments.
Sylvia  then appeared. She was in charge of service. We couldn't eat another thing and she saw us struggling with the burj tower of dainty  pastries, on the table in front of us having devoured all previous courses including fillet beef. She arranged for our cakes to be preserved.... as she had a big surprise awaiting, which she and my partner had previously discussed (I now learn).  Before my eyes appeared a large glass dome filled with a mysterious  swirl of, what looked like smoke. As the dome was removed the liquid ice vapours gradually dispersed  to reveal a bed of red rose petals and in the middle a box with the most beautiful sparkling diamond ring.... 
My breath was taken away and my wonderful partner then proposed to me. With tears of absolute happiness  and still utter shock, I accepted. The Burj Al Arab team pulled off the most romantic moment any lady could have wished for and Sylvia and her hard working team made every second special. 
It didn't end there. We were gifted with tokens of our visit and flowers. Of course our cakes we're boxed too. 
We later travel back down to the 1st floor and relaxed in the comfort of another comfortable  sofa listening to the strings of a harp being plucked in the distant bar.
We watched the Sun go down, in the perfect place, again thanks to Sylvia's helpful intervention. 
When we were ready and we decided to leave, my finance and I  took a buggy ride from the Burj Al Arab, along  the beach, for a romantic boat ride. 
A day neither of us will ever forget for so many magical moments that only happen to most in dreams. Thank you - 7 star indeed!!

"Not a 7 star experience","I booked this hotel for our marriage anniversary and was very excited about the experience.  I requested special arrangements as a surprise for this occasion, and I was promised one, when I asked what would be arranged, I was told that they will take care of it and not to worry about it.  

We arrived late just before midnight, it took a long time to pass the first security check by the gate, however we were later greeted by a lovely lady who took us to the suit, where the butler started showing us around, although the suit was impressive in decor, I have to say that the suit did not smell fresh, while going around, I was anticipating the surprise, however, there were none, finally the butler casually says "" I know you are celebrating your anniversary, I can arrange for some cake or something, or do you think its too late in the day"".  This ruined the surprise factor.  Next day on the check out I enquired about the surprise, five minutes later a man comes with a paper bag with what seemed to be missing amenities from the bathroom (they forgot to put), and another bag with cake, and bouquet of 4 or 5 roses.  This was handed to me to carry.

I then requested to file a complaint, and asked for the bags to be carried to the car ( you would think at a seven start hotel that would not be something you would need to point out).  

I got an email a week later enquiring about the problem then a phone call.
They offered to make it up for me by inviting us to lunch of dinner at one of their restaurants which Ive been to previously.  I told them, I just spent almost 4000 dollars for not even a full day and that is how they think they will compensate a ruined special occasion.

It just confirms that the management is bad and careless.

Will never recommend it to anybody.","3","2015-02"
"Bigsome and an Elegantly Cool Hotel","The bridge connecting the Road and the hotel is a connectivity over water which makes a person feel the richness of the hotel at the instance of entering the bridge itself.

The design is just mesmerizing. Half above water and the rest beneath the water. A Lovely boat, a real Big Boat. :))

The entrance is equipped with a lovely water fall playing with water and Fire, making it a really cool entrance.

Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig Lobby having Huge Aquariums on both the sides adjacent to the elevators which carry you up and down.

The hotel has a lovely restaurant which oversees the complete city. The entrance provides a view of the famous Jumeirah Beach and hotel Jumeirah which adds to its mesmerizing Beauty.

Great Food, one who actually understands the class of International Cuizine.","5",
"High Tea ","We celebrated our 23rd wedding anniversary with high tea at Burj al Arab - absolute gorgeous experience! 
The decor made me feel I was in ""the Hunger Games"", futuristic, colourful & amazing. The view was fantastic. Food was gorgeous, there was no alcohol as it was Ramaden but the tea menu was great & I loved trying some new teas.
The service & attention really made our day extra special. 
Yes it was quite expensive but definitly a must do once, worthwhile 
experience.","5","2014-07"

"HORRIBLE AND GARBAGE FOOD SERVED BY THIS 7 STAR HOTEL !!!","We had a tour group of 25 people having the buffet dinner in the Burj Al Arab restaurant in Dubai in early of this May. The price was US$185 per person. This 7 star hotel restaurant provided us with garbage food. There was a pan of potato, a pan of pain macaroni with some tomato sauce, a pan of over-cooked vegetable. The baby lamb was not chewable. The shrimps and crabs were not fresh and with many unclean stuffs like fishing filum. Our appetite were spoiled by these food. The manager of the restaurant denied the food was bad and said they never got complaint. I had taken photos of the foods as attached below for your comment.","3","2015-05"
"When one of my dream came true...","As soon as you step inside the Burj, you are greet by three team members with some local specialities and a refreshing towel.

The early check-in was done smoothly in our Suite with an Ipad and a glass of mint lemonade. Then one butler introduced his self and showed us the Suite...
How can I say ?! It seems that no one has ever stayed here, everything is so clean and well maintained... About the decor, I totally love it (specially that the gold/yellow is my favorite color!), every single cushion has been cared, carpet seems brushed, shining window and faucets...
I understand that the management wants to keep the Suite as they were designed at the opening, however, they should update the room without changing the soul (tv in the bathroom by example).

During turndown service, we received some samples of perfume, that is a nice touch! I have to say also that the bed linen is one of the best I have ever slept in.

Regarding the amenities, this point was disappointing: slippers of poor quality, disposable shoe shine (no shoe mitt), no shopping bag in the room... I would also advise to change the design of packaging, it might be smarter to use the white & gold instead the orange...Just my opinion.

Regarding the service, the spa was really nice, not so dazzling that the one at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray, however the staff was amazing; offering some water in the steam room, refreshing the towels... The view from the swimming pool and steam room is stunning. The waiters at the private beach were fabulous : setting up our sunbeds with a icehouse containing towels and water, offering us some snack goods, ice cream and sweets. 

Regarding the restaurants, the atmosphere at Al Mahara is Unique however the food was disappointing (especially the foie gras and the dessert). 
Also, we had our breakfast at Bab Al Yam, the venue is far to look like a 7* restaurant, rather as a ""canteen De Luxe"". The food was fresh however I expected Champagne, Cappucino with hotel logo...some details that are essentials in this kind of landmark.

Few points to improve :
-We had a wine bottle holder with two glasses but seems that the bottle has been forgotten.
-Upon our arrival, the luminous clock was not working, the butler told us that someone will come...it has never been fixed! Also, I have noticed 2 spotlights fused in the bathroom on arrival.

My final rating is 6*, unfortunately, even if the experience was amazing, few details were missing to deserve 7*...

Nothing more to say, this must be experienced once in a lifetime...

Hope to be back soon for an other unique stay!","5","2015-03"
"Amazing treat- the highlight of our holiday!","We booked online to have cocktails at The Skyview Bar. Everything was perfect - from the personal greeting at the car door, to the lobby hostess, to the lift boy, to the reception staff at the lifts exit, to the wonderful bar and waiting staff in the bar itself. We spent around 20 minutes of awe in the incredible lobby and atrium, before taking the scenic exterior lift up to the 27th floor. Upon arrival there, nothing was too much trouble, everything was explained in detail and advice given as to cocktail choices, based on our personal preferences. We had a view of the ocean towards The Palm which was lovely as dusk fell. Then, without us asking, we were offered a table that had become vacant on the other side of the room, which had truly spectacular views over the illuminated city. We enjoyed some mezze with our drinks, again after thoughtful consultation with our server. The presentation of both the food and drink was out of this world. Truly an experience that will remain with us forever. A wonderful experience, not to be missed!","5","2015-05"
"Superb for evening cocktails","My wife and I visited the Burj Al Arab for evening cocktails as we wanted to visit but did not want the expense of staying here.  We originally wanted to visit for afternoon tea but this was booked up weeks in advance (tip - get your hotel concierge to book ahead for you well ahead and make sure you have a reservation as you will not get past the gatehouse on the drive without one and even our taxi driver wanted to see our reservation before agreeing to take us from our hotel).

After our reservation was checked at the gatehouse we were greeted as we left our taxi at the hotel foyer, were politely directed to the ""check-in"" for the Sky Bar (they already knew who we were and why we were there) and then escorted in the elevator (with superb views on the way up) to the reception area of the Bar.

We were originally seated with a view of the Palm, though as it was evening the view was limited to the developments on the Palm and the darkness of the sea.  After about half an hour we were moved (with no prompting from us) to a table with a city view as one became available.

The Bar is divided into two with one side hosting a restaurant and the other hosting the cocktail bar.  The free canapes were decent, the live music was good and the minimum spend on the bar bill was not excessive.

I can recommend the Mojito's and they serve (and I sampled a few to make sure they had travelled well) Fuller's Honeydew organic ale.  They also serve high end bar meals (sliders and the like) though I did not need to eat anything as the supply of canapes was repetitive.

All in all a very worthwhile experience","5","2015-03"

"Afternoon Tea","We couldn't travel to Dubai and not visit this hotel ! We booked a table for a eight course afternoon tea. The food, scones, finger sandwiches and cakes were amazing and just being surrounded by great opulence just added to this experience. A truly wonderful afternoon.","5","2015-04"
"True Seven Stars","Had not been for six years while trying Atlantis & Ritz Carlton etc with the kids. Returning reminded me quickly how special this place is, everything is beyond expectation, service levels are as high as ever and the hotel is simply stunning after 15 years of being the best in the world. Where can you go where even the doormen know your name, its total perfection. Some would say its over the top but clearly they have not stayed in the place. The kids loved it all, especially the sweety trolley that arrived at your suite every evening! Poolside is as good as ever and we really liked the afternoon boxes of popcorn, a never been seen before add on. The staff are great and are always making an effort to indulge you before you have asked them for anything. Its back on my annual trip must do from now on and cant wait to get back there even though i have only been home a day! The beds are the most comfy that money can buy. This time we did the helicopter trip from the rooftop helipad, truly spectacular! The burj is so far ahead of the other top class hotels that it truly does deserve the seven star status! Love it!","5","2015-05"
"Tea Time Sky Bar","a greatful experience during our first trip to Dubai.
it´s expensive, but unforgettable.

i think it is one of the things that you should have seen in dubai

excellent service, very good food and beverages, a greatful atmosphere

only the price is very expensive....","4","2015-04"
"An Expensive Lunch but a very Memorable Ocassion","We decided to visit this 7 star hotel and have lunch. Firstly if you want to get in men must be wearing trousers and women smartly dressed. The hotel is gated. They have a minimum spend in the restaurant for lunch of about £60.00 and it is very easy to spend over this. It is obviously not cheap but it was very luxurious and we loved having the opportunity to go inside look around and take photos and soak up the atmosphere. 

We went for our Silver Wedding Anniversary and they asked us when we sat down if it was a special occasion and they gave us a rose and a small cake as a gift. There was a harpist playing through the meal which was lovely. Nothing was too much trouble and the food and service was exceptional. I would thoroughly recommend for a special occasion to go there but be prepared to spend about £100 per head","5","2015-04"
"just the best","By far this is the best hotel in the world, not only because of the beauty of its building and facilities but because of the service,
Your butler makes sure that you have everything you need and more.  Room service is amazing everything is of outstanding quality.  The adjacent prperties are worth a visit as well and the gym is great too.","5","2015-05"
"1001 Nights come true!","If I could only use one word it would be WOW.
This is the landmark of Dubai so being privileged enough to be invited to stay in this amazing property is a dream come true.
Service is top-notch and if there were a 6th star then this would qualify as a 6th star hotel.
Room was huge, on two levels and amenities were full size Hermes products. Yes, you read me right. And upon leaving the level butler makes sure you don't forget your Hermes products.
The food is of excellent quality. Please, don't go for the international section at breakfast but eat the Emirati menu. You need to try camel milk cheese and desserts while there!
The beach is very well maintained (though swimming is treacherous, hence the very present life guards outside and in the water).
For an even better view, you can go to the top floor bar/restaurant for a drink at night (make sure you make a reservation if you want a table next to the window).

The SPA is excellent and offers out-of-the-ordinary treatments (not your usual scrub and mask!). Make sure you take a plunge on the 18th floor pool that overlooks Dubai!

I need to come back!","5","2015-04"
"A fantastic day out at the Burj Al Arab, Jumeirah, Dubai","What a beautiful hotel - magnificent gold walls and doors and decor - outstanding!
We took High Tea booked at 4pm, ushered into a glass elevator, up 25 floors to the Sky View bar and were seated within seconds looking out at the panoramic view of the sea and the coast line of Dubai. We were waited on like royalty, our every request was administered to. We had a 7 course High Tea and as i had mentioned we were in Dubai celebrating my 50th, i was brought a red rose and birthday cake. It was supposed to be a one off visit but i shall have to re visit. I cannot fault this place at all.","5","2015-05"
"Afternoon tea in the Sky View Bar","WOW - I thought it was worth every penny of the £115 each for champagne afternoon tea - it's the whole experience from the moment you walk through the front door.  The staff are without fault, the food was amazing and the view is breath taking. You only need to do this once in a lifetime - it's the real deal. You get a small momento to take away.     Please go hungry because there is plenty of food.  I love Claridges in London but this is something extra.","5","2015-04"
"I am now spoiled","This hotel is the benchmark. You never want to leave. I had a series of high profile guests at this hotel and It was by far the best hospitality I have ever encountered. The Staff were so well trained. The butlers were exact and added to the entire experience. Bravo for showing the world how to do it.","5","2014-12"
"Is the Burj Al Arab worth the self acclaimed 7 stars?","Booking the room on the Jumeirah web site was not possible so I had to call. The person on the other end got my email address wrong even though I spelt it twice. I had to call again to find out why I didn't get any confirmation which is when I found out the information they wrote down was wrong. All my details were also on my Sirius account which they also had the info for.
Check in was smooth and the staff knew our names before we arrived at the door of the hotel. The tv screen in the room did display the name of the previous guest though.
When asked which daily paper we would like we picked The National which is printed in Abu Dhabi. This paper is available everywhere in Dubai at 6am when travelling to work. However the Burj Al Arab couldn't deliver the paper to the room before 11am. The second day was closer to midday! Service? Hmmm This paper is normally available in most Dubai hotel lobby's in the paper rack. In short, don't expect to be able to read a local paper with your breakfast.
The panoramic one bedroom suite was superb and I particularly liked the espresso machine but the coffee pods were not labelled so it was a little bit of guess work ;)
The sky bar was a great place and the staff behind the bar were really friendly and helpful. We spent both nights in there. The bar staff of Stephen, Guru, Michael, Richard and Marko deserve a special mention for their hospitality and expertise! 
We asked the bar staff to have a bottle of wine sent to our room and this was organised. Arriving on our floor we asked the butler if the wine had arrived and he called the bar to arrange this. The wrong wine arrived so it then took another 25 minutes to get the right bottle.
We also asked the butler if we could see a menu for the seafood restaurant which never appeared. 
Checkout was an easy process which was conducted with the butler on the floor. This was an easy and pleasant way of checking out avoiding all the hotel day trippers in the lobby. We had left the bags in the room for the staff to take to the car which was in valet parking and one of the butlers called downstairs to give the valet parking ticket number. When we left the car was delivered to the front door and luckily I had a bag to place in the boot of the car. I am glad I did as I noticed we didn't have our luggage in the car so we asked it. Another 5 minutes go by waiting for the luggage to be delivered and the car being driven around outside to make way for all the day trippers arriving and leaving from the hotel. Incidentally, this is when the daily news appear was delivered to us!

The hotel is a beautiful building with amazing rooms, restaurants and views. The staff in all most areas of the hotel are warm and welcoming. The break down comes from one group of staff having to organise something with another group of staff. The attention to detail seems to be missing or falls through the cracks very easily. I have had better service in your average 5 star hotels which are a lot cheaper than the Burj Al Arab as they have seemed to be able to handle details in a much better way than at the Burj.","4","2015-05"
"Wow","I have to say, what an amazing hotel, so many staff taking care of us and a real 7 star hotel service, it was just outstanding and great.

My family and I are in love with this place, a must try once in a life time.
","5","2015-05"
"""Not really my cup of tea""","My wife and I visited the Sky Lounge for drinks and I must say the staff where very helpful and accommodating. It was all just a bit ostentatious for my taste. The interor of the hotel made me feel like I was trapped inside Julian Clarys laundry basket. The Inside the Sky Louge bar reminded me of a jazzed up Mecca Bingo but it had a ""restaurant at the end of the universe"" feel to it which I quite enjoyed. Drinks where very over priced and at night the veiws where not that impressive. I think it must be much more spectacular during the day time. A bit of a novelty really.","3","2015-05"
"Could not enter    I tell you why","If you want to go inside.......you have to book a room or dinner, high tea....lit cost a fortune.....so I just stopped at the gate an looked at the building.
It is a ripoff on most of these famous buildings in Dubai","2","2015-04"
"Amazing decor ","I spent one night here on September 2014 and i should say that the rooms are really worth it. A 2 floors suite with an amazing bathroom and JACUZZI! !! The living room is huge and as well as the bedroom !!Basically , you don't need to go out from your room , it's just wonderful living in there !! Room service , a quick walk upstair to the Sky Bar for a quick drink and that's all. Enjoy a romantic gateway and lock the door. However , a little overpriced .....

"Love love love the Burj Al Arab!!!","We decided to stay 2 nights at the Burj Al Arab to celebrate my significant age birthday.
What a fabulous & memorable time we have had!
The staff a very friendly, professional & very very helpful. 
Check in is in your suite & it is very prompt. You get introduced to your butler & he takes you through all the features of your high tech suite. The butlers we had Syed & Ahmed we absolutely fantastic & an asset to the hotel.
The suite is absolutely beautiful, very spacious & very well appointed. The hotel is 15 years old but our suite looked brand new- very clean & very well maintained.
There is the beautiful full sized Hermes toiletries, the special gift at turn down service every night that is left on your pillow, the chocolates, Arabic sweets,fruit baskets, juices, unlimited water, snacks pre dinner & the unlimited Nespresso that lovely touches to your hotel experience.
We tried the in room dining one night & it was excellent. The butler delivered a beautiful cake & bunch of red roses post dinner to wish me a happy birthday - what a beautiful gesture. 
The butler also organised for us to view the royal suite- which is just draw dropping beautiful- which I thought was a lovely gesture & a real treat! I felt that the nutlets went above & beyond the call of duty in making our stay very memorable- nothing was too much trouble.
The wifi in the hotel is excellent!
We booked a table at  Al Mahara - wow- another breathtaking experience- ambience was stellar- service was outstanding & food was excellent. They had a beautiful birthday cake for me along with chocolates & a dozen roses- I felt so special!
A beautiful hotel, with beautiful decor & outstanding customer service- yes it is expensive but it's an experience you will never forget- and isn't life all about experiences!!
I love love love the Burj Al Arab!!

"Must Try","As expected, this was a luxurious, even decadent, experience. 
My wife & I stayed overnight with our fellow directors courtesy of our company. We checked in at 2pm and were busy trying to get everything out of our room and the hotel before our gala dinner. From the welcome, check-in on the floor, our butler's introduction to the various amenities and features of the room to room service and check-out - all was very professional and to a standard you would expect from this category hotel. The executive pool & beach (reached by buggy) was also a highlight. And the pillow menu.

The only slight let-downs were a paid for, averagely stocked mini-bar (I would expect better and different at this level) and a very nice but not exceptional breakfast buffet.

Now that we have tried it, we don't need to go back - but we would like to.","5","2015-04"
"wow","I can't even explain. My family and our family friends had afternoon tea at the lobby lounge last week. Every course was amazing and everyone in the party thought it was great. First we started out with the berry tarts. The berries were SO GOOD! Next came the sandwiches, great and simple. Then came the beef with aj jus, tasty and cooked greatly. Then came the scones, the best scones I have ever had. Then we had the sorbet, amazing. Lastly, they came out with pastries, the best! At the end of us eating they gave out chocolates and a golden pen a really nice touch. The bathrooms are stocked with hermes products so that is a plus!

After our amazing afternoon tea, we went to the lobby and got a buggy. The buggy drove us to there private beach and we changed into our t shirts and our swim suits. My kids and I had a lot of fun at the beach and the lifeguards there were really nice and fun to talk to. After an hour of playing we got the buggy and then they got a uber to take us back to our hotel.

Is this hotel worth the 560 price tag for afternoon tea? YES IT IS! It was one of the best experiences that my family and friends and I had in Dubai. I loved it!","5","2015-04"
"Meh - Describes it perfectly.......","Ok I have actually stopped here twice and only just got round to reviewing the hotel.
If you want pampering this is the place for you, however we were not allowed to bring our female friends (Some 25+ years older than us and white) back in to our room without a chaperone from the hotel as, and I quote, 'we think they may be prostitutes' really!!?? Is this what I am paying for? To hear the view of one of your staff as to my company? Erm no.
If you like being looked at and surrounded by visitors to your hotel (By the coach load)  Russians then visit here. If not go elsewhere.","1","2014-09"
"Simply the best","After living in Dubai for 4 years we stayed here as one final treat - and it didnt disappoint - even though we rocked up with only hand luggage and a few carrier bags we were treated with respect and grace. 

It was a real buzz being inside and looking out over Dubai after spending so many years looking at the outside.

All the hype surrounding this hotel is well founded - its simply the best and we felt ourself lucky to be able to experiance this wonderful hotel.","5","2014-07"
"Amazing views","The foyer is absolutely stunning, and we were greeted by the staff. We felt so welcome! The rooms have beautiful decor and are really spacious, comfiest lounge suite I have EVER sat on. 
Quiet floors, so you have privacy.
We had an amazing arabic lunch in their restaurant. All food was so fresh and delicious. Staff were so attentive, always had a fresh drink.","5","2015-04"
"Luxury Redefined","Since its a very famous and iconic place in the world therefore obviously your expectations
are very high and let me tell you that this place stands upto all. From the very moment of Airport pickup you can feel it. Entering into the hotel lets you in the golden world and the rooms are excellent. Talk about food, service, facilities i mean everything is top notch. But Great things come at a great price. So all this comes at a very high price. A must place to stay if one can. Seven Stars.","5","2015-01"
"SPECTACULAR!","Spectacular is the one word for the one and only 7-star hotel in the world!, Remember: to have a chance to enter in this outstanding hotel, you need a reservation in advance (room, lounge or restaurants) and then enjoy the luxury everywhere and the ultra kindly service!, excellence the more characteristic in Dubai!","5","2015-04"
"Truly Seven Star","Burj Al Arab - a true testament to luxury and good living. You also get free passes to lots of places like the Wild Wadi, the Jumeirah private beach. Amazing experience. I loved the shops in the Burj best of all.","5","2014-11"
"Afternoon Tea in Skyview Bar at Burj Al Arab","I booked this as a surprise for my husband's 50th birthday & we were not disappointed. What a fabulous experience. From arriving at the hotel until leaving, every staff member greeted us with a smile and the help and service we received was fantastic.  I must mention in particular our waiter Shelby who was so attentive and could not do enough for us, he was brilliant.  We requested a window seat but was aware they are popular and was informed at the time of booking that we might not get this.  We didn't, but I have to say, it didn't spoil the experience, we still had amazing views& other diners were happy to let us into their space to take photo's and also very kindly took photo's for us as did the staff.  The day was rounded off when my husband was presented with a beautiful birthday cake. Plus everyone received a gift of a stylish pen & chocolates, a lovely keepsake.
I would highly recommend afternoon tea at Burj Al Arab.  Thank you to all.","5","2015-04"
"Beautiful Atmosphere!","It was my 60th Birthday and I really wanted to relax and enjoy the Sky Tea that I had read about since we could not afford to stay at the Burj Al Arab, I did not want to go all the way to Dubai and not see it. It was an awesome experience just walking across the bridge taking in the views to get there. I enjoyed every minute as we were waited on from the moment we arrived. The lobby was beautiful with the fountains and the aquariums and as we approached the top of the escalators it was even more beautiful. We went to the 4:00 p.m. seating to enable us to experience the views overlooking the Persian Gulf in the daylight and the night time. Our 7 course meal was very delicious and filling! Our waiter was awesome! I forgot his name, but I have his picture! (I know, shame on us!) We were first to be seated and we had an awesome view at a table window. Make your reservations in advance, maybe a couple of months depending upon the time of year that you are going. Send an email to BAARestaurants@jumeirah.com to reserve your time. Arrive early to enable you to be seated at a table window as that cannot be confirmed upon reserving. It is first come, first serve. It's a little pricey at AED 620 per person but if you are going to Dubai, you have to do this! Don't miss it!! You will regret it later!","5","2015-02"
"Afternoon tea experience, the views blew me away!","Putting aside the pricy aspect - which it obviously was - this was an experience I will never forget. Came here in 2014 for afternoon tea, the service was immaculate, the staff were a little over professional if I say so myself, which I can imagine they need to be for such a luxury place! The food was good and filling, but it was the incredible views of Dubai's man-made islands that blew us away. We must have spent more time looking out the glass windows than anything else! A must do experience if you have the cash, but you can access these views from so many places around Dubai anyway, so do your research! ","4","2014-10"
"NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED","We got the cheapest possible room, it still cost waaaaaay too much, and it really wasn't worth it. The staff were excellent but there was no wow factor. It wasn't anything special, other than the price...","2","2015-03"
"Afternoon Tea not worth the price paid","My wife and I shared afternoon tea (coffee for me) at the Burj al arab recently. We had been reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we had high expectations, considering the significant price per person ($170USD) We had requested a window table and when we arrived at 4PM none were available While the service was good (not exceptional) the view was OK (again, not exceptional) the food was good (nothing special) we did not feel the value was there. I mean, how good can some tea, coffee, pastries and finger sandwiches actually be? They are what they are. And just how many pastries can one eat before you tire of them? The architecture is interesting and we did enjoy the experience, just not enough to justify the price. Would we do it again- no. Would I do it again knowing what the experience was like beforehand?- Not if I was paying the bill.","3","2015-04"
"Al Muntaha lunch.","I really want to express all my hapiness by having the opportunuty to have a lunch in this amazing place.From start to the end it was a stunning moment in paradise where perfection were anywhere.The service was kindly made by two person,and you can always feel that they really care about you and that they want to make you feel happy,pamppered,and very special.They do all they can do to let you live this unic expérience in the best way possible.The quality of the drinks and food was just incredibile,so fresh,so tasty and presented in such a fine and classy way.We had a window table ( as i had asked for when i booked for this lunch) with a view that left me speechless.This was an unforgettable expérience that i look forward to repeat soon.Thank you so much and last but not least,they gave us a birthday cake for my little girl birthday.Sublime Burj Al Arab.","5","2015-04"
"Afternoon Tea at the Burj Al Arab Jumerah","Tea at a 7-Star Hotel in Dubai for my Birthday....what an experience!  The ONLY way you can get access to the Burj Al Arab is to have a reservation for a room, a meal, or Afternoon Tea.  You must show your Reservation # to a guard before access to the hotel.  We made our reservations about a couple months ahead of time, and it was expensive for Afternoon Tea ($193 with tax and tip), but it was one of the best days EVER!  Tea was a 7-course affair that included the best iced coffee I have ever tasted.  You can order as many iced or hot coffees and teas as you wish.  They just keep bringing lucious food like a beef dish with smidgen of mashed potatoes, sandwiches, and goodies and scones, as much as you want.  We chose 4pm for Tea so we could also get great sunset pictures.  We were there until just after sunset, and then as we were leaving, we asked the doorman how to get to the gorgeous mall next door, and they took us over by golf cart, right through their sandy-beach grounds.  It was all-in-all one of the best vacation days ever!  Do it for a treat for yourself if you get to magical Dubai!","5","2015-03"
"Very classy","Obviously an excellent hotel, however didn't really fit in there as it was very high end and I just went for 2 nights as an experience. Every year I go to the sister hotel, the jumeirah beach which is fantastic. The service is incredible, especially here. You feel like a king in a two story room!! Brilliant hotel however, fascinating ","5","2015-04"
"Ultimate luxury","We are very happy to experience this luxury hotel. Everything was wow and perfect. We were celebrating my birthday. The hotel arranged a cake, flower and sweets with music as a surprise. Butler Syed and his team were outstanding. Special thanks to Olena from Guest relations who did all the arrangement for our stay. We would like to thank her for her time to show us around the hotel.","5","2015-04"
"Gold Gold Gold.....","This feels like you have entered Bappi Lahiri's mansion-people from India will know what I mean... There is Gold everywhere and flaunts the wealth of Dubai. The service is very prompt and they give you enough time to let the feeling sink in. The breakfast that was served was served well and the varities offered were nice. They have 3 types of menufor breakfats, namely- Arabic, English and Indian..!!!
Overall a good experience though 5500INR per pax for an experience is hefty","4","2014-12"
"Spoiled our 1st wedding anniversary....Thanks","I stayed there on 19th April 2015 in Room No. 704. We checked in at around 02:30 pm. The lady who checked us in was Ms. Youmna. On our check out she was giving an expression on my back as if we were unwanted and she was thanking God that we are leaving. She made the facial expression when my back was there towards her but my wife who was coming behind me noticed all this. A hotel with such a reputation should not humiliate their guests like this. Really disappointed and wud never like to goto a place where we are unwanted. This is not what we are paying you for. Thanks to her my entire memories have become sour. It was my first wedding anniversary. 

WORST EVER EXPERIENCE. NEVER FELT SO HUMILIATED IN MY LIFE.","1","2015-04"
"A good experience but won't be back","We stayed one night at Burj Al Arab and were expecting great things.  You are certainly greeted with utmost professionalism and service.  Upon arrival we were told that we are able to have a complimentary upgrade which was part of our package ""if available"".  Our suite was amazing and certainly had the wow factor with fantastic views over Dubai.  However we had specifically requested a non-smoking room and there was a definite smell of stale cigarettes about the place which you don't expect from a hotel of this standard.  We spent the afternoon in the spa and had a wonderful experience there with top class treatments and again amazing views from each treatment room.  We also went down to the private beach for a couple of hours which was lovely with waiters bringing iced drinks and complimentary snacks was a luxurious way to spend a couple of hours.
In the evening we booked to Dine at Al Mahara.  Its a spectacular setting although the food was decidedly average given the price tag.  Unfortunately we were also seated at the table at the end of the entrance tunnel that you see on the website and in the pictures and its also were everyone comes to have their photo taken and it doesn't seem like just the guests dining either as the night goes on they seemed to let people just come down for a look and take pictures which is fair enough if they want to do that but don't seat paying guests at the table as your have everyone backing up onto your table and also having your photo taken numerous times by strangers is not conducive to a relaxing evening.","3","2015-04"
"Like home!","We're almost 8 times in this exceptional hotel and it just gets better. Even with special needs and difficult tasks, everything works perfectly. The environment fit, fitness, childcare, food selection, room services, restaurantes, pool service... like a second home!","5","2015-04"
"Known as best in World for a reason...!","We stayed one night in Panoramic suite. Don't try and save £100 by staying in normal room, you'll regret it. We were transferring from Jumeirah Al Qasr and our own check-in hostess was waiting out the front for our arrival (as well as the ten doormen/bell). Then as we were checking in (in our suite) the manager came to personally introduced himself as did our butler. The sweeping staircase in the suite is ridiculous(ly brilliant). The range of complimentary Hermes toiletries inc wrapped full size bottles of perfume and aftershave etc must cost about $600 if you tried to buy it in the airport. 

The personal service around the pool (waiting staff come to each set of chairs every 30 mins with a new goody; sorbet, ice creams, Haribo(!) etc. all complimentary) is like nothing else I've ever experienced. The restaurant next to the massive aquarium (can't remember name off hand) is mind blowing. Go for a pre dinner drink in Sky Bar (get butler to book) and then get dedicated lift to 2nd floor for restaurant. Sitting outside for brekkie is amazing as well (although this meal is just excellent, rather than outstanding - go to Al Qasr Jumeirah for that). 

Yes there are tourists on ground floor and in atrium. Get used to it (although they've all paid to be there as your name needs to be on a list even to get over the road bridge to the hotel). 

The gym is very good and personal trainer likeable. 

Go with high expectations and have them surpassed (forget about the cost and you'll enjoy it more). If you're going to do the above expect £2,500 for room, drinks, breakfast, an AMAZING dinner and some lunch by the pool. Could do it a bit cheaper - but £2k would be a hell of a lot to spend on this hotel to restrict what you do.","5","2015-03"
"A SPECIAL HOTEL FOR A SPECIAL EVENT","My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 25 wedding anniversary in style and what better way to do it than to visit the only 7 star hotel in the world.  We booked ourselves in the hotel for the Junsi Asian 7 course Afternoon Tea, we had intended to go for the traditional afternoon tea however we booked on a Friday and unfortunately it was not available on a Friday, but this was a blessing in disguise.

We arrived at the Burj Al Arab and we were immediately taken in by the level of luxury that the hotel delivered, it was easy to see why it was 7 star, from the stunning location, the Rolls Royce's parked outside, and the opulent interior of the hotel perfect in every way.

Once we booked  in we were directed to the Junsi Restaurant and from this moment we were looked after perfectly, we virtually had the restaurant to ourselves, we were seated with a stunning view out to sea.

The 7 course meal was fantastic, each course explained to us and served perfectly by the restaurant staff, the standard of the dishes were amazing as was how they were presented.

At the end of the meal the hotel had kindly organised a beautiful cake in respect of our celebration which was a very kind token, unfortunately my wife and I were so full from our meal we could not even contemplate trying to eat it, however this was not an issue the staff promptly provided a Burj Al Arab take out box, how posh!!!!

After our meal we were able to spend some time in the hotel taking in the beauty of it all and working out when were were going to come and spend a few nights therel!!

The whole experience was worth every penny and I recommend coming to this fantastic hotel if you should visit Dubai its a must!!

I would like to thank all the Staff of the Burj Al Arab hotel and Junsi Restaurant for making our experience so memorable","5","2015-03"
"Sunday Tea","We stayed at the Jumeriah Emeriates, but went to Burj Al Arab for Sunday Tea.  The Tea lasts for three hours and was 7 courses of tea, wine and finger sandwiches, etc.  The staff was attentive and noticed I did not eat the berries they served during one of the courses.  I explained I had allergies and could not eat the berries they served.  They prepared sliced apples and pears for me. The price was about $175.00 per person US dollars.  Sounds pricey, but the experience was worth the cost.","5","2014-12"
"TOO MUCH HYPE AND DOESNT DELIVER","Having heard so much about the famous Burj Al Arab we decided to book for cocktails  and a bar meal.
While the property itself is stunning..
The Lounge fails to deliver...

My wife started with Oysters.. not a good idea.. she paid for that later in the evening, when we placed our order for food we asked for the hot food to be held back until my wife finished her oysters.. that fell on deaf ears..
My hot food was delivered anyway... which I sent back.. the waiter telling bluntly it would be placed under a hot light...!!!
When we did finally get our food.. Awful... ! My wife's Arabic Mezzah had been  microwaved and, stale, My burgers were dry and overcooked.. both meals sent back.. 

The staff  the lounge  while friendly,do not seem to be that well trained to serve in a such prestigious property..

My suggestion is.. don't bother unless its just a drink","3","2015-04"
"Amazing but expensive","Almost everything is perfect at this amazing hotel from in-suite check-in, private butler, express room service , luxury amenities , clean beach , amazing Sea and hotel indoor views from the rooms outdoor gallery definitely felt like a royal . But it's a bit overpriced specially the food you get a feeling that they try to take advantage of the status quo so to say of being Burj Al Arab the iconic 7 star hotel and all, in reality it's not much different from other top of the line 5 star hotels . No hotel can be classified more then 5 stars . I would say the real advantage this hotel has is its location and the beautiful views I got specially of the sea and the sunset with llying down on the extra comfortable bed in the room and watching myself on the mirror above","4","2015-04"
"Probably the most amazing and luxurious stay I have ever experienced.","What an amazing place. The rooms were beautiful, staff were friendly and attentive, food was amazing...overall, incredible experience. It's very big and grand and you have to be prepared to experience something different, but it still manages to keep a relaxed and comfortable attitude. You can't really fault it.","5","2015-01"
"Perfect evening!","My wife & I had the pleasure of dining at the Al Muntaha Restaurant located on the 27th floor at Burj al Arab. 
The staff was very friendly and professional starting from the greeting, when the elevator door opened at the 27th floor to the pleasant and observant waiter(s) and the knowledgeable sommelier. They all have a great sense of humor, which makes the dinning more relaxed and enjoyable.   
The food was absolutely amazing, kept in simple presentations but with a world of flavors.
It was my wife’s birthday and she was surprised with a birthday cake, a red rose and a song from the live band. All gestures which made us feel among good friendly people, who are really passionate about their job. 
I find it very easy to give Al Muntaha Restaurant my best recommendation.

"Afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab","What an experience.  We had prebooked our afternoon tea in the Skyview restaurant at this amazing hotel. Once we had shown the guard at the gate our reservation number we were allowed into the inside. The grandeur and opulence of the inside was a stark surprise from the outside.  Colour and gold everywhere and amazing aquariums on both sides going up the escalators. The afternoon tea in it self was an experience where we were serviced champagne and seven courses of delights. With the views overlooking the palm or dubai itself the whole afternoon was one to remember  for the rest of my life. ","5","2015-04"
"You cannot fault it in anyway","Friendly welcome from the tallest bell boy I've ever seen.  All rooms are suites basically and furnished in a spectacular fashion - wasted on me really but as a unique hotel that isn't as outrageously priced as you may think (e.g. £1,000 a night) it's well worth a stay just for three nights.  Nothing really else to say except just book it; have the experience and enjoy each moment!","5","2015-03"
"Classe","Great, elegant and professional all the way. We visited Sky View bar and are very impressed. Great food and drinks in a very nice place with wonderful viewes. All of the stuff was kindly and professional","5","2015-03"
"It's an experience","I'll start out by saying the only reason we had dinner here is because it was a business dinner and another couple picked the location.
We ate at Al Mahara, which does have a lovely aquarium setting.  Service was impeccable.  The food was extremely over priced and wasn't that impressive.  I had sea bass that wasn't anything extraordinary, my partner had a steak.  The couple we were with both had fish as well.  I had one of the cheaper glasses of wine for $80 US.  It was a full dinner - appetizers, main course, desserts, drinks.  The tab was $2200 US.  
With that being said, it is something to experience if you can.  The hotel and ambiance of it all is different.  Just not something most can repeat often ;)","3","2014-11"
"Afternoon tea at sky bar 13:00","We arrived early to look at the common areas - not allowed without reservation - and to get best window seating. The hotel is amazing, the Sky bar on top provided perfect few of Dubai and the sea. The ambience superb - enjoyed the live music played by an Ukrainian pianist. The service was immaculate. The food was a plentiful lunch also for my big eater husband (first cake, then sandwiches of which you can get many helpings as the waiters come around offering extra many times, sorbet to cleanse the palate, then sweets) - we were stuffed. We got a glass of champaigne and a big choice of tea and coffee. If someone had an event (anniversary, etc.) they got a suprise bouquette. The meal ended when we got a beautifully packed pen and high quality chocolates as a gift. One of the high points of visiting Dubai, very pleasant experience, definitely recommneded at least as a once-in-a-lifetime experience.","5","2015-03"
"Cream Tea Experience","Don't bother! Completely overpriced!
I did this with a group for a friends special birthday. Service was good, facilities good but for the price we paid nothing special. 
You get 4 finger sandwiches each, which were a bit dry. 2 scones again not very fresh, runny jam and not enough cream and it wasn't even clotted cream. Cakes were ok, except one which was chocolate case with yogurt inside!?
It's a shame they hadn't bothered to find out what a good English cream tea consists of.","3","2015-04"
"Honeymoon","I don't know whether trip advisor accept reviews from a few years back so please feel free to not publish if this is the rule. Visited here on honeymoon almost 10 years ago now but will have to add to say it really is a fine hotel. We were on honeymoon and we also booked the afternoon tea they offered which was to die for. The under sea aquarium was also very impressive. Our stay here was short as we we stayed at the Hilton jumeirah beach primarily but can recommend the burj upon our short stay ","4","2015-04"
"Dinner for One","Had the opportunity to go to the Burj Al Arab for dinner whilst staying in Dubai. Opted for the traditional Arabian dinner which was served in the restaurant on the 1st floor looking back at Jumeirah Hotel. Good meal but not the exceptional flavours that I had expected from the 7* hotel. The buffet starter was actually better than the main course.","4","2015-03"
"A Luxurious Evening","Booked a the late seating at the Sky Bar for Afternoon Tea on a visit with my mother and sister. The food and service were both exceptional.  The Burj Al Arab was the first stop on our 7 day adventure and we were not disappointed.  The food served at the ""high tea"" was more than enough for our dinner since all the items were rich and luxurious. The staff went above and beyond by taking pictures of the three of us together in different areas of the restaurant. Unfortunately, there was a sand storm during our visit so the views were limited, however this did not dampen our experience. The food and staff alone were worth the price of admission. While visiting for tea, you can also tour the lobby level of the hotel which is a beautiful experience in itself. You can only visit the Burj Al Arab hotel with a dining or hotel reservation and high tea at the Sky Bar is definitely the way to go if a hotel stay is not in your budget.","5","2015-02"
"best hotel ive ever stayed at - been coming back for past 10 years","Ignore the reviews on the restaurants or bad ones, this hotel is honestly amazing. Ive been coming to the burj for the past 14 years, normally twice a year or more and i cannot fault it. You get treated like royalty, the rooms are stunning, the service is amazing. Its honestly worth the so called '7 stars'. Amjad, one of the beach workers is the nicest and most helpful member of staff, he makes my trip so special! I would highly recommend!!","5","2014-05"
"must see but expected more","This hotel is unique, its architecture is still amazing, the entrance and the inside shine, the service at first impression is also top class, friendly and professional. 
Rooms are refined and view is great (if you are on seaside view).
Still we were expecting more.
More in the service and more in the food quality. Mostly it is average, with of course some high end choices in the wines and the champagnes, and in some presentations (seafood, oysters etc), but we had better meals at the nearby hotel and even downtown, for less money.
The other negative part is the traffic to get there and the presence of tour buses with group of tourists visiting the hotel as a museum (or worse). If they want to keep the unique allure of exclusivity they should limit these tours or find a less apparent way.
It is a must see if you are in Dubai but could be more.","4","2015-01"
"Sky bar","Try the sky bar! 
We were there for an afternoon tea. The food was fancy, good and more than enough. For a romantic date is perfect and you can see the inside.

You have to book is before 2-3 weeks.....","4","2014-09"
"Wow, wow and wow !","Yes it's expensive and yes it's over the top but it's just one of those things that you should do if you visit Dubai and you have the opportunity.

Bentleys, Lambos and cheap Porsches on the front tell you what to expect - wall to wall bling !

The entrance lobby is amazing with its water feature and gold coloured everything then the first floor lobby with its high end jewellers with no customers, and very attentive and courteous staff.

The glass walled lift to the 27th floor is great and at the top you're welcomed like royalty and shown to your seat.

The feast begins with champagne and a small fruit pastry, followed by a savoury dish then a sorbet before the second half of finger sandwiches and a rack of cakes all washed down with masses of tea of any type you can think of !

To top it all they gave my wife a rose and another cake as we were celebrating our 29th anniversary.

This really does oversimplify the whole event but suffice to say that we left having feasted on some of the most wonderful food and in the most wonderful of surroundings.

Not to be missed 😄","4","2015-04"
"Interesting","If you want to pay $5,000 a night, you can actually go inside.  Otherwise, it is an interesting building to view.  It is the world's only 7 star hotel...the beach near it is not the greatest.  We were there in March and it was not too crowded but it was just not a pretty beach.","3","2015-03"
"Beautiful place. loved it","we went here for breakfast.t the amount of food was amazing. the quality of food was even better. the service impeccable. they truly put you first and are willing to do anything to make it pleasurable for you. i would recommend this to everyone!","5","2014-12"
"High Tea- Sahn Eddar","Although High Tea at Sahn Eddar is expensive, my husband and I thought the service made it worth every penny. We came for a portion of our honeymoon. We were given a rose and a pen with chocolates. This was a nice touch and made our time even more memorable. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and explained every course with great detail. The staff was also engaging and personable. Thank you for the memorable experience!","5","2015-03"
"Overpriced  and poor quality food ","I treated myself and my partner to lunch and while the hotel and the view from the restaurant was spectacular, the food was disappointing. Linguine with prawns was a joke. A small roll of linguine with only 2 prawns resting against it left me some what bemused considering the price  and the chateaubriand  was more crucified than cooked. Served with the smallest portion of overdone vegetables that I have ever come across.
If this is 7 star quality  then give me the local kebab shop anytime.
All in all a total disgrace  and I can say that I  would certainly not eat there again  but the views were good. ","3","2014-04"
"STUNNING!","An OUTSTANDING treat! It really has to be ""a treat"" because tea at £301 is, to me anyway!...a treat price!....BUT it was worth the it!
It was an EXPERIENCE....tea...in the sky! In STUNNING surroundings with the most attentive staff possible!....WITHOUT being TOO attentive!
We were escorted to the 27th floor and were greeted with a smile....our table was waiting for us!
The 6 course menu was outlined to us and we chose to compliment it with a glass of Champagne!....we had another during tea....which, of course, edged the total price up...but....we were at the Burj Al Arab...a very spoily place....when in Rome!...
Tea was a delightful mixture of sandwiches (however many you wanted!),cakes, scones, a little (warm ) curried beef dish and completed with a mouthwatering sorbet!
We have nothing but praise for this experience....and look forward to doing it again....one day!","5","2015-03"
"Cocktails at Sky view bar","What a fantastic eve once again! 
Took my mum to have cocktails here again and it was just as amazing as our previous visits. The view over the city is unbelievable both in the day and the night. 
A massive 'Thank you' to two special people ....Eranda and Mr Falil.  
Thank you so much for making our visit so special yet again!
See you soon 😆","5","2015-03"
"Arabic Hospitality","On the 25th March I visited the Burj Al Arab for High Tea at the Sky Bar on the 27th floor. I had been advised that it was necessary to book a week in advance during busy times and was not holding out much hope to secure a booking. I turned up at 13:45 and had a place reserved at 16:00 that same day. On entering the hotel at 15:45 I was greeted by smiles and welcomes from every member of staff that I saw. There was an air of grandeur about the place and I felt as though this was going to be a highlight of an already good trip (I’d travelled to Melbourne for the Grand Prix, had been to Sydney and on the morning of the 25th had been to the top of the Burj Khalifa). On arriving at the 27th floor I was shown to my seat which had stunning views of the Palm and Atlantis Hotel on the left and Burj Khalifa on the right. I felt like a king as I drank Champagne and my every need was met. I had been asked if I was celebrating any special occasion and I happened to mention that I had celebrated my birthday the week before.  I was pleasantly surprised to be served a birthday cake wished a belated happy birthday. I was also thanks for choosing to celebrate with them. Many places would have over played it to the point of being embarrassing but not here. It was done with a subtlety that made me feel very special. It was the perfect experience of world famous Arabic hospitality.","5","2015-03"
"Afternoon Tea fit for royalty!","What an amazing and memorable experience. From the first welcome to the farewell, afternoon tea in the sky view bar is a first class, luxurious, fantastic and unique experience. As you might expect service is out of this world. The staff are delightful. The food is highly enjoyable and the views are stunning. If we win the lottery I'm going back for two weeks!! ","5","2015-03"
"Impressive hotel. Great stay. Staff very careful to little details. Loved it!","I truly enjoyed my stay at Jumeirah. It is a big impressive building. The room we had was amazing - very recomended to get a room in the top floors for the breathtaking view. Breakfast was really good and comprehended a big variety of hot and cold buffet. The service is top notch and the bartenders close to the pool could not be more helpful. The only think that I would improve is the pool area - it has a big potential and with a more modern design would just be perfect. Great pick to spend some few days in Dubai - not a cheap option, but great value for the money.","5","2014-08"
"Afternoon Champagne Tea","An experience not to be missed!! 

Fantastic food overlooking the Arabian Gulf own personal waiter amazing surroundings expensive but worth every penny to drive over the white bridge and then onto the glass elevator for 32 floors never to be forgotten","5","2015-03"
"Do not miss Friday brunch","I've experience brunch at Al Muntana Restaurant twice now, and will definitely return everytime I'm in Dubai. 

A wonderful experience. 
Excellent food, views and service. 
Expensive but so worth the price.","5","2014-09"
"Royal Suite - Prodigious & Wondrous!","We arrived at Dubai International Airport at around 2am.  Many airports in the world are at a standstill at this time but not Dubai!  This airport operates 24/7 and it is clearly visible, people everywhere!  Although busy clearing immigration and getting to the baggage check was quick.

Jumeirah has their own welcome office in the arrivals hall on the left hand side.  Not surprisingly it is the largest of all the hotels reception areas that offer this facility.  Because it was such a crazy time to arrive, we were keen to keep moving and get to the hotel.  As were escorted outside, the beginning of our unbelievable experience began - two identical white Phantom Rolls Royce, one for each couple in our party!  Each of the ladies were presented with a beautifully wrapped bouquet of roses which were displayed in tissue paper bearing the Burj Al Arab's logo elegantly printed all over it.  The only difference between the two Phantoms was a numeric digit on the number plate.

The drive to the Burj Al Arab was around 25 minutes and of course one enjoys extreme comfort in the immaculately clean motor vehicles.

On arrival at Burj Al Arab around 3am the hotel was now somewhat quiet, no complaints here!

On arrival at the suite with a full entourage of staff made up of receptionists and butlers the two large dark wood double doors were opened and we walked into what can only be described as one of the most gorgeous and magnificent entrances of any hotel suite anywhere in the world.  We were immediately taken aback by the beautiful yellow stone and the bright colors of the purple and red drapes.  The entrance is large and quite breathtaking and the center piece is a twenty-four carat gold leaf wide staircase with a leopard print carpet that leads up to 50% of elevation of this grand foyer, and then the staircase divides to the left and the right and wraps around itself ending on the upper level.

It is certainly a moment where you have to let time stand still and embrace the sheer beauty of what is still, in essence, just a hotel suite and yet far more than that!  At this point the four of us were being fussed around with butlers offering up everything from heated hand towels, Arabic tea, fruit juices, wine or champagne!

Off the one side of the grand entrance is an elevator to the second level and a lounge and TV room complete with bathrooms and separate loo's and on the other side of the grand entrance is the dining room, kitchen and study also with separate bathroom.  The whole feel to this two level Royal Suite is that of a mini-palace.  It is around 780 square meters, around 7500 square feet and it is truly gorgeous!! The colors are warm, rich and vibrant all at the same time, the materials used from carpeting to wall coverings are exquisite, the overall feeling is one that leaves you wondering if it can get any better than this?

The upstairs area is divided into two spaces separated by the gorgeous staircase and a walkway that overlooks the entrance.

Both bedrooms are huge!  They enjoy different but beautiful color combinations.  The bathrooms are simply off the charts!  Full sized Jacuzzi's, massive walk in shower, toilet and bidet, twin basins, ladies vanity area, marble everywhere, stunning colors!!  So many people talk about the full size Hermes amenities in each of the bathrooms!  That is of course an amazing touch, not seen in our many years of travel anywhere else in the world!!  Since it's the Burj Al Arab two bathrooms in a Royal Suite would just simply not be enough.  Off the study downstairs is another full bathroom offering the same Hermes amenities and next to the dining room is a half bathroom with toilet, bidet and basin.  On the other side of the staircase off the lounge area is another half bathroom with toilet, bidet and basin.

Perhaps one of my favorite spaces in the whole suite and definitely worth a mention is the highly decorated Majlis style lounge.  This was connected to the second bedroom and is one of the most comfortable lounge areas you can imagine.  This also doubles up as a theatre room and is very spacious and colorful.

Another room that is most certainly deserving of special mention is the dining room.  It enjoys an impressive, round natural wood dining table with seating for 12 and, of course, since this is the Burj Al Arab these are just not any seats, the seats are high backed chairs with vibrant and colorful fabric.  We decided over the four days that we would use this exceptionally well and enjoyed some fabulous en-suite dining.  Most lunches and dinners were enjoyed in the Royal Suite.  Our thinking was if you have this kind of space in a suite of this caliber why would you leave to dine in a restaurant?

We must give a shout out to the room service staff, or as they call it en-suite dining!  They arrived some 20 minutes before you expect your food and they lay out the table like a 5 star restaurant.  The staff are white gloved, immaculately dressed, discreet and exceptionally polite and when the food was served everything was perfectly prepared every time.  The unique touch and certainly of a world class standard is the fact that they do not depart during your dining experience, we always had at least one attendant standing to one side in case anything was needed from an extra square of butter to further bread or sides or whatever!  They were attentive to top up water and soda glasses or re-fill soup bowels or present the next course.  To say that this was a touch of class would be an understatement, this was profoundly and unquestionably the best in-room dining experience ever!

A nice touch in what is often considered the Master Bedroom is the revolving bed.  Very unusual and not really understood why it is there but in the earlier days of the hotel the TV was in such a position in a cabinet that the bed needed to be angled for preferred viewing.  They have made some improvements in recent years and the TV is now concealed in the ceiling and you are able to drop the TV down and view comfortably and in the regular position the bed is prepared for viewing, however you are able to make fine adjustments to your angle to make sure you get the best viewing possible!!  What can we say about that??

The dressing rooms off both bedrooms were generous in size and had all the bells and whistles and we love the beach bags that are provided in Burj Al Arab.  They have a zipper on them and those always make it all the way back home filled to the brim with Hermes products!!

A last word about the beds, they are simply the best beds we have ever slept in!  They offer a pillow menu as well as a mattress menu!!  and they will change the mattress for you if you are that particular, but in our visits to Burj Al Arab it has always been an incredible delight to sink into their bed at whatever time day or night and into the most incredibly comfortable pillows and we'll see in the morning!!

Another great space worthy of individual mention is the study on the lower level.  I used this exclusively for my party to keep up with business matters and the space here was superb whilst being private and quiet!  They have a lop top with printer and this became the home office during our visit.  The colors in here are also gorgeous and off this study is a full bathroom so one can really get work done and remain business wise quite functional in these lovely accommodations.

We would like to make special mention to Ms Stephanie, Director of Operations for Butlers, she looked after the four of us in the highest standards one could possibly imagine.  She continually checked in with us and had her team make sure every request no matter how small, medium or large in demand was met with the standards associated with such a fine property.  Well done and thanks Ms Stephanie!

What is amazing is that the Burj Al Arab is no longer a new hotel, now more than one decade old, they deserve kudos for maintaining the interior of their suites as if they were built yesterday.  The Royal Suite other than marginal wear and tear on carpets and other fabric areas was in an impeccable condition!  What a great standard they have attained and maintained.

We were celebrating my friends birthday, one we are sure he will simply never forget!  Thank you Burj Al Arab and viva Jumeirah!","5","2014-09"
"Must see. Don miss it.","Burj Al Arab is a must see for anyone visiting dubai.  The location the architect the reastaurants and the aquarium. I have traveled a lot and seen a lot and I make sure to visit at least one of there restaurants every time I visit dubai. Make sure you have dinner at the maharra restaurant it's worth it.","5","2015-03"
"Amazing Bar & Staff !!!","Me and my wife have been for our Honeymoon in Dubai and we have visited Sky Bar. The ambience was perfect but we have been more impressed from the staff! All of them were very polite and had the ""know How"" of their job description... Especially Mr. Nalaka the Bar Manager!","5","2015-02"
"One for the 'Bucket List'","We went for afternoon tea to celebrate my birthday.  It was sooo memorable. The staff made a big thing of it. I felt like Royalty. The food was served over a couple of hours - which we love. It was absolutely delicious. We were very full afterwards ...","5","2015-03"
"Super Tea!","We booked on line and arrived earlier than the 4.30pm we requested but this didn't cause the slightest stir. We made our way across the bridge in our local taxi and took our time to walk through the hotel foyer and despite having high expectations were still amazed at how current the hotel still appears. We took numerous photographs. The Skyview Bar reception was great and the lift journey even better. We were seated dead centre looking out to sea. (No request was made on the day of our visit) The staff whilst working to a tight timetable managed to put us at ease and to feel totally relaxed. The food was of a very good standard and the only odd departure was starting with a berry tart! The scones were exceptional and sandwiches were interesting. We were offered additional sandwiches and pastries but there was little need as we were comfortably full at the end.
The live music was excellent but could have lasted longer. The supply and offer of soft drinks and teas and coffees was endless and we found the iced Macadamia flavored coffee really good. We were put under no pressure to leave and were left to walk through the public areas and shops at our leisure. The indoor fountain on the first floor is well worth a look.
Our Bill was 1240 Dhiram for two all as advertised. We walked back across the bridge and took numerous memorable photos before heading for drinks at the neighboring Madinat Jumeirah. Though for us a real treat I would recommend without any hesitation!

"one of must do things in Dubai, stay at Burj Al Arab","To those who plan to visit Dubai, Please do not forget to put staying at Burj Al Arab on your must do thing list, it makes your trip in Dubai complete. Do not be one of people who regretted for not staying at the most luxury hotel in the world, since you've traveled all way to Dubai. 
My son and myself had an extremely dreamlike stay there. Not just because of every detail of facilities that they determine to be the No.1 splendid Hotel in the world and the breath taking view that we enjoyed, more over, the all they employees who dealt with were professional and are proud of working there, they try their best to serving all the quest who stay at their hotel, and keep it up with the remarkable Hotel- Burj Al Arab.
It is one of must do things in Dubai! Never compromise for the secondary hotel, such as Atlantis the XXXX, as compared to Burj Al Arab, they are not even close in all aspects. Save money for Burj Al Arab when you plan to visit Dubai, it worth every penny that  you spend."" Who will visit Dubai again for Burj Al Arab.","5","2015-02"

"Luxury","It is a place    where probably  i won' t   be   there   often ... As  yes is expensive    but   its a thing where u must  go   to spoil  urself    at least  once in a lifetime    my opinion.
 Having personal  butler 24 hr   is a  nice  experience .... i was there some  years  ago(5 i think ) in xmas time ...Once they knew was  my  bday i  got   around 5  bday  cakes ..(  yummy ones)  from all  departments .... Really they know how to make u  feel awesome ...Also the  underwater  restaurant is    great   mostly  for the  way  u get  there .... ;)
 The only thing i was  disspointed   was that   u wont find   many  shops in that hotel .. are just  2 or  3  except the suvenir  one ..Also the restaurant from the last  floor is something to  see and  just stay  in the evening and  enjoy   a drink    and see  the  nice  view . The  spa  is  wonderful  also  and    so many  types  of services 

 Food is awesome ... the lounge  is  lovely  and  the rooms ..well  are not   simple rooms    are  like apartments  as u must   get  up one  flor to get  in the bedroom .. as  down   is   the living and  the bar ,.,,

  i recommand it  from my heart","5","2014-04"

It has been the only hotel that it is better than the photos. Suites are impressive,  stuff very polite and discreet. Spa on 27th floor amazing with unique view, turkish bath and sauna on same level with window watching over wonderful dubai. Food is very good and coctails really tasty with plenty tasteful recipies. Although it is said people to be elegant dressed,so many people there arent and lower the place. Anyway for sure i will go again and again.

"Afternoon Tea","It doesn't take or need a long wordy review - it's very simple..... 

Great views, fantastic food and brilliant service! Highly recommend. 

Burj Al Arab lived up to it's reputation and some. What an amazing place, with equally impressive, well trained employees.

Thanks for an amazing experience - one for the memory bank ..... although we will definitely return!","5","2015-03"
"Unique place, but lacks a soul and terribly overpriced, despite all the gold.","The Burj Al Arab claims to be the only seven-star hotel in the world, even though the ratings system only goes up to five. 
Overall, awkward vibe to the place. 

Prices (food, drinks, rooms) are ridiculous, and you constantly have to travel to enjoy the beach or the Madinat. 
The ultra bling design is dated and hurts the eyes. 

As you enter, the Your Guest Services liaison tells you that every gold-colored surface you see during your stay is actual twenty-four-karat gold. Even those four-story columns? Even so, she says. Even the thick fourth-story arcs the size of buses that span the columns? All gold. 
What surprised us most is it seemed a major issue to get a table at the Sky Bar, only to find it empty. Then, asking for food, being told ""the kitchen just closed"". 
""Can you not bring room service?"". No. 

I'm sorry, so a 7-star hotel cannot serve you food at 11:45 pm, while they should arrange for it to be served anywhere we would want, even at 4am. 
After lengthy talks, we ended up downstairs in the huge empty lobby (why they could not bring the dinner upstairs is a mystery) eating very subpar, very expensive food. 

In the end, the hotel seemed totally ""empty"" while in high season, lacks a soul, and you just don't feel comfortable there. Dar Al Masyaf or any other Jumeirah resort is a much better, and affordable, choice.","2","2014-12"
"Expensive but worth it for the experience","This is an absolutely amazing place
We stopped in a Panoramic Suite for 2 nights and the furnishings ,views, bathroom and the apartment itself were out of this world
We wished we had some friends stopping nearby to show it off !
Everything is spot on - the butler service is great -they are there if you want them but not intrusive
They give you a cool box of water when you arrive at the pool or beach and look after you really well -everyone is friendly
A La Carte restaurants are even more ridiculous money but you only do it once !
The toiletries are amazing and you definitely have to take those home
Hope we can stay again some time but will have to save up !","5","2015-03"
"Culinary Flight","We dined at the Burj Al Arab for the ""Culinary Flight"".  It is a a four course brunch, each course at a different restaurant.  It gives one the chance to sample the delights this only 7 start hotel in the world has to offer.  The gold you see is REAL.  The caviar you get is Beluga.  You can celebrity watch from the balcony level overlooking the lobby entrance, while enjoying French pastry and savory desserts and cafe au latte.  Watch  traffic jams between Rolls Royce and Ferraris.  

Service is impecable.  The views are a dreamscape.  This property comes with a hefty price tag, so don't expect to get away cheap.

"Service for some but not for others","I booked the Sahn Edar for High Tea in the Burj Al Arab for a treat for my daughters birthday. The booking online was easy. Having recently viewed a TV programme I assumed we would be greeted at the entrance with fresh towels and rose water. This did not happen to us. Whilst sitting at reception there looked like a bit of a panic, the gatehouse must have phoned ahead to say an important couple were approaching,  staff scurried about for a tray of fresh towels and rose water to greet this couple. No one else got this greeting. 
For High Tea we were offered sparkling wine or the more expensive option of champagne. I chose champagne however the waiter started to pour sparkling wine. Watch out for this!!!!  I received a feedback survey by e mail the following day using the title MR. My husband has recently died and the booking had been made in the name of MRS. Shocking error.!!!
The hotel is beautiful but service definitely not 7 STAR.","2","2015-03"
"Fabulous afternoon tea, but not the best in Dubai.","My daughter bought me here as a treat for Mother's Day, she lives in Dubai and I was visiting.
The hotel it's self is very grand, unfortunately we could not be accommodated in the sky bar so we settled for the first floor lobby which was very pleasant, however I did not find the staff as attentive as expected and had to ask for more tea, also a little embarrassing when they bought me a little cake with a candle and sang happy birthday, it was not so, didn't have the heart to mention it. 
On my last visit I took afternoon tea at the atmosphere bar at the top of the. Burj Khalifa located in the Armani hotel, not only was it a little cheaper, the service was better and the selection of food amazing and of course the view. Sadly the Burj Al Arab was not as good.","4","2015-03"
"This hotel has gone down hill!","We arrived on a Thursday for a 3 night mini break with our two children aged 9 & 10. We got checked in early and got a lovely suite with panoramic views - which is what we paid for. We have visited Dubai over 40 times and visited the Burj more than five times. This time we booked the half board package which included breakfast and lunch. No drinks were included, not even for the children and the water was over priced but free in your suite! There were errors with our bill which was annoying as we had settled it once the night before only to be hassled at 5am as we had been under charged £60 for our drinks at lunch! Not what you need at that time! The taxi we booked was late which meant rushing around last minute. You had to ask for the kids menus at lunch. The kids were not acknowledged and there were no kids packs on arrival which is a shame considering the amount we paid for the break. The buffet dinners were very average and you get better at the local five star hotels. Upon checkout the night before we were not even asked if we had a good stay. The team were too busy trying to get our credit card swiped! The Burj was once a national treasure but has been left behind as the world has moved on. The butler service is a waste of time too. The spa was of an excellent standard and even though it was over priced it was okay. The hair salon is not good, I had my eyebrows shaped - I have one and half eyebrows left! She has wrecked my eyebrows and I paid 100 dhs for the privilege! We are back in Dubai in four months and will be staying at a neighbouring five star resort and spa to receive the Arabian hospitality we are accustomed to. Burj you have let us down and didn't live up to minimum standards of customer service. Worth a visit if you have money to burn and low expectations. What a shame.","3","2015-03"
"Literally gold medal!","A lifetime experience! 

Elegance & luxury is an understatment ! Stayed here a couple of days ago with a group of friends for one night after 4 nights in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. After hearing so much about this luxurious hotel, we wanted to see what it was all about and finish our holiday in style.
The suites are something like I have never seen before, the attention to detail is superb! We stayed in a 2 bed suite and did not use all the rooms! Each floor has their own reception...
A special thank you to our butler Kelly for all his help with our many requests....
We tried the afternoon tea in the sky bar but would not recommend this..had better afternoon teas in London when looking at price/quality. However, the Al Mahara (Aquarium) is a must try! Would recommend trying out this fabulous restaurant, service, food and ambience is excellent! 
Overall a lifetime time experience!
A huge thank you to Burj Al Arab/Jumeirah Team for making our holiday so special!!","5","2015-03"
"Crazy Blue","Stayed there few months ago , that I rememeber. And what can I say. Mashallah Mashallah and Mashallah. SERVICE was brilliant. I felt like a sheikh entering in , giving me coffee and dates.. Welcoming me all different angles of the lobby. Wanted to call my self that day a Sheikh of the amazing service.100/100

Checkin was very smooth and the ladies were very kind and always smiling and wishing me a grate stay. That was a first feeling that I got from Burj al Arab. 10/10

Rooms are brilliant gold with blue color and more rich colored added in with the touch of Arab royals. The butler was very kind offering us  some fresh juices and a small welcoming cake that was my favourite. The bed was amazing and comfy . Just wanted to stay in bed and watch the amazing 7 Star View from my standard Room. I can just say the TVs are just small. It needs the 60 inchs inserted in to make it ""Woow"". But overall it was amazing stay with the welcoming me in my name on the screen... I felt like living here. 

Check-out was Wooow. No idea how it actually it started. Just had to sign and check my bill and that's it. No extra amenities or last mintue used or took. 

But what can I say..... Burj Al Arab is a Crazy Blue Hotel***** Blue is my Favourite colour 😍 Mashallah to Burj al Arab","5","2014-04"
"overly overrated and overpriced hotel !!!","We decided to visit  Dubai and what better place to stay than at the Burj Al Arab ????? Well save your money and stay elsewhere ......The hotel is beautiful but not something out of this world....so you would expect the service to be impeccable right???? Well far from it ...my partner spoke very little English so we asked for a butler that spoke Spanish and to our surprise they did not have one???? In our case it really didint matter because I could easily translate for my partner.  But just think what others would have to go thru after paying that type of money.  Everything that we asked for was not fulfilled for one  reason or other,,,.of course always in a very polite manner.  The seafood restaurant was also over priced and the food was not that great.  The sky bar was another dissappointment....save your money just go for drinks during the day so you could see the view,,,,,,,,","3","2014-09"
"Spectacular views & great service","A beautiful afternoon tea followed by lots of cocktails! 
Tea was wonderful. Don't eat on the day if you plan tea here! 
Food was in abundance & staff wonderfully attentive. The quality of food was out of this world & replenished constantly! 
A window table would have been preferable but we still got some good views. 
After tea, we retired to the bar & had some cocktails. Some were from the list & some not! The bar staff were wonderful. 
Drinks were a little on the high price, but for quality & service, well worth it for a day out. 
Would definitely return here. ","5","2015-03"
"Mothers Day Afternoon Tea","Afternoon tea with my Mum for Mothers Day was spent in the Sahn Edar Lounge of the Burj Al Arab.
I live in Dubai so had saved this visit for someone special. I'd been in the hotel some 12 years ago and was pleased to see it was as I remembered.
I don't think it's the most beautiful hotel in the world but it certainly has something about it.
The service as you would expect was faultless from start to finish. All needs were met with warmth and expertise from entrance to exit.
The Afternoon tea is expensive at £110 per head. Is it worth £110 each? In all honesty no but it is an experience and it really was lovely.
I don't think the tea itself is the best I've ever had and it certainly cannot compare to The Ritz or The Dorchester in London but it was good. 
We had a wonderful afternoon which will be well remembered. Definitely nice to say you've been there but probably not worth a regular visit.
","4","2015-03"
"Cocktails? Just do it!","We stayed at the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, and went for evening drinks at the 27th floor Sky View Lounge. For three weeks before we went to Dubai, we couldn't decide whether or not to go to the Burj for cocktails while we were there; minimum spend AED 350 (£65) per person which buys you approx 2 drinks each could never be described as a value evening out. Eventually, we decided sod it, let's go. What a great experience! Just do it, you won't regret it. You will need to get your concierge to make a reservation, as you can't just pitch up without one. We went on a Wednesday after dinner at about 10pm - really good atmosphere without being overcrowded. The Manager is very efficient, and allocates window tables in strict order of who arrived when, so don't worry if you start off at the bar, when it's your turn, you will get a window table.","5","2015-03"
"Breakfast in Sahn Eddar","How disappointing can a 7-star hotel be?  I visited on Mothering Sunday with visitors from the UK.  There was no one to greet us on arrival or to direct us to the restaurant.  On finding the mezzanine we waited to be seated but eventually had to approach a waiter as we were being ignored.  20 minutes after being shown to our table I then received a call from the Burj Al Arab asking why we were not in the restaurant!!  
The food was lovely and the waiters were jolly and polite but pretty absent.  For a 7-star hotel and the cost of the breakfast I would have expected to have a waiter hovering the entire time we were eating, for our tea to be poured for us, for our plates to be replenished should we require it, or at least to be asked.
As a resident in Dubai I will only visit the hotel with visitors who want to say ""I've been to the Burj Al Arab"" but frankly the service is better in the various restaurants in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and at a fraction of the price...  Very poor","3","2015-03"
"Amazing Trip At Burj Khalifah","This is the place everyone should see once in a life time. They made it a place which takes away your breathe.I was with my family here. The rooms, the views, the staff, the pleasure and peace, food and services all those thing i got in this hotel i can't ever get in another place on this planet.

"I Wasn't Seeing the Emperor's New Clothes at the cheaper high tea...","I went for the cheaper high tea at the first floor lobby (approx $160 canadian) and was very disappointed with the food.  Of course the surroundings were excellent and I knew I wouldn't get much food but the food I did receive was dismal.  The sandwiches sucked and the pastries weren't very fresh.  I've had much better high tea for $30 at many other places.  I had thought the food would be incredible so I was very disappointed.  I would actually give the food itself a 1/10.  However... the live instrumental band was great and the staff were all superb ~ especially the manager.  I would never do this high tea again.","2","2015-03"

"Absolutely amazing!!!","The experience of a lifetime!!! Amazing staff!!! Rooms kept clean and new. State of the art amenities. Amazing restaurants. The price is definitely worth it. It has spoilt hotel life for me as nothing will ever live up to it. Child friendly. And very helpful staff. Lovely gifts and amazing extra activities!!!","5","2014-10"
"Afternoon Tea - expensive, but worth every Dirham!!","This is arguably an expensive treat, in fact, very expensive treat. If you spend this kind of money elsewhere in Dubai, you could have a really top quality meal with champagne and all the trimmings - so is it worth the money to have afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab?  Quite simply, the answer is a definite 'YES'.
This is one of the most iconic buildings in the world and often the first thing that people associate with Dubai.. To see it from outside is great, but to visit and experience the hospitality is another thing that must be done at least once...
For me, the quality of the food and absolutely fantastic service were the highlights. All the courses (there were several), were excellent and more importantly the staff's description and knowledge of their 'product' was superb. Visiting the actual hotel, was also an experience - but if you have been to some of the more exclusive hotels in Vegas then you have seen it all before (fountains, exotic fish tanks, mosaic floors, exclusive boutique shops and lots of 'bling bling').

Tips
------

- Book the 4pm sitting and arrive early. First come first served means that that you are more likely to get a window seat. (Everyone asks for a window seat, but not everyone gets one).
- The best seats are those to the right hand side of the restaurant with views of the coast line and Wave hotel. (We had widow seats, but just with views out to sea).
- Don't worry if you don't get window seats - you can still see out and the experience isn't really about the view, more the food and service.
- Yes, there is a dress code that needs adhering to, but when you arrive the experience is fairly 'chilled' - so nobody is eying you up and down to ensure that you are in latest designer gear! Some people turn up wearing a shirt and tie, others like myself a shirt and jeans.
- Don't worry about taking photos. When you arrive in the lobby, all your fellow 'afternoon tea crowd' will also be busy taking snaps, so you won't be alone.
- There is plenty of food and I was absolutely stuffed! I was worried that I might be hungry, especially as the courses are so small - but don't be shy in asking for more. I had 3 portions of all the sandwiches, but then couldn't finish all the scones. We didn't have lunch that day and definitely didn't need dinner later on.
- The whole experience lasts around 2 hours, although technically you are never asked to leave, the food just finishes and everyone else gets up and exits. I would recommend the gold leaf cappuccino as the finale (all included), but by this point you would have already eaten plenty of gold leaf, anyway..
-  Arrive with your booking confirmation written down, so when you get to the gate, security will let you and your taxi in. Best to get dropped off right at reception to avoid the potential sweaty walk over the bridge.
- On departure, walk back over the bridge as this is where you get the best photos of the building. (Grab a taxi at the water park just outside of nearby souk).
- Although not advertised, there is free Wi-Fi so you can tell all your friends on Facebook, where you are.. 
- FYI - the Sky bar (where afternoon tea is served) is around 200m above sea level, just one floor down from the helipad. 
- As this hotel has just featured on a very recent UK (Channel 4) documentary, I am guessing that this experience will become VERY popular - so BOOK EARLY to avoid disappointment.","5","2015-03"
"High Tea Treat","Was taken to the Burj Al Arab for High Tea as a Mothers Day Treat. Service excellent, surroundings opulent. Wine and Cocktails fabulous. Food superb. Lovely selection of breads.

"Good","Good one. I enjoyed my stay . Rooms are good and convenient. Hotel staff are nice and friendly . Food is good and atmosphere is cool and good to stay. I will visit again.  It isn't too bad . Food is good to taste and great variety","3",
"Afternoon tea","Went for afternoon tea on my birthday amazing !!! Had a seven course meal with champagne ! It is very expensive but as a treat of a life time well worth every penny . The service is fantastic and as it was my birthday they made me a birthday cake and delivered it in an amazing box , really can not fault anything ","5","2014-06"
"Extravagant Afternoon Tea","I booked the afternoon tea in the Skyview Lounge online before going to Dubai as it is very popular and must be booked in advance and is probably the cheapest way to visit this opulent hotel. Make sure you have printed off your confirmation email as you will need it to be allowed anywhere near.

I booked for 1pm as this is more than just an afternoon tea, it's a 7 course delight starting with a glass of champagne. The food and service is fantastic and you feel you are a valued guest and not just a tourist wanting the experience. If you arrive early it is no problem as you get to look around the lobby area and the rather wonderful shops.

Make sure you dress appropriately as your confirmation email will advise gentlemen should wear long trousers and a collared shirt and covered in shoes otherwise you will be refused admission so please respect their wishes.

A memorable 'must do' experience.","5","2015-03"
"Afternoon Tea - Love It!","Loved this place, took family there whilst visiting Dubai for afternoon Tea and it was superb! Great service, super food, stunning view, welcoming, friendly, great value for money - highly recommend!    Decor is a bit OTT but it all makes for the memories!","5","2015-03"
"What a stay!","It blew me away. I was apprehensive having booked to stay here with my mother as a treat. My expectations were huge along with the dent in my pocket but it was worth it.
From the arrival on the bridge, the cold towels and dates in the lobby and then finally seeing the room - it really was something. 
I booked the panoramic suite and it was worth the extra money - the floor to ceiling windows are quite breathtaking - in fact the whole room is breathtaking to be honest. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and were taken straight to our room which was great. The sweeping staircase is the first thing you really see in the room - imagine that - your own staircase - madness! I thought there would be far too much gold but actually I was pleasantly surprised that the room was actually very tastefully decorated - it just seems to fit with the hotel. 
Our suite was huge - the downstairs had a bar which was fully stocked and had a huge variety of glasses, an office with printer, Mac and huge desk and a living room/lounge with built in TV. The upstairs bedroom is also large with a beautiful bathroom complete with a huge shower and jacuzzi and large Hermes products to take home. The dressing area is also large with plenty of room to dance around in!
The staff are top notch - our main butler went above and beyond explaining every part of the room and hotel to us and answering all our questions. Nothing was a problem as you would expect. They are unobtrusive and very nice paying particular attention to what you do and do not like. We were there to celebrate a new start after a bad year - we were given a beautiful bouquet of flowers and canapes. A really lovely touch. 
Everything in the room can be controlled from an ipad type of device - from opening the door to turning on the TV - hilariously lazy.
The spa is worth noting - there is a separate part for women or a mixed pool. The view from the pool is simply stunning - even if you only have 5 minutes to spare dip your toes in for the views.
The pool area is small but faces out onto the open ocean which is lovely and is not at all crowded. Staff there are also top notch - as soon as I had finished the water more was brought in a cooler. Sweets, fruits and beverages were offered throughout the time we spent there and all were complimentary.  
As much as the hotel is crazy expensive when there the prices are not outrageous. The pool has a lovely restaurant where we enjoyed a buffet lunch (lobster,sashimi etc) and was pretty reasonably priced considering where you are and for the selection and quality of food.
The sky bar was also great for a drink - great views and funky drinks plus when youre staying you get a table right by the window.
Would I stay again - Yes. Absolutely.","5","2015-02"
"Ultimate Afternoon Tea - for sure!","A friend and I visited Burj Al Arab for High Tea. It was a seven course set tea, with champagne. The staff was very friendly, we felt very much welcomed. The food and drinks were definetively worth the visit. The experience is worth the price. The hotel is beautiful, and Sahn Eddar where we had tea had a great view towards the beautiful, turquoise beach.","5","2015-03"
"The best one I have ever stayed in","Me and my boyfriend decided to spend 1 night at the most luxurious hotel probably in the whole world. We were reviewing the pictures before we made the booking so I told myself why not, lets give it a try! Everything was so so perfect. Upon our arrival we were welcomed in the most sophisticated way by the staff. When I entered the room ( actually it was a two-floor apartment) I was left speechless. It wowed me in every possible way. The marble, the cleanliness, the actual décor, the view, design... We have enjoyed the facilities especially the bar on the rooftop and the Arabic breakfast the next morning and the beach.. I must say every single penny it was definitely worth it. I highly recommend it for everyone. I will definitely be back for a longer stay.","5","2015-02"
"The hotel is not worth this money","I went to Burj Al Arab in the beginning of March and was left with a huge disappointment. I've been to this hotel for several times and watched it getting worse and worse every year. The management staff is very slow in action, the quality of service has become terrible. We ordered chicken to our room one day and it was rotten inside! I am left with nothing but frustration and I can say for sure: the money this hotel asks for is absolutely uneven to the quality it can offer.","2","2015-03"
"Best hotel in the world, i will be back...!","I had mixed feelings about staying here, I was worried it would be too flash and that there would be too many tourists. I was wrong on every level, it was incredible, I was blown away by it. I stayed for 4 nights and only wish I had booked more! It’s somewhere everybody should experience at least once! 

Our Suite - We had a panoramic suite which was worth the extra money, the view from the 11th floor was mesmerising. The butlers were great and the additions such as the Hermes product sets (full size not travel size), welcome bottle of wine, evening drinks and snacks and gifts left by housekeeping (not just a chocolate on the pillow at the Burj!) make it feel like a home from home, and help justify the expensive room rate!

Food - We had breakfast included, on the first day we ate in the restaurant which was nice but chose to eat in our room the other mornings for no extra cost which I would advise given the service, and rooms are so good. We had dinner in our room one evening too which was equally good. I’d have done that every night if I could but my other half likes to go out! It was strange, usually in hotels I can’t relax but it really did feel like home, so luxurious! We had lunches by the pool and all the food was excellent and actually not too expensive. 

Pool/Beach – Both lovely. For us we prefer the pool area, particularly the grassed area. It was very quiet and sheltered from the wind (it was fairly windy in Dubai whilst we were there), service was excellent and all the FOC additions like snacks, bottled water in water coolers (topped up all day), ice lollies and sweets that the staff bring round are a welcome addition. 

Spa / Gym – I didn’t have a spa treatment as such, but I did have a foot massage by the pool which was amazing. The Spa facilities (pool, sauna, steam etc) were brilliant. The Spa pools (a mixed and a women’s only) are just beautiful and the staff so helpful. Everything you could want is catered for here. The gym was really good too, a great range of machines. 

It was my boyfriend’s second trip to the Burj and my first. I certainly hope it won’t be my last. My only concern is I have now been spoilt beyond belief and nothing else will ever quite compare! Yes its expensive, but the rooms, the service and the additional FOC touches provided make it all seem very much worth it.","5","2015-02"
"Burj Al Arab Jumeirah  - Mesmerizing for the eyes..","This is a luxury hotel located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.It is resembling the sail of a dhow, a type of Arabian vessel.

"Amazing - Exceeded our expectations!!","We stayed at the Burj  on a stopover to Europe. Exceeded all expectations in every way. Limousine pick up from the airport, tea & dates on arrival. A personal butler for your room - its not a room its a luxurious apartment. Ask for a late checkout to enjoy every minute of the stay. To top it off we were pleasantly surprised by our extravagant gifts on checkout. Must dine at one of the restaurants and have a massage as well - you feel you are in floating in the sky. A must for everybody to tick off their bucket list. Thank You Burj Al Arab !!! A stay we will never forget.","5","2014-07"

"Birthday treat of afternoon tea.","Like many other reviews our experience of a birthday afternoon tea was great.  We enjoyed the food, cakes tea, and of course champagne too.  Excellent service and to watch the sun set while eating and viewing from a window table was magic.
Sadly the toilets of the sky bar were a let down, nothing luxurious about them at all,they should take a look at Harrods toilets and follow suit, and the floor was swimming in water!!
Hotel is stunning, but like the rest of Dubai unreal................La La Land!!","5","2015-01"
"Afternoon tea in the sky!","This was a fabulous experience from entering the hotel to being zoomed up to the skybar in a glass lift.  We had a table at the window over looking Dubai, afternoon tea commenced at 4.00pm our attentive waiter poured us a glass of champagne and then one course after another was served to us each course was perfect.  The extensive tea menu meant we could try a variety of different tea's through out the meal all were delicious.

4.pm is a great time for afternoon tea as the sun sets whilst you are there this presented some great photo opportunities, although there were many photo opportunities through out our time at the Burj","5","2015-02"

"Once is enough","There are some many buses and tourist clogging the place it is like an amusement park. You can tell that the rooms have not been updated for a decade, most very thing a little faded and worn. While expensive,  they add on a service charge of 10%, then turn around and charge for every service! It reality, it is just a 10% increase in charge (you get nothing for it). It is site worth visiting once because it is the image that defines Dubai...but only once. ","4","2015-02"
"Afternoon tea with the Viator tour","We got there at 16.10 and had to leave by 5.00 sharp. Not enough time to enjoy the surrounding and the tea experience. Food itself was ok. I mean, well presented and stuff ( looovely the carved meat). But living in London UK, I had better if not equal afternoon teas. You cannot just walk in as its a very private hotel. So make a reservation in advance. The architecture is amazing so it's worth a visit just for that. ","4","2015-02"
"High Tea at Al Muntaha","Incredible food and service, amazing view. The piano really contributes to the classy atmosphere. Disappointed that I made the booking one month in advance and requested a table by the window, but wasn't told they are given on a first come, first served basis. So a tip for people planning this lovely afternoon - arrive early for the best tables.","4","2015-02"
"Don't waste your money","We visited from the UK for brunch at the Burj Al Arab. Afternoon tea is served in the Al Muntaha Restaurant on the 27th floor and the view is really good. However this cannot be said for the food. We stayed in the Grosvenor House hotel and the buffet there (which we got free) was far superior to the buffet at the Burj Al Arab. I have a bad dairy allergy and not one thing was labelled to tell me what contained dairy. I asked the members of staff and none of them knew either. So I had to basically try my luck. Well straight away after trying the food I wasn't well, I'd taken a bite of a pastry filled with cheese. This is an absolute joke that not one member of staff could tell me what I could or couldn't eat, especially after paying a ridiculous amount of money. The range of food wasn't too bad but there wasn't a great variety. The drinks are so overpriced. My father paid AED 85 for one bottle of beer (£15). The buffet cost us around AED 790 (£140) each which was not a representative price at all. Another problem is the dress code. It says that it is smart casual, men have to wear a collared shirt and full length trousers. My family and I all dressed very smartly however some of the people in the were dressed in sports shirts, football tops and shorts. It says this is not allowed so why say there is a dress code and not follow it? The only reason I gave this review 2* is because they went out of their way to make my Dad a birthday cake as it was his birthday when we visited, otherwise it would have been 1*. Apart from this, our experience here was a shambles and I wouldn't recommend wasting your money.","2","2015-02"
"It's for a reason most luxsurious hotel in the world!","We had a lunch in Al Muntaha,it's amazing restaurant on the 27 th floor (it was the only way to get inside without paying for a room). It's fish restaurant,pretty expensive. Hotel is really impressive,all is about breathtaking grandeur. Lobby with enormous gold pillars and dancing fountains. Even elevators are in gold and you have a beatiful view.","5","2014-05"
"Wish the rating had another star for this one","Well to be honest, we got lucky to visit the club suite and the entire hotel premises. The place is for royalty. The private lobbies, the personal touch, the uniformity in contructing the rooms and the entrances, the security systems are all a notch above the usual 5 star hotels. Words are less to mention the aura of the place and only a personal visit will do justice.","5","2015-01"
"Absolutely beautiful oasis!!!","One of the best hotels we have experienced. Thoughts are given to every detail I perfection. The rooms are huge! The bathrooms palatial, not to mention a perfect water view from any room! Restaurants range from efficient to very high end, with room service being punctual and decent for the pricing.
The concierge is very informed with the best of the best in the surrounding area, they know the details for any adventure you may wish to experience.
The underwater restaurant although pricey is not to be missed. The staff is is absolutely awesome, experienced, and caring to fulfill your immediate needs. 
The buffet was 100 dollars pp, but well worth it, the list of items is endless, from seafood, to meat, and exotics!!! The other hotels pale in comparison 
Must experience the water park as well","5","2015-01"
"save your pennies","this hotel is mind blowing, after watching sevral movies which features this hotel i had to check it out, the hype for this hotel is true , fantastic venue, beaches are great, staff are great, hotel rooms and views are bliss.","5","2014-07"
"Shame on Jumeirah Hotel Group","I had a buffet dinner in JUN resturant, it costs USD225 per person exclude soft drinks. The resturant is in GM floor, of course, there is no view. The food variety is few and the seafood is not fresh. I booked for 4 persons and I was requested to pre-pay the money when I made the reservation, in fact, 3 persons had buffet dinner, but the hotel refused to return the money for the one who didn't join the dinner. What a ridiculous international 5 star hotel. Shame on Jumeirah Hotel Group.","1","2015-02"
"I highly recommend this hotel","I highly recommend this hotel. The short stay we have experienced was wonderful; all staff without exception went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable. This place was amazing, rooms gorgeous and staff was great. We will definitely be back here next year. The hotel is well located and good ambience, well done. Overall experience is excellent. Breakfast was superior and room service members perfectly did their job. Room so large and comfortable feels like home welcoming. This is a very well built and maintained facility. Architecturally, the rooms are great, and the grounds are lovely. You shall certainly see us there again!","5","2015-02"
"Another fantastic stay!","we were very pleased with the hotel and delighted by the staff
If you are going to Dubai on vacations with your loved ones, then I must suggest to spend atleast 1 night and 2 days here. This is a fantastic property having its own well maintained beach, good location, Sea view from each room, one of the best waterwork. The rooms were luxurious , huge and when we walked in all we could all say was wow. The bathroom was huge also.
The hotel building itself, hotel grounds and our room were all immaculate. They are extremely well maintained and ALL staff we encountered on a daily basis were very polite and friendly.","5","2014-07"
"A great view from the top","We went to the Burj al Arab and ate in every restaurant there, the food was really good in each.  My best tip to any traveler is to simply eat at the top or grab a cocktail up there, this was our favourite part and by far the best experiment of the Burj. I wouldn't recommend The under the sea restaurant as this was hugely disappointing venue so not worth going in my humble opinion. Enjoy","3","2014-06"
"Truly Stunning","We stopped off in Dubai for a few days either side of travelling to Australia and since the trip was a long one, thought we would treat ourselves to a few nights here.  I have to say that it was costly, but certainly worth every pound.  The hotel does not fail to deliver in any way at all, the rooms were perfectly kept and maintained with excellent facilities which were amazing.  There is so much to do in the hotel that you could stay for days and not leave once!  The children were entertained and my partner too.  The food and restaurants were simply some of the best we have ever been too, I can't describe how good they were.  From the most basic of dishes to high end dining, everything was available and amazing.  If ever we were going this way again, we would stay - but for more than a few days!","5","2014-10"
"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious","We went with half a mind to sneer at the tacky excess, stopping over en route back from the Maldives. We were converts two steps in. There are lots of visitors in the lobby area but as we emerged from the revolving door we were greeted by name which still slightly freaks me out. We had a two bedroom suite that was palatial -  I would guess 200 or 300 square metres over two floors with the most comfortable beds I have ever experienced. Rather more gold than I would have in my own home but all part of the experience and yes, and they do have $10,000 gold plated ipads to browse the hotel info ! Service was the very best: often happening subtly without even having to ask. When it came to dining we ordered from the room service menu (with our own dining room and butler it seemed they way to go !) and was reasonably priced - certainly this trip  we have paid more for meals that have been nothing in comparison. The lobster and wagyu beef combo for two was memorable. When ordering ice cream for my daughter and being offered strawberry, chocolate or vanilla I asked if it would be at all possible to get one scoop each of of chocolate, coconut and caramel flavours. There was a nervous pause and they said they would get back to me. The phone rang five minutes later with confirmation it would be possible. I could just imagine one of their little electric golf buggy rushing off into the sandstorm that was raging outside.  Breakfast was fantastic (and they coped with logistics of the continuing sandstorm restricting the seating capacity as normally many people site outside). I am sure we will visit again.","5","2015-02"
"Wow","We had Friday brunch for my partners 50 th birthday. The whole experience was one to remember. It's not cheap but well worth the money for a very special occasion. The little touches like I went to put my handbag on the floor and our waiter brought a hook to the table that clipped to the table to hang your bag off. They brought a birthday cake  sprinkled with gold boxed for us to take away it was delicious at no extra cost and I left with a rose. The food was exceptional. The desserts were displayed beautifully and how any one could by pass them I don't know. So make sure you save room for them. There was a variety of food for everyone. The view was breath taking from the restuarant so remember your camera. Book in advance and search different sites for deals.","5","2014-05"
"If you can afford it, you have to check this place out","Came here for lunch at the Asian buffet.  Selection was really good, though paying ~$100pp for a buffet is a little insane, but then again we are in Dubai.  The coolest part was when pulling up to valet, every single car was a RR.  I felt like a nobody in my chauffeured S-Class lol.

Didn't get access to anywhere else, because that's only for guests, but I'm sure that it's really cool.","4","2014-11"
"The Ultimate Travel Destination","When I reserved my room nearly 10 months ago, I was prepared to receive services and accommodations over and beyond my usual venues (five stars). What I experienced was the ultimate in privacy, luxury and comfort, with a staff extremely well trained for everything I might need. Pity the subsequent hotels, as they will always pale in comparison. I will never regret the cost,as each nuance provided ever-increasing pleasure. The best in every respect.","5","2015-02"
"Waste of $$","Went there for high tea cox  thot we had to see the burj al arab while in dubai. Very very very dissapointed. Food was well below standard and for the crap they served def overpriced. We had better food at the basement of wafi mall ( connected to raffles hotel) at a fifth of what the burj was charging.","1","2014-11"
"A must see in Dubai!","We had a party of 7 and went to the Burj Al Arab for breakfast. All we could say was WOW! This place is over the top luxury. I admit the breakfast was a bit pricey but the total experience was worth it. Everything they fed us or gave us to drink was so tasty. even the Cappuccino had gold flakes. The scenery was breathtaking. It was around Valentine's Day so there were red roses put together in the shapes of hearts all over the place. The indoor water features are captivating also. If you go for your birthday, they give you a small personal cake with a candle and the band may play happy birthday to you!","5","2015-02"
"Perfect","This hotel is great I stayed here for a business week and it was excellent the Actual room was very spacious and I love that it was two stories I felt like i was in a small house the room was very clean greatly decorated and there was lots of great amenities like the iPad and the abundance of entertainment systems. The bed was large and comfortable. The pickup at the airport was very convient a also the drop off with the white Rolls-Royce the driver was friendly and very helpful. The checkin process was very smooth. They led us in to our room and the chekin took place there so there would be no crowd. Im surprised how the manage a large hotel such as this so efficiently. The Breakfast and dinner was very nice and the underwater restaurant was also very nice. There was a strict dress code of no shorts after 6 pm and men could not take of their jackets at dinner. The venue is stunning and has great architecture. Checkout was quick and easy and they drove us right back to our Jet at the fueling station instead of dropping us at the main airport gate which was a very nice little favor. Definitely will be staying at the Burj again.","5","2014-07"
"A lot of money, a lot of hotel","We booked the two night package where you get a two story suite, a rolls royce pick up and drop off at airport, free breakfast and dinner at the underwater restaurant and couples massage.  It was a lot of money but wanted to do it in life. The service is overwhelming, sometimes almost too much.  We are upper middle class, just not used to that.  I felt like an elderly person who gets tired of their kids helping them too much and wanted to say I can do it myself.  We placed our shirts onto a lounge chair, got into the pool and when we looked back staff had made up two lounge chairs with towels and placed a cooler full of water and drinks (all free) for us.  It was crazy to me, but I guess that's the Burj.  After a hectic trip from India I kept hoping check in process would be quick not realizing a line of people greet you at the door to welcome you and they immediately take you up to your suite and the check in is there.  They really have the process down.  I've never seen a large hotel able to treat you like it's just yours- even in the best big five star hotels you still feel like you are one of thousands.  Not so here- really felt the staff were all there to take care of just us.  The meals and breakfast were great.  Drinks didn't come with our free dinner and we had 3 cokes and a bottle of water- that was $50 USD.  Because of things like that I'm glad I booked the all-inclusive rate.  The building itself is stunning- the inside is even prettier than the outside.","5","2015-01"
"Amazing Experience!","The Burj is what is says it is. The world's most luxurious hotel...but at a cost. A beer is £7 and a glass of champage will set you back £30. Not for the faint hearted. However the rooms are spectacular with bells and whistles galore. The lobby is stylish and jawdropping, the Al Mahara is a great restaurant but again, is tough on the wallet (£300 for 2 with wine). The Hotel has a strict dress code (no shorts after 6pm) and gentlemen cannot remove their jackets at dinner - this can seem a little stiffling if you are there on a relaxing holiday.

The Burj is unique and worth staying a couple of nights just to savour the experience and the glamourous surroundings......Be sure to take the Rolls to the airport when you leave.","5","2015-01"
"Afternoon tea","We had afternoon tea there it was fantastic and the views were out of this world. Would definitely recommend a visit here to finish of your trip to Dubai. The lifts and escalator were mirrored with fish swimming in the walls. ","5","2014-03"
"The best of the best ","Burj al Arab -  the name needs no introduction. The best hotel in the world without a doubt. If you want to experience what royalty is,  burj al Arab is the venue. Even if the stay is for a mere one day,  you can't stop admiring the mere pleasure of staying at this magnificent venue. ","5",
"Everything and more","My husband and myself had looked forward to this experience for so long and we were not disappointed. The whole experience was everything we hoped for and more. It was the perfect ending to a perfect holiday.","5","2015-02"
"Magic!","If you want an experience out of the ordinary - treat yourself to a drink at the Sky View Bar at Burj Al Arab - it is a bit expensive but worth every dime!!! The view over Dubai is magnificent and just entering the hotel with it´s special interior and the most helpful staff is special - so just do it!","5","2015-02"
"definitely we should stay at burj al arab","Burj Al Arab is one of the best hotel in the world.best interior and gives high class facilities.it also provide free helicopter ride.stay at burj al arab makes you feel classy.if you want to go dubai you should definitely stay at burj khalifa and should book from trip advisor.","5","2014-12"
"Burj Al Arab Jumeirah","View and décor:
The hotel is one of the landmark and very luxuriously decorated with gold. Beautiful fountain synchronized with music.
The surrounding beach area have beautiful view.

Transportation:
However, it may be take a long time to get a taxi from the taxi stand outside of the hotel.
You should get the hotel to order a taxi for you to get out.

Shopping:
They do not have big shopping area.","4","2015-02"
"High tea a bit dissapointing.","We booked a tour which took us to the burj al arab high tea and then to burj khalifa through viator.
AIthough the hotel is very impressive ,the high tea and the service did not blow me away.Im sure we could have a better hospitality experience for a lesser price.
The seven courses could not be served to us because the service was slow and we had a tour manager waiting for us to take us to the next leg of our tour.we were there for a good two hours and time estimated for the high tea is only 90 minutes.so we rushed through our sorbet and the cakes were packed for us by an accomodating gentleman from the service staff.I would go only to take pictures.","3","2015-01"
"EXCELLENT","It was a wonderful experience.
Good Hospitality and Very good room Service.
The Service was very good.
I had a very good time staying in this hotel.
The environment was very pleasant and royal with good natural views from top.","4","2014-07"
"Sky bar","Celebrated my 50th Birthday and it is the most amazing place to eat and relax. The food was out of this world and the staff are excellent . It is breathtaking when you enter the hotel as there is elevators on each wall and the most amazing aquariums running down the side of them.","5","2015-02"
"Greatest hotel in the world!","I went for business and celebrating my anniversary with my wife.  The hotel is an amazing property but the service was second to none.  They had a few hiccups but made it up 10fold I felt like a king they went above and beyond.","5","2015-02"
"very average","I recently stayed here on a business trip. Really not all that! especially for the money you pay per night. Interior is over the top and I believe there is better hotels to stay in Dubai now. I wouldn't return again.","3","2015-01"
"Nice....but not all that!!","My family and I booked an evening in the sky view bar for drinks. After such an exciting build up about visiting such an exclusive hotel i was quite dissapointed. Upon walking into the reception i was expecting jaw dropping architecture but really there isnt much to look at. We were escorted to a lift at the rear of the building to take us up to the sky view bar. We were made to feel welcome and were shown to our table. Unfortunately it wasnt by a window so we didnt get the full effect of the breathtaking dubai skyline. There is a minimum spend of around 300 dirhams (about £60) each just to reserve a table. As the drinks are so expensive its easy to blow the bank balance. It was a pleasant evening and a memorable experience but not one i will be repeating simply because i just wasnt impressed by it. Think i was expecting much more.","3","2014-09"
"Is there something better than simply marvelous","This is my hotel of choice when staying Dubai. My 8th visit in fact and they just keep getting better and better. the city is growing still at a rapid pace and there is so much to do around the Burg Al Arab........ You're minutes from the gold Souks and the subway can have you in the financial district in 15 minutes","5","2015-02"
"Amazing luxurious landmark","Definitely, one of the best resorts in the World. Amazing architecture, incredible details, and very spacious rooms.  The restaurants are excellent, from the buffet of the Bab Al Yam, to the superb Al Mahara ""under water"", or the Al Muntaha with it's incredible view from one of the top floors.If you're not staying at the hotel, you can still dine there, but you will need to make reservations well in advance and only for the Bab Al Yam (buffet). The staff is excellent, very courteous and professional.","5","2014-05"
"A very special afternoon teat","Although a bit expensive it is a real experience.  As much to eat as you want.  As much tea/coffee/soft drink as you want and one glass of champagne. We watched the sun set over Dubai.  Ask for a window seat and get there early (starts as 4pm - get there about 3.15 and check in).","5","2015-01"
"Hotel of the highest quality and service","We could not have had a better experience for our first stay in Dubai.
The Sofitel on the Palm is absolutely first class with outstanding service and superb facilities. Its location is perfect and just short taxi rides to all Dubai's tourist attractions. The motor boat cruise from the hotel jetty is a must do.","5","2015-01"
"Afternoon Tea","This was my 50th birthday treat and what an amazing experience it was.  Living in Dubai as I do, you get used to seeing this beautiful building, but actually visiting it and experiencing all it has to offer, is something else.  The staff all made my birthday special, even baking me a special cake delivered with a red rose.  My parents had flown in for this event, and even though they have travelled all over the World, they also were impressed by all the Burj Al Arab had to offer.  If you are lucky enough to visit this fabulous hotel, you certainly won't be disappointed.  Worth every single penny and more.  The building is a true work of art and the SkyBar's views are spectacular.  We have some amazing photos from this memorable day.  Thank you to all involved in making this day fabulous....","5","2015-01"
"Currently staying in the burg","As this is supposed to be the leading hotel of the world all I can say is I prommise you we have stayed in nicer places. Last night we were in a resturant in the hotel and a little girl on the table next door went to the corner lifted her skirt and puddled on the floor then her young brother proceeded to pack up the things on the table ie condiments ect to take away.  One piece of advice do not have dinner in the pool side resturant as it resembles a cafe with people pushing and shoving and very poorly dressed not what I expect from this quality and price of hotel very disappointed","2","2015-01"
"Burj Al Arab on a budget!","Nearly 18 months ago but my visit to THE Burj is quite unforgettable.   Wanted to visit hotel. this is only permitted  as a guest or eventually a tourist group. 0n internet found that hotel serves an elegant  High Tea with views for around US140 prebooked. Once in a lifetime, why not?   Prepaid,  was given a code to quote on arrival.   Hired driver and car (very reasonable) at my hotel - arrived at the Burj, quoted my code, immediately was referred to  by name and waved through.  As I admired with intense curiosity the very impressive entrance and foyer was directed at my leisure to a special lift which whizzed me up to the 27th floor.  Felt like a celebrity!
Greeted by name by a lovely young hostess.  Offered a variety of tables and I chose one with a vew of Palm Island.   Hostess  quietly offered a magazine to me as I might like to browse while I waited..  How thoughtful!    Glass of french champagne arrived and then a miniature effigy of the Burj hotel in wrought metal with unbelievable titbits to taste and savour.  Worth every dollar it was something to remember  for a very long time.   Each delectable titbit was a work of art and tasted heavenly.   Layer upon layer to try and enjoy, more were offered however just had to decline, I was looked after with friendly courtesy  and felt very comfortable.  I enjoyed the view studied the many groups of people and thoroughly enjoyed the exquisite edible works of art which were a delight to admire but even better to taste!  I felt so special.  Finally  wanted to see browse a little  with the freedon of a guest.  Caught the lift to a lower floor visiting the many restaurants,   The architecture is amazing and I marveloled when looking up to higher floors is just wondrous.  Finally,  I exited and my driver was there to pick me up and take me to my hotel which was great but not the Burj!   My day had ended but the memory lingered on","5","2014-03"
"Close to perfection","I felt something was missing upon our third visit, staff was brilliant, service excellent but no consistency. You don't get the respect expected for a returner. Everything is beautiful, we'll marinated and food selection is outrageously wonderful.","5","2014-06"
"Amazing doesn't come close","I was lucky enough to come here for my 40th birthday and wow - what an experience!!

I cannot say how incredibly beautiful and classy this place is and the staff cannot do enough for you. 

The Burj was on my bucket list and it didn't let me down at all.","5","2014-09"
"Truly magical!! Phenomenal hotel & staff!!","Well where do I start, me and my hubby love Dubai. We usually stay at the Jumeriah beach hotel and have done for the past 8 years, my hubby knew how much I wanted to stay at the Burj Al Arab. So he surprised me for our anniversary!! From the moment we got picked up in the Rolls Royce it was magical. 
The welcome was straight forward they knew who we were when we arrived no hanging about. I know that's what you'd expect for what you pay but it's brilliant got taken up to our suite on the 19th floor and woooowwwwww what a suite!! Totally amazing, 2 floor suites, the views the bed bathroom, pillow choices., goodnight gifts etc. Our butler was fantastic a button call away. They did everything for us, nothing was too much trouble. We were half board so our butler took us around to all the restaurants and what the options were. 
We ate at the Jun Sui restaurant which was great. The chef was fabulous and although it's a buffet restaurant, if you ask them for anything they would make it for you and bring it over. Fabulous staff there and the food is fabulous!! 
We also ate at Al Iwan Restaurant which again was amazing tasty fresh amazing Arabic cuisine, staff again fabulous. Breakfast in the room at no extra charge is a must, we got exactly what we requested and more!! Was delicious.
The pool is lovely they make sure you have cold water in you individual cool boxes. The private beach is a buggy ride away but me and the hubby had the whole beach to ourselves with the fab view of the Burj. The Tallise spa is also  amazing the couples massage was fab. The pool views are sensational. What a feeling!! 
Truly truly phenomenal and a experience I can tick off my bucket list. Worth the hype and worth every penny!! Our travel agent didn't advise us that our next hotel part of the Jumeriah group was fully booked. Our agent arranged another hotel for us the One & Only Royal Mirage. The operations manager was fantastic. She even arranged us to get chaffeur driven there. 
Can't stress how fabulous this was. we were there 2 nights 3 days but felt like longer because there's no point leaving as there's soo much to do. 
Definitely honeymooners and anniversaries couples to go!! 
A truly unforgettable 16th wedding anniversary I'll never forget!! 
Thank you all!","5","2014-09"
"The best","I prefer to everyone to at least try this hotel for once. its one of the 7 wonder thing in the world and its really romantic and lovely. you can go there also with families. but for sure you should try it at least one time.","5","2014-03"
"The 7*","Yes it is the premium hotel, that everyone wishes to experience. The Pride, the prestige everything comes along with the name- Burj al Arab.everything is just fine from the staff to the hotel ceiling. Th location is just perfect.
Although my experience in the dining was not extraordinary, as i expected it to be. But other than that my short visit was a memorable experience.","4","2014-12"
"Didn't meet expectations - all glitz and no substance","Ok, so it's taken me nearly three months to calm down enough to write this review!
Billed as the most luxurious hotel in the world, our expectations were through the roof before we'd even finished booking our holiday to celebrate my birthday in Dubai! 

Our favourite hotel chain is Mandarin Oriental, and we have stayed at a few of their hotels on our travels and consider them to provide the very best hotel service in the world. So I was looking forward to see how the Burj Al Arab could improve on the Mandarin Oriental experience.

Now we're not particularly wealthy and this was a real treat for us and the kind of money we spent on a 5 day holiday in Dubai is the kind of money we would have spent on a 10 day holiday in Asia. Our expectations were high for a relaxing holiday (and birthday!).
We arranged for their Rolls Royce to collect us from the airport and it was a perfect start to the holiday. On arrival at the hotel, there was a bit of a panic on, (we'd booked a double room) yet the hotel had allocated us a twin room. Now when you are paying £1500 a night, you expect what you booked! So we insisted on a double room when we arrived which they accommodated.
The suite was amazing - huge, over two floors, fantastic view, well equipped and bigger than our apartment in London! Exactly what we were expecting. The rest of the hotel was equally as impressive - it took us most of our first day to explore the facilities! (Although ?guided tour by the private butler would have been nice).
So the bits that ruined the holiday and the experience?
Firstly, we hired a private driver rather than use the hotel cars to take us to the various places we wanted to see in Dubai. I understand why the security arrangements are in place to get across the bridge to the hotel, but quite frankly the security staff were rude, disrespectful and unfriendly.
Secondly, we booked an evening meal in one of the hotels restaurants for the evening of my birthday. We started the evening in the cocktail bar - which is amazing, with great service, great staff and great views of Dubai. As a resident of the hotel we had a prime window seat reserved for us - perfect, just as we would have expected. 
We then went down to the restaurant, the Al Mahara. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy, and we had a great table right next to the aquarium. The view and atmosphere were amazing! We opted for the £400 a head 7 course taster menu with wine - it was a special occasion! We got to course 3 - the food was absolutely stunning, as we expected. Unfortunately the waitress managed to drop the used cutlery over my partner as she cleared the table! Now I guess these things happen - but she was more concerned with the napkin than my partners shirt and jacket! An hour later, we were still waiting for course 4 so left (it was 11pm and we'd been seated since 19.30!). I think there was another table seated in the restaurant who were proving challenging so the managers and waiting staff spent most of the evening trying to keep them happy and ignored us! So, at 11.30 we were in the room, hungry and rather stunned by the experience! To make matters worse, when we checked out a few days later, they had charged us for the dry cleaning for the shirt and jacket!! 
So, overall for what we paid and what we expected this was a very disappointing experience. Would I stay here again? Absolutely not. 

I understand that Mandarin Oriental are building a hotel in Dubai - so we will probably return to Dubai and stay there - now that's real service! And even having stayed at the seven star Burj Al Arab, would choose Mandarin Oriental every time to spend my hard earned cash on my hard earned holiday!","3","2014-11"
"You won't want to leave","this place thinks of everything, Rolls Royce transfer on our arrival. However when we did arrive our room wasn't ready due to our early flight, not to worry they let us rest and wash up in the presidential suit, Incredible. Our room was excellent as we expected they really think of everything. I don't want to give too much away, but the little extras that they offer put the cherry on top of the icing!","5","2015-01"
"glamour","we booked this hotel for one week,it was a dream.room very confortable with a super bath,very big and clean.staff was very professional and supportive.restaurants inside are fantastic with the best cookers of the world.you can choose a different kind of food and have a good view in front of the sea.location was excellent,from every side of the hotel you can have a fantastic view.it was my dream!!i hope to come back.","5","2014-04"
"Exceptional iconic hotel","My wife and I stayed at the hotel for the second time in Feb 2014 for 5 nights.

The service is exceptional, they can't do enough for you.  Everything is efficient, great food, nice pool, easy to get to, nice Hermes products in the bathrooms, etc...

It is expensive but for a treat so definitely recommend this hotel.

If I have one comment, I'd like to see the rooms upgraded a bit.  Certainly nothing new was there since we last visited the hotel 8 years prior.","5","2014-02"
"Excellent","The Burj al Arab is a phenomenal property, managed with the highest possible standards, and responsive and committed staff. The hotel is expensive, but this is to be expected at any property labeled as ""The most luxurious hotel in the world.""","5","2014-03"
"Awesome hotel, stunning features and views.","On arrival , We noticed a woman wearing a pink jacket stepping into a matching pink..... Ferrari. Inside, escalators on both sides of the room leading to the upper floor had massive fish tanks on their outer side, filled with beautiful multi coloured fish. Between the escalator was very creative water features. We paid around £70 for ""High Tea"" 7 courses starting with Champagne, leading to various choices of savouries to pastries  etc, with intervals in-between ending with an exotic tea. overlooking some incredible views.Lasted around just over an hour.  I was totally blown away with the whole experience. I would go back every year if I could afford too.","5","2014-02"
"We enjoyed it so much- we changed the rest of our trip!","We stayed at the Burj for the second part of our honeymoon in Dubai. We came from one night in Anantara in Dubai, and were due to check out and stay at the Atlantis for another night- except, we never made it to Atlantis.

The whole experience at the Burj makes you feel like you are royalty. This is from the welcome, where you do not touch your bags from the car, to meeting your butler/concierge to being shown around your own suite. Each room in the Burj is a suite, and we were staying in the panoramic view suite on the 8th floor. It was nothing short of extraordinary. Floor to ceiling windows overseeing the city, sea and you can see the palm. I had no idea what luxury was until staying here. Your own office, 3 bathrooms, a bar, a dining room, 2 living rooms, walk in wardrobes everywhere, a bedroom with mirrored ceiling. It was opulence, class and quality 
exuding from every corner. And the concierges would be there to wait on you hand and foot.

When we ordered lunch, we had it set up for us in our dining room with new cutlery, finger bowls and roses. 
Our mind was blown! And we couldn't imagine leaving. So eventhough it was another £1,000 to stay another night- we knew it would be worth it. Imagine that, WE KNEW A £1,000 a night was well worth it. And that says it all really. 

The spa is lovely, with the swimming pool overlooking the skyline of Dubai. My only complaint was not being able to get to the bar for afternoon tea, eventhough I was a guest. Even just for a look at the view. Otherwise, it is no wonder this is a 7 star hotel. I cannot wait to return with all of my family and indulge them in the opulence of the Burj!","5","2014-08"
"From someone who actually stayed there","TripAdvisor just came out with its list of top 25 hotels in the world, so I decided to check out the reviews of the Burj Al Arab (my personal favorite).  I was surprised that it didn't make the list and that the vast majority of the reviews on here seem to be from people who had only dined there or had high tea or looked at the building from the outside.  How can you know how good a hotel is as a hotel unless you actually check in?

We stayed at the hotel for a week around New Year's Eve a few years back and it was absolutely unforgettable.  We had a basic room (I believe) which at the Burj was a multi-floor suite complete with a master bedroom with a window looking over the ocean that was itself larger than many NY apartments.  We had our own concierge and butler (as does every guest) who went above and beyond to make our experience flawless.  My wife had her birthday while staying there.  They brought us a cake in our room.  They then brought a five piece orchestra to our room to play happy birthday.  They then brought us another cake that night at the restaurant.  I had to eventually tell them we were at risk of contracting diabetes to make them stop.

And New Year's Eve itself?  Oh my.  From the 30 ""flappers"" who lined up to greet the guests for dinner, to the 30 foot bar carved entirely of ice, to the 9 different types of caviar, to the barges that surround the hotel and shot fireworks it was simply beyond belief.  And the people watching was also amazing.  My son (who was 10 at the time) still says that you haven't lived until you've partied with Bulgarian oligarchs at the Burj for New Years.

Is it expensive?  Yea gods yes, but worth every penny.  From the building to the service no hotel in the world compares.  The Burj al Arab leaves them all in the dust.","5","2015-01"
"Fantastic place","This seven star hotel is a star attraction in Dubai with its unique structure and opulence. To visit, one must book one of the restaurants of this hotel.
We booked ""High Tea"" slot at nearly $140 per head. It was a relaxed seven course session that lasted over an hour plus. Gourmet items champaign to savouries to exotic pastries followed with small interewels finally ending with exotic tea.
Meantime, we were amazed by the grand interiors adorned with the best possible material available. Since it was Christmas time, the central portion was uniquely decorated with Chris trees, nutcrackers and flowery decorations. Going around the place was a real enjoyable experience.
This is the only way to visit and see the grand hotel otherwise, one must have deep pockets to stay there even for a night.","5","2014-12"
"Elegant, gorgeous, delicious, exquisite","OK, let's start by saying that afternoon tea at Burj al Arab is expensive. Normally, you might not pay so much for finger sandwiches. But you are paying for the entire experience, and that is well worth the money. The building itself is incredible...photo op after photo op, everywhere you look. (Especially check out the fountain at the top of the escalator!) The ride up in the elevator is exciting. The staff--top notch. They prepared a gluten free tea for me, and would  accommodate any request you have regarding food, I'm sure. The views (assuming you are there in the daytime) are beautiful. I completely loved my experience there and would go back and do it all over again.","5","2015-01"
"Posh Afternoon Tea","My husband and I had been to the Burj before but not for high tea and we were on holiday with another couple that had never been to Duabi, so we thought this would be a real treat for both couples. When I booked the reservation I asked if it was possible for a window seat, they replied by saying they would try to accommodate, and to our delight we got one. On arrival you had to show your letter of conformation to the security guard to enter the hotel, the hotel lobby is a WOW factor. The lift going up to the skybar on the 27th floor is a glass one facing the sea with views across the Palm.The high tea was started with a glass of bubbly then followed a berry tart, then a small plate of the chefs carvery of the day and both were delicious followed by the quirky tier cake stand that are in the shape of the Burj filled with sandwiches then another cake stand with scones and cakes finally sorbet to finish.The tea menu was extensive (never knew there was so many different types) at the end of the tea the ladies got a beautiful box of chocolates. The sun began to set which was beautiful and we all managed to get lots of photos and after the tea we had a cocktail at the bar which was devine. I would say its a must for the first time in Dubai,it is expensive but well worth it. If you have a birthday or anniversary please let them know when you book you will received an extra surprise.","5","2014-11"
"awesome","was the best high tea i ever had. the staff was soo nice and they really did their best in ensuring you to be comfortable and well served. the ambience is very soothing and warm welcoming. i must say the interior design was superb.i really enjoyed myself and would deffinately come back for another visit. thank you staff.","5","2015-01"
"A place to visit in Dubai, but just that","Being in Dubai, you must visit the Burj Al Arab. While the service was great and the food was great, it didn't shine as a place to stay longer. Go there for the tea menu, it is really good, but do not spend more than a couple of hours.","4","2015-01"
"Absolutely Outstanding","We visited the Sky Bar at Burj Al Arab and found the whole experience truly delightful.  The staff were exceptionally professional and polite but also friendly and more than willing to take photos of guests with the very unique view behind them.  They were also very knowledgeable about the menu and the various dishes on offer.  The food was delicious, beautifully presented and plentiful.  We were also given a sample box each to take with us at the end of the tea.  This is an expensive exercise but definitely worthwhile and I would highly recommend it.  TIP - arrive a little earlier to ensure a window seat as it is first come, first served!","5","2015-01"
"Unique Experience","I stayed for 2 nights in August 2014 and found the experience awesome. A lot of formality to enter hotel but once there the service is excellent - welcome drink (juice) cold towels very refreshing.The attention to detail is exceptional -  when checking in they also confirm you flights,seating,transfers etc.for your departure. You are escorted by a hostess to your suite introduced to your personal butler and the conseige for your floor. The hostess then explains the suite functions. The views from every angle - outstanding! All suites are two levels living rooms downstairs bedrooms upstairs - didn,t care for the mirror on ceiling above bed in bedroom).The decor is a little dated (versace 1990's) but beautiful and well maintained nevertheless. The restaurants are great and spa services bliss! A once in a lifetime experience if you can manage.I would certainly return again.","5","2014-08"
"A Lovely Dinner at JunSui Restaurant","We had a lovely dinner at JunSui restaurant. They have varied food from China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, etc; original and special taste. The entire environment in the restaurant was very comfortable.  Of course, the most amazing is the staff who work there; One Chinese waiter from YunNan province who was in our area, he was with very good attitude, smile at all times; I hope he will have more opportunity to help more guest after he develop & grow in the hospitality industry; Assistant F&B Manager Tracy & Kathine were very helpful; I wish them to have very good future for their career & family. Thanks to all of them! All the best!","5","2015-01"
"Too many restrictions","We booked afternoon tea in the sky bar to spend our final evening after a 4 week holiday touring India and Dubai. We arrived at a allocated time and arrival there was smooth and very welcoming. The building is amazing. When we got the lift(alone) to the restaurant we saw lovely views of the palm but this was where our views ended. Our seat was not by the window so our view was very disrupted. We requested to go to the adjoining restaurant which was setting up for evening service(no diners) to take a photo, told no. When window seats became vacant we asked to move, told no. When they gave one small box of chocolates between us at the end of the meal we were told it was one per couple. At the end of tea they couldn't get rid of us quick enough and the guests were all squashed into the lift to exit to allow for the next cocktail sitting to commence.
The decor in sky bar is a little tired and in need of updating. However the music played and the table service was excellent.
It was a very expensive experience but something you'll only do once perhaps. 
Its possible that when expectations are so high, disappointment is likely.
It felt like you get what you pay for and there is a large divide between hotel residents and hotel visitors. This made the experience a little less pleasant for me.
","3","2015-01"
"WOW. ONE OF A KIND","I was fortunate to have spent two nights at this incredible property. Even though I arrived at 3 am, I was greeted by the lovely ladies with cool washcloths, cool drinks. When I was brought to my suite, it was just amazing. Two levels of total luxury on the 21st floor. The breakfast was very extensive, set by the pool. I was surprised to see a woman in a fishnet wrap (why bother!) over a thong bathing suit, in a muslim country. Besides that, everything was absolutely as over the top as one can get!!","5","2014-11"
"Superb service","A group of us visited plus baby for lunch at the restaurant next to the sky bar. Children are not allowed in the bar and only allowed in the restaurants at lunch. The view was great and much better in the daylight so the palm can be seen. We were sat at that end of the restaurant which did get warm with the sun streaming in. Service was some of the best ever experienced. Slightly more formal than I would necessarily choose but very pleasant and the catered for the baby admirably. The food was lovely although the apple tart dessert had a soggy base. The wagu rib eye was for two but could have fed four and was prepared at the table. Huge variety of bread. Delicious scallops. We were treated to a tour where we saw the majesty of the hotel duplex rooms. Better presented rooms I have never seen. We also saw the 'underwater' restaurant which would be lovely for a romantic dinner. ","5","2015-01"
"Excellent","Went to have afternoon tea at one of the restaurants on the first floor. Was a little expensive but was more for the experience then the money. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was amazing. Definitely would recommend even if it just to see the inside of the Burj al Arab. ","5","2014-05"
"The afternoon tea was a pleasant experience.","Got value for money from the experience.Will definitely go again.Variety of assorted snacks&chocolate got us filled up&we couldn't eat dinner that day.My birthday notice that i mentioned on my reservation was not forgotten and i was given a birthday cake to celebrate.In all,it was a worthwhile experience.Thank you Burj Arab!","5","2015-01"
"sttange feelings","we tried to book there but price is outrageous...beyond what one would resonably pay. then tried to go for drinks to the skyview bar. Long waiting list of 10 days...then went to the bar of the asian restaurant...where we get a table at 730pm, very early...as the other times were fully booked. Arrived there and there was nobody. the managment said people book and do not come...and then replied that may be the same happens with sky view...that the long waiting list is indeed fake...they were so upset that they got us seats in the sky view which was not full of course....not really worth anyway as seing ligths in desert is not exciting...and cant even see the palm or even Iran....","4","2014-12"
"A Lifetime experience","A little hard to access the hotel if your credit card fails you. Luxury at its best. From the splendid view of the hotel to the eye-pleasing view of the sea, everything here is definitely a lifetime experience.","5","2014-05"
"my 2nd time and still loving it","I hate to bother to review the dozen of average hotels and restaurants during our travels, but it is my please to sit down and review my favorite ones. My wish is to end up having more wonderful places I love than those I dislaked or even hated.
For dubai this is the only hotel we stay because of excellent rooms, service and top restaurant. I never bothered to look at other hotels even from the same family, simply because once I like somethiing Ilike to stick to it like glue.","5","2014-03"
"All hype and odd decor","I was really looking forward to our visit at Burj Al Arab after all of the attention and press the property receives. But it simply failed on all levels to measure up to some of the world's best. Though the exterior architecture is special, every thing else was just average- the service, the food- and the decor is very strange. Black marble everywhere is too heavy for a beach front property. The fountain is not grand but has dinky water spouts and there is every shade of the rainbow within the hotel. There are no complementing colors- just a mishmash of everything with excessive gold, which, ironically, ends up looking cheap.","3","2014-02"
"An absolutely amazing experience!","Me and my little family, had an beautiful afternoon tea time. Everything was perfect..everybody in the staff, the 7course menue, the champagne, the live music in the background, the colourful environment,and so on. ","5","2014-12"
"Sensational","Great place to stay, plenty of entertainment in and nearby the hotel. Has one of the best brunches anywhere on this planet, if you like top grade caviar and crab then a must do. If you have the money then stay here.","5","2014-03"
"26th Anniversary","Amazing Trip.
Made us feel like King and Queen'
Service was 7* 
Whatever you wanted they would provide''
Finshed of with the Helicopter ride back to the Dubi Int Airport.
What a trip.

Yes its alot of money ''Hey you only live once ''","5","2014-12"
"Excellent hotel","Been here a few times now, first time leaving a review, amazing hotel, still leaves me in awe, staff is amazing and the kids love it here too. It puts a 5 star on the whole Dubai experience. Can't wait to come back. Thanks to all the staff. Will be back very soon.","5","2014-12"
"BRILLIANT STAY","This was not our first time at the Burj but was definitely our most enjoyable and hope to return soon.

The suites are amazing and we were so looked after..nothing is too much trouble...although expensive it was definitely worth the extra money . We were very lazy here and spent a lot of time  around the pool ...although not huge it is large enough and great atmosphere

Great breakfasts each day and wonderful meal as always at AL MAHARA

Our butler was excellent and lovely chap

We will be back...never disappoints","5","2014-07"
"Photos only ... from a distance ","We visited here on our last day. Hopeful to get a drink or lunch or experience the hotel but it was not to be. 

If you are interested to see this you need to know that unless you book a restaurant (in advance) you can only stand outside with a raft of taxis for a quick pic. Be organised! ","4","2015-01"
"Remaining fabulous!!","This was our second visit to this iconic hotel. Still has the 'wow' factor although perhaps a little less than the first time we visited in 2011. Stayed for 4 nights as a prequel to picking up a cruise ship for a month out of Dubai through the Indian Ocean. Most things were as we remembered them although a few things had changed for the negative. For example on our first visit every evening around 5pm the Butlers served canapés and a cocktail of your choice in your suite, this time we got the canapés, no cocktails! As a guest you still have to reserve a table to get a cocktail in the 'Sky' bar, I have never stayed in a hotel and had to book a time to have a drink! On our last visit you had the same Butlers pretty much throughout your stay, this time they changed daily, not enabling you to build a rapoire with any of them! However, the negatives were minor and we still had a fab time in arguably the best hotel in the middle east!","4","2014-11"
"beyond expectation","even if we already knew our location to celebrate Christmas lunch, we could not imagine that it had been so amazing
since first time in main entrance, untill our departure all staff were friendly and helpful, smiling and hospitable
menu on Al Muntaha restaurant was simply delicious: a variety of dishes by the best international culinary tradition; fresh fish, selected meats, fine sauces and a parade of superfine sweetness
wine list included selection of best bottles in the world
flawless waiters, live music and a breathtaking view to complete the atmosphere
I would like to relive this dream","5","2014-12"
"Amazing East of Dubai","Unforgettable time to spend of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Fujairah tours with GalaxyTourism. Great value of explore contrasting feature of Dubai desert with traditional Arabic lifestyle to modern contemporary activities. Get yourself ready to explore the majestic and luxuries city of Dubai, and its adjoining emirate of Abu Dhabi.","5","2014-12"
"Overall a very special hotel","I always wanted to visit this hotel to see if it lived up to the expectation as I had imagined and I was pleasantly surprised. The decor was incredible and I was in awe of the effort and detail that had gone into the hotel. The service levels were slightly inconsistent but overall were great. ","5","2014-01"
"Vegas in Dubai","Though I have never been to Vegas... I imagine that the burj is everything that a hotel in Las Vegas would be. Big, bold, and over the top.

While the view of the ocean is quite amazing, as is the interior space, the chosen styling was just a little too much for me.

There is a fountain in the lobby which I could have watched for hours though... Truly a marvel of engineering. 

","3","2014-02"
"A welcome return and truly superb experience","After a last minute change of plans, we were kindly accommodated by the hotel. This has been our tenth visit to the hotel and after a rough period during the credit crisis it has returned to it’s full splendour.

The rooms as always are immaculate and perfectly maintained and the cleaning team attentive and thoughtful.

It was my wifes birthday and very thoughtfully they had noted the wish for a discrete day but had also recalled her love of sunflowers.

The butler team were kind and attentive and my only regret being that I did not have the time to say thank you.

We dined at many of the restaurants and Bab al Yam for breakfast, the latter being warm and attentive, with a good range of food and superb service. We would note that for the egg cooking station does need training as the ‘chef’ can only take one order at a time and cook one egg at a time. Otherwise perfect.

The Spa as always was superb and it was excellent that there are fewer photo / tourist visitors but a shame the Al Aswan library still struggles with food and drink service.

Room service was excellent and the food much improved.

The hotel was superb, the team much improved and we are very grateful to everyone for their kindness and attention. We shall certainly be back.","5","2014-12"
"What a delight !!!!!","Afternoon tea at the Burj is a must thing to do for anyone. A sheer delight and I cannot praise the staff enough. Sheer opulence at £100 each for the fine selection of cuisine and a glass of champers. Make sure you add it to your list for the future.....","5","2014-12"
"It deserves 8 stars","My fiancee and I lodged here for 6 days while in Dubai. We had done research prior, and had extremely high expectations, which were met to say the least. We had the entry level room, which was very spacious around 1800 square feet. I would suggest this room unless you have kids, or want to treat yourself and live  like the Sheikh. The room service was top notch and what you would expect. The hotel itself and the grounds are immaculate, and finally the service was better than any service I have received anywhere that I have traveled to thus far. This hotel went above and beyond anything I could have hoped for, If I return to Dubai in the future, I am definitely going to be returning to this hotel that sets  the bar for the others to follow.","5",
"Not worth the hype !","Clearly a magnificent building to step into and be a part of history ! Amazing place and very different to what ever one has experienced before. Check in is in the room, which is nice, complimentary cheese and wine, Hermes soaps etc, nice bed , jacuzzi bathtub all lovely and no complaints at all !so rooms great. 
Out of the rooms all restaurants are buffet !! As in all and priced at AED 500 ! Good selection for such a price is terrible and can do better in a 5 star hotel in China. Underwater restaurant is a total scam ! Check sticker price ! You are inside an Aquarium ,not underwater ! 
Poolside breakfast has a great view of the ocean but again selection poor, so diss appointing. Service consistent  but surely and snobbish.  Remember your room number or they ignore you.
Spa service good and consistent but nothing that makes you go Wow !
Then on check out , argh the bill blows your head off !
Tread with care ! Not all it's cracked up to be","3","2014-12"
"Top quality","Went here for afternoon tea as part of excursion the place is absoloutly stunning marble and gold laced throughout and lovely calm atmosphere, all very well run and organised they truly do mKe you feel like a princess inside. We had little finger sandwiches Moët et Chandon sorbets and fillet of beef Wellington which melted in the mouth, still think about it now. To die for, very expensive but definatly wor the experience of being royalty for the day!","5","2014-06"
"Afternoon tea at the Sky Bar: Once in a lifetime experience with great service, beautiful view","Having afternoon tea at the Sky Bar in the Burj Al Arab is highly recommended. Service is of very good quality and with a personal touch. Make early reservations ( we did it a month in advance) so that you have window seats with splendid views. We reserved for the latest time option so that we could see the skyline in daytime, during sunset and by night. Champagne , food and drinks are all of very good quality. We were offered plenty of extra food. You can drink tea and coffee as much as you want.","5","2014-12"
"Fabulous anniversary stay!","This is the most amazing hotel room I have ever stayed in. You get a tour of the room because there is so much they need to show you.  They gave us flowers and cake for our anniversary. They go above and beyond - the service was amazing.  It's a once in a lifetime stay! The pools upstairs are amazing!","5","2014-08"
"Spectacular Hotel Treated Like A STAR","This is a spectacular 5 star hotel if it was out of 7 i would have given it 7 evrything u need is at the hotel evrything is kept prim and proper. I was treated as if i was an actor or some kind of role model","5","2014-05"
"Family friendly","We had such a wonderful stay at this hotel. To sum up, this hotel has everything what family is looking for on a holiday: 

- Family friendly
- Amazing staff
- Delicious food
- Bespoke service
- Airport pick up and visa assistance

In particular, we loved the spa area which has a  special zone for ladies where you can enjoy some afternoon tea, swedish massage is worth trying (best!),  they serve a fresh squeezed beetroot juice right after you leave the steam (complimentary), which is a nice touch. We would definitely come back. The best place to stay in Dubai. 

P. S. It's a bit annoying that there are too many tourists coming over to take pictures, but they are mainly at the lobby area, so it is okay.","5","2014-09"
"Out of this world","My friend and i stayed here for a short break. All i can say it was heavan on earth amazing faultless. The most wonderful staff food out of this world. It was a faultless break we are going back in january and march and may soo soo good. Highly reccomend to everyone superb xx","5","2014-12"
"Amazing treated like a super star","I went there it was absolutely brilliant holiday the rooms are fab u don't have to get up there's a remote control for curtains to open and close butler right outside your room and he will come quick good for kids every night at six a clock a man comes round with a little train and is filled with sweets and milkshakes and pop corn for kids I Mac in the room and you get to borrow a 24 Karrot gold I pad ask for one! Breakfast is nice buffet and meals at night is nice but the Indian was quite poor chinise was lovely very good safety loads of life gaurds around the pools for little kids","5","2014-01"
"Good buffet / Exaggerating entering conditions","While in Dubai we spontaneously decided one day to have diner at its most famous hotel in order to see it. You know, besides the mall, the bourj kalifa and the desert there is nothing more to do ... really ... in this brand new and dusty city.

Diner was excellent. Staff very professional and kind. Hotel is luxurious but impersonal. Very bling bling and charmless. 

Avoid to show up as you won't be able to go through the gates unless you have a reservation. They love to make you feel like you do not deserve to get in. It's too much.","4","2014-01"
"Incredible afternoon tea","We got a hint to visit this hotel prior flying to Dubai. Easy to prebook a table for two for the afternoon tea. The 16:30 sitting provides you access to the hotel and the 27floor sky bar with the beautiful view during the sun set time. Wonderful service from the gate, reception, and by everyone at the Skybar. Best afternoon tea so far! Highly recommended. Reserve some three hours for the full experience.","5","2014-12"
"Amazing as always","Went there with my wife again , you would expect to lose the Wao effect after visiting this property couple of times , but no !! This is not the case with this property . Service is amazing , rooms are fantastic and last but not least you can never get enough from this place . Well done Jumerah for this fantastic experience .","5","2014-12"
"Pure magic","From the first second it was pure magic. I loved the  gym and pool on the 18th floor - great view from the sauna, pure relaxation. Club sandwich at the pool side was amazing, sunset shisha at Bab al Yam priceless, the burj beach very nice and calm, the staff was quicker than my thoughts - I´ll be back ...","5","2014-11"
"Ultimate Afternoon Tea","We booked the Ultimate Afternoon tea, although a little pricey it was well worth the experience.
The food was all very high quality and very delicious too. The staff were very attentive and accommodating. The place is absolutely amazing and definitely worth a visit if you go to Dubai.
Had the best afternoon tea here and a wonderful experience.","5","2014-11"
"A wonderful experience","Visited this top class hotel on 3 occasions, twice for afternoon tea and once for cocktails. The first time I went was for afternoon tea to celebrate my 60th birthday, it was amazing! The staff were very attentive and I was given a birthday cake and a red rose. I went  again 18 months later for afternoon tea which was just as wonderful and then again last week for cocktails, amazing! The views are fantastic and the service second to none.","5","2014-12"
"Heaven on earth","That's how I describe it. I am here for work and I am enjoying it to the most. From checkin staff to food offering its amazing! The whole outlook of the hotel is stunning! I think it's the best hotel in the world. Very friendly and extremely extremely helpful staff! ","5","2014-12"
"Afternoon Tea with an incredible view!","Had a belated birthday celebration the staff were great bringing me my own cake with a candle and a red rose! 
It is expensive but well worth it for the views and ambiance, if you go to Dubai I would suggest booking this up.  We booked the 13h slot and used it as lunch, as there is so much food.","5","2014-12"
"Heaven is a place on Earth","Can you beleieve this if I say "" Heaven is a place on Earth "". My second statement would be "" If you cannot beleieve it Stay at Bruj Al Arab Jumeirah and you will beleieve it "". I recently stayed at this mesmerising hotel during my recent business trip to Dubai. I can definitely call this a 7 star plus hotel. Wow what a great level of service is offered. No words to describe just experience the touch of Luxery.","5","2014-12"

"Afternoon Tea at Junsui (Burj Al Arab) a true experience...","I was not sure that booking the afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab was a smart move for my trip to Dubai, I was concerned that it might have been a waste of money... Long story short... I was absolutely wrong, it was one of the BEST EXPERIENCES ever... The place is amazing! The atmosphere is magic, don't think about the afternoon tea as ""just a drink"" it is a proper meal guided by a selection of tea (cold and hot tea), perfectly driven by the waiters and the rest of the staff, they will assist you, help you, guide you and really treat you like you are the most important thing, and I have to assure you will really feel it. I usually complaine (a lot) when I visit new places, I always find something to complain about... With Junsui you can't go wrong, I am Italian so my tastes are not 100% aquainted to Asian cuisine, even if I like visiting top sushi, Thai and similar restaurants all over world, the 7 course meal I went trough revived some tastes they were in my memory and I haven't felt them for a long time... Like your childhood memories... So, yes it is a bit pricey, buy hey want to remember your inner child... That is the place!!! It worth every penny.
I want to add few words for the waiters (and waitress) who assisted us during the meal. A special thanks to the chef who made special small sandwiches for our child who was a bit picky with the Asian taste. Thanks guys outstanding work!","5","2014-12"
"Beautiful Hotel, Disappointing Service","I visited the Burj recently for a family member's wedding. I have to say that the hotel was absolutely beautiful and the ballroom on the 27th floor was one of the most well designed and exceptional ballroom spaces I have ever seen. 

The variety and quality of the food was also exceptional. The wedding was beautiful and the setting was fantastic.

I did not stay in the rooms so I can't comment on the experience from this point of view.

However, this hotel really let themselves down with regards to their quality and number of waiting staff. I am not normally critical of these things, but we were hungrily waiting in a queue for the afternoon tea buffet for almost half an hour because of poor operational management - only one person serving at a live chaat station. Furthermore, later when dinner was served and I was sitting down, I asked a waiter who was passing water around for a sprite, only to be told - ""It's over there"" - pointing to a table set up on the side. I would not even expect this from a 3* hotel, never mind a 7* hotel.

It seems a shame that on a fairly simple point to organise and control, the Burj let themselves and guests at the wedding down.","3","2014-11"
"Best Hotel in the World","Thank you to the great stuff, Brian gave me a tour of the 7 Star hotel with the Permission of his supervisor Ana. It was incredible. The food at restaurant Sahn Eddar was unforgettable ... thank you, it is worth a 7 star hotel. I felt like a king in great palace...","5","2014-12"
"Fantastic, luxurious hotel","The hotel is very nice and the staff and service is exceptional.  The room is two floors with the bedroom upstairs.  Both rooms have wall to wall windows with ocean view. The complimentary stuff in the bathrooms was by Hermes.  We celebrated our wedding anniversary and they gave us a cake and roses.  We had some drinks by the pool, they were very expensive, about 28 dollars each, which is far too much.  We had dinner at one of the restaurants, named Bab Al Yam, it was an international buffet which cost 275 dollars for two. The food was mediocre, I have been to buffets which cost 50 dollars for two that were just as good. We had a drink in the Sky bar and they were 30 dollars each which is too much. For dinner and drinks you'd be better off going next door to the Jumeirah beach hotel where food and drinks are much better and less expensive. The gym and the spa were excellent. Overall, fantastic hotel.","5","2014-12"

"lunch at Al Mahara at Burj Al Arab","Amazing food and ambiance! Highly recommend! Very nice experience!
We had  business lunch at sea food restaurant AL MAHARA. Appetizer and main dish was very, very good. Also excellent dessert. Service was excellent.","5","2014-12"
"Cocktails in the Sky View Bar or Afternoon Tea.","I visited the Burj Al Arab hotel with a friend for evening cocktails in the Sky View Bar.  I very nice experience and not outrageously expensive but probably the afternoon tea is a better choice for those wanting to take in the view.  Having said that the cocktails were very good indeed and served with very nice finger foods, nuts, mini quiches etc.  For those wanting to eat something more substantial in the evening there is menu for light snacks with a burger and fries at around £20.00.  In general the the hotel is well worth a visit but security is tight and I think it is obligatory to make a reservation in advance and then to quote your name and reservation number at the gate.  You will find details online at the hotel web site.","5","2014-12"
"Afternoon tea- it's ok","This was my third visit for the afternoon tea experience in the Sky View bar. The menu has been slightly different each time but one visit is probably enough just to say you have been. To be fair it is a nice treat but don't expect to be blown away. You get plenty of food for the price and it is of reasonable quality but you are really only paying for a side view of the Palm and BAA name. If you really want a spectacular view of the Palm without the pomp and ceremony try the The Observatory on the 52nd floor of The Marriott Harbour suites hotel. For a fraction of the price you get much superior food in a nice setting with just as great service. Each to their own I suppose and a visit is only really worth it if it you want to say you have been.","3","2014-12"
"An awesome hotel","I really can recommend this for everybody who can affort it. Even after 15 years its still great. I stayed their many times. The service is really awesome. On every floor is a privat butler for you who will take care of all your belongings and everybody greats you with a smile. This is how I want to have my holiday. Fot two people and a child the normal suite is big enough. Now they put the privat beach to the side of the jumeirah beach hotel. On one trip we got tipsy with many bottles of champagne on the private beach that i even lost my slippers. After I told to the barkeeper that I lost them, they brought a fresh new pair from the hotel. This is service :-)","5",
"Luxury Afternoon tea","We were fortunate to be treated by friends to afternoon tea at the Skybar at Burj Al Arab during our recent visit to Dubai. An amazing experience! The surroundings, service, food and attention to detail were impeccable, a truly memorable experience that we will treasure for ever. A ""must do"".","5","2014-11"
"Worth every Star","We arrived from another hotel in Dubai in mid morning and were fortunate enough to get a suite (an upgraded suite) immediately on arrival. The staff, the facilitates, the restaurants are all of exceptional standard. A stay at the Burj Al Arab is something that should be on everyone's bucket list.","5","2014-09"
"high tea at Burj Al Arab","High Tea at BAA early this week was not up to standard. Service was slow, the last 2 courses was served 5 minutes before we were due to leave with our tour guide, and menu coordination was a little strange. However the surrounding decor was lovely and worth the visit. Dunno if I would want to repeat the high tea experience here again.","4","2014-12"
"Dinner at Burj Al Arab","We had a very good dinnerbuffet at this hotel in Dubai. It was very interesting to visit this famous hotel. The service was very good, and so was the food.  It is so beautiful both inside and outside that it is worth seeing.","5","2014-11"
"A MUST experience","If you are headed for Dubai, splurge. Stay at the Burj al Arab for at least one night. The rooms are incredible. Nothing has been overlooked in this 6 star hotel. Service is above and beyond with your needs attended to immediately.","5","2014-11"
"One of a Kind","This hotel is utterly unique. It's big bold over the top grandeur times 10. It is a suite hotel. Our suite was a two bedroom. We went as a family for a four day weekend. Two couples and two children. Our suite included a kitchen, a wee office corner , and a huge formal lounge as well as a family and dining area. The two king sized bedrooms upstairs were both ensuite and sumptuous. The children were in heaven when Thomas the Train engine arrive loaded with sweets and chocolates and that was just one of the wonderful extras that arrived over the course of our stay.. The staff were wonderful and greeted us by name. Nothing was too much trouble.
We had free access to Wild Wadi next door and a very secluded beach club for those who do not care for those activities - and I loved the gorgeous guy who wandered around with ice blocks and cleaned our sunglasses. A wonderful wonderful weekend. The afternoon tea is a must!","5","2014-04"
"Spectacular Views","Afternoon Champagne and Tea is a must if you can do it. The service is top notch and a great opportunity to see the Palm Island shape and some of the world Islands.
We really enjoyed this and and would do again with friends and family","5","2014-11"
"Is not what I thought was going to be","There are other hotels in Dubai or Abu Dhabi thata you dont have to pay to go inside and has a better Lobby areas, very chic designs and architectura, the Al Burj Arab has a lovely architecture from the outside but nothing to offer in the inside.","3","2014-11"
"View from the top","Cocktails in Burj Al Arab - good night. Expensive minimum spend for those that just want to experience the 7✨ Hotel at 320 dirhams per head but this is the cost of a bottle of house wine so is affordable to all pockets. The hotel is a little dated and could do with updating but the service is great, attentive staff with knowledge of all the drinks and make you feel special. Definitely worth a visit for the sky tea or the cocktail evenings. Been many times and never disappointed","5","2014-11"
"Fantastic afternoon tea - a delight","The afternoon champagne tea was recommended to us and since our wedding anniversary was coming up we thought why not. The hotel itself is gorgeous, the decor stunning.   You have a glass of champagne on arrival, Louis Roederer no less. Then 6 wonderful courses of delightful sandwiches, pastries and tarts. The big surprise was the middle course named chef`s carvery. Out came a stunning perfectly cooked slice of waygu beef with a tiny serving of creamed potato. It's the most stunning piece of meat I have ever tasted. While you are being spoiled rotten, a beautiful harp plays in the background completing the beautful atmosphere. Add first class discreet service to this mix and you have a fabulous afternoon. Then as we were leavibg I was presented a gorgeously wrapped long stemmed rose. Bliss !  If you can afford it only once in your lifetime you must try it. You will not be disappointed. And the have cool crazy fishtanks at either side of the escalators !!","5","2014-11"
"Amazing hotel","I love this. Hotel so luxurious the building itself is iconic . Entrance to the lobby is large fish tank walls . The staff are friendly and helpful .  The views are amazing . The gym and spa facilities are awesome , giving a choice if mixed and ladies only facilities . Nothing is a bother for them they will go out of their way to accommodate . Would stay again","5","2014-11"
"Excellent. Awesome night out.","Just left  after 3 hours at the Sky View Bar. Awesome service, cocktails and food. Got moved to a window seat halfway through the night. Best views ever. 4 cocktails, a bottle of wine, two entrees and a beer later, walked away with a $1000 UAE bill, just over $300 AU. For the experience, view, food and drink.... worth ever cent.","5","2014-11"
"Out for dinner","We booked a dinner there one night to experience the place. It is an absolutely beautiful place with heavy security and tons of man power. But the food is not very hot or tasty and is a let down especially when you are paying $100/person. We enjoyed the decorations and fireworks in the Arabian Sea but did not appreciate the food. Interestingly water is not included in Buffett. You have to pay for it. ","4","2014-11"
"Nice Experience","Had Friday Brunch at the Al Muntaha restaurant on the twentysomething floor. The ambience in this hotel is absolutely beautiful. From the moment I pulled up to the front till I got up the elevators, everyone was just pleasant. Even the elevator right was picturesque. The brunch was FANTASTIC. And you get a nice view up there as well. Waitstaff - impeccable; Food - amazing selection. I was stuffed by the time I left the restaurant.

Once outside, they had a golf cart come up and take me to the mall next door to catch a taxi. The man who drove the golf cart was incredibly nice as he constantly stopped to allow me take photos and also helped me take photos at different spots on the grounds. I would definitely recommend this as a once in a lifetime experience.","5","2014-10"
"A treat of afternoon tea","When my now wife and I got together 12 years ago we shared the same passion for travel and we decided that one day we would visit the Burj Al Arab (staying was out of the question). So after many other holidays and with our 7 year old daughter now in tow we took the opportunity whilst visiting Dubai for the day to take afternoon tea. We knew that it could be would be a once in a lifetime treat but why not, to experience the hotel and the surroundings. The 7 courses were excellent as was the ambiance. The only negative was that we had followed the dress code advice to dress smartly but seeing the Russian new money completely ignore this in t-shirts and shorts and be allowed to flout the rules shows that in Dubai money definitely rules. We thoroughly enjoyed the day although it would have been nice to have access to other parts of the hotel given the cost. ","4","2013-12"
"DO NOT GO FOR THE AFTERNOON TEA!","My husband and I went to this hotel to celebrate our anniversary.  The afternoon tea is on the second floor and is about 200 USD.   For that price you get tea, champagne and 6 courses that have scones, sandwiches, tarts, sweets, etc.  What could be wrong? 

You sit on the second floor, looking at a wonderful the Wadi water park out the window, and the hotel's architecture behind you.  There is lovely musicians playing while you slowly enjoy your afternoon tea.

Then...all of the sudden...you realize several tour busses pull up, and the '7 star hotel' instantly becomes an attraction for hundreds of tourists who are not staying at the hotel or partaking in a meal or tea.

It was HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! The tourists swarmed the area in which we were having tea and started taking videos and pictures.  They would stand in between your table and the windows -- blocking your view.   The staff at the tea tried their best to tell the tourists that this place was off limits, but the tourists kept coming, and coming, and coming. 

My husband and I felt like two animals in the Dubai zoo with the way people would just stand by our table and look at us as the view.  This was certainly not something I expected at a '7 star hotel'.  We'll never return.

We did send an email to management who offered us a 'free cocktail table book' for our troubles which we declined.  It was a nice offer, but our anniversary was ruined.

"Great Afternoon Tea","I took my mother here for her birthday as she was visiting me from the states as I live in Dubai. This was my first time there also. 

We had a wonderful experience. You start out with a glass of champagne with a strawberry puff pastry. (You only get one glass of champagne unless you pay for another glass) We both felt like you should get at least 2 glasses. The first dish was beef and mashed potatoes. Ours was hot and very delicious. Then we ordered tea and the sandwiches began. The good thing is that all the beverages and food is unlimited. (Except alcohol) I thought the sandwiches were good. Then you get the scones and pastries dish. We had 2 waiters that checked on us frequently along with the manager. 

When I booked the reservation I stated it was my moms birthday and once we sat down the waiter told my mom happy birthday and then towards the end she got a cake and a rose. 

We both thought it was worth the money and enjoyed our girls day out. The food was fulfilling so don't eat lunch before going.","4","2014-11"
"Even if you can afford it - don't spend more then 2 nights","We were staying a week in this amazing hotel  in February, but we have deferent feeling about all experience. That is the main reason  - why I was not writing review straight after holiday.  First impression was miracle - design, style and  impression - unforgettable. But then it started - Extra bed - halve of day price - was just little old folding bed - not comfortable at all -  in 170 m2 apartment - enough space  for proper extras.  Battler on the floor - is a joke - a person who knows nothing, every question  - they need few hours to found out,  when they change shifts - nobody pass information. They are simply useless and some of them even arrogant. Only once we had a guy who was quiet enthusiastic, but has no authorities to make any decision or help.
Arabic restaurant - just horrible - like some average buffet place in all inclusive, not 5 stars.
Bar on the top floor - with amazing views  and great cocktails... again were spooled impression - they stopped my husband who was very smartly dressed, but had no ""collared shirt"". Ok not big deal, he went to change - but inside were people from outside the hotel wearing dirty t-shirts.
The concierge - fantastic -  great help, very professional. Unfortunately there are girls that should meet  guests on their  arrivals and lead to  apartments  - the most arrogant I ever met. Every time we were coming in or out the Hotel - they  are simply staring people. 
All these minuses should be  improved by management.
The rest -  Hermes perfume and all cosmetic - amazing.  Breakfast - more then anybody could expect. There are so many nice friendly stuff around outside area.  Spa - the best ever. The luxury   apartment were always very clean - fruits in the room always fresh.  We were feeling very safe - Security system is perfect. Probably the stay in Burj Al Arab - is life experience and there is no regret how much you spend.","4","2014-02"
"Excellent afternoon tea","We went there to celebrate my birthday with my daughter and son-in-law that live there.
The hotel looks very impressive and the row of white Rolls Royces at the entrance adds to the atmosphere. Once you pass through the entrance you take the escalator with an aquarium of tropical fish on your right and a stairway of fountains on your left.
There are three sittings on a Friday, 1, 3 or 5pm. We chose the latter and it was nice to see the sunset whilst we were eating.
We were served with a sparkling fig drink when we arrived to our table before being asked which tea or coffee we would like to accompany our meal.
There followed six courses of delightful food. The portions don't look large but we were all full when we left. By the time the last course of buns and pastries we were over faced but you can have as many as you like if you aren't full.
Every time you empty your cup you are asked if you would like a refill or an alternative choice.
There was a lady playing the harp as we ate and this was very relaxing.
The service was first class throughout and on leaving there was a buggy outside to take us the 200 yards or so to the Madinat for a drink.
All in all a wonderful experience. I would like to go again but it's more an occasional treat than a regular venue.","5","2014-11"
"Awesome","I love this. Hotel so luxery. Very cool building. It's nice that your helicopter can pick you up from the roof. When i was in Dubai i bought a new car and the hotel staff helped me with the car:). This is the best Hotel in the world. I love it","5","2014-04"
"If you can afford...you should do it!!!","This was one of the most fun hotel stays I have ever had.  The Burj Al Arab is just over the top cool and the service offered is unmatched.  Entering the hotel past the house cars...uh um...Rolls Royce s... you enter in to a variable wonderland with colors and fountains alike.  Even the smallest rooms is gigantic with a two story layout and all the bells and whistles.  The butlers are over the top helpful and make your stay truly memorable.  

My recommendation here is to visit for a night or two and truly soak in the luxury.  Have the butler draw you a bath....it's unbelievably romantic, and take the time to dine in the Aquarium downstairs.    You will not soon forget your stay and have lots of goodies to bring home with you as well.","5","2014-11"
"A&R in Dubai","Our 3rd stay in this 7th star hotel. Not so sure that it was worth of it.
Jaffar and Eenub butlers of the 16th floor were the best staff during our stay. They were really friendly and took care of us. We really felt that we were welcome in the hotel. 
We have always stayed in one-bedroom suite. It is nice and we had a good view to the palm islands. 
We enjoyed good dinner in Junsui restaurant. It has never disappointed us. During some evenings we were went for a couple of glasses in Sahn Eddar. One evening we also eat something. After they provided meal to us, they left us totally alone. Nobody came to ask how we were doing or how was the meal or if we wanted to have something more. We were close to walk away but then the waitress came. We complained the bad service and the manager came to apologize to our suite. It was too late because the mistake already happened. 
We bought new suitcases and we came to the hotel by bus. We walked to the hotel from the bus stop. After the gate, nobody asked if we needed help. We just took suitcases to the suite by ourselves.  Many staff saw us but nobody provided help. 
Gate before the bridge is still not so well organized. Staff seems to me fed-up with all people who come to take pictures in front of the hotel. Unfortunately the unfriendly attitude is also showed to the hotel guests who walk to the hotel. We walked really often to the hotel so that maybe we should always have taken taxi. 
Hotel manager passed us one morning without saying good morning. When we walked to the elevators and passed him and his colleague, the colleague was really nice and friendly. The colleague say really friendly way good morning. It felt really good. 
Eenub already took care of our transportation to the airport as we asked him to do. One day before our departure, another butler provided us a standard letter including question about our departure etc. I said that Eenub took care of our transportation. Didn’t she have that information and do they really need to provide standard letters in 7 star hotel? 
Staff next to the pool forgot our tea request so that we needed to remind them. 
Arrogant attitude does not belong to the customer service. Staff need to understand that smile and friendly attitude brings satisfied guests back to the hotel to pay their salary. 
We took RR Phantom to the airport and our driver was perfect and friendly. Good end for our stay in the hotel. 
Our Sirius card is on Gold level but it seems to be nothing for the staff. 
Jumeirah really needs to focus on customer service because all cultures does not have same standard. 
We’ll see if we are going to stay the 4th time in the hotel in near future.","3","2014-11"
"Amazing","Stayed for 3 nights in the panoramic suite. The most fabulous hotel I've ever stayed in. Luxury at its finest. Everything and everybody in this Hotel were just first class. It's 3 days I will never forget","5","2014-11"
"I never thought afternoon tea would be so wonderful","A special treat and it was worth every penny.  Sky view bar include 1 glasss of champagne and unlimited teas and coffee which worked well the the afternoon tea.  Chef was very up on my gluten intollerance and also vegetarian and provided to suit, it was wonderful.","5","2014-11"
"Excellent customer services","Our stay in Burj Al Arab was enjoyable.  The hotel (esp customer service) does exceed expectation and we were very pleased.  We stayed in Panoramic Suite with sunset view towards The Palm Islands.  Upon arrival, we were first greeted by the hotel staff at the airport, followed by a bunch of deep pink roses from the chauffeur before our transfer to the hotel. Upon arrival, about 5 staff were lining in a row in the lobby welcoming our arrival, with refreshments, dates, towels etc.  The check-in process was done inside our suite.  Afterwards, our butler showed us around the suite explaining all the features, then prepared the jacuzzi water and unpacked our bags.  Each day when we came back after tour or shopping, the butler will remind us that evening's schedule, also asked us any service that we might want eg shoe shine.  Other staff in the hotel are also very friendly and polite and greet both of us.  Security is quite good as the hotel does not allow non-residence to get through the main gate.  It would be even better if more control over 'day visitors' just for drinks/meal to avoid random people wandering around the hotel (I was asked once in the lift to use my card to access one of the suite's floor!).  Skyview bar was ok, a bit over-polluted by non-residence.  For hotel residence, I would suggest to go there after 10:30pm, seems to quiet down by then.  Food, service and ambience in Al Mahara was good.  Overall, we were happy with our stay and do recommend for those who are into luxurious services.","5","2014-10"
"Disappointed","My husband and I visited for the culinary flight, dining at all the restaurants, from top to bottom, the first stop of the sky bar with cocktails was very Impressive, but from then on, such a disappointment. The quality of the ingredients, is not as high quality as we would expect for around £300 per head with wine! Just an example, the desert was factory meringue, not home made and the brandy was the cheapest brand, definitely a tourist trap experience. Yes it is a beautiful building, and we can say we have been, but just go for the cocktail bar with canapés. Forget the rest.","3","2014-05"
"Amazing evening in an iconic building","Visited Dubai and wanted to go for drinks in the evening at the Burj Al Arab.  The building itself is amazing - both size and the décor.  The staff were very friendly and attentive - but you'd expect nothing less really!  Went to the Skyview Bar for cocktails - great table with a view overlooking Dubai with the Burj Khalifa in the background.  The cocktails themselves, while pricey, were excellent and bigger than expected.  The canapés were really good too.","5","2014-10"
"superb","This was the first time I travelled to Dubai. Needed heat sun sea sand relaxation and luxury. As I walked into the hotel I felt I very happy There was a guy actually polishing the sand off the bushes as I approached the reception desks.  Gold pillars, amazing rose displays, elegant women smiling at you. I knew I had made the right choice. I booked this hotel purely on the previous Trip Advisor reviews. They knew my name as I exit the taxi. Nice touch.","5","2014-11"
"What a super view","Great experience and rather nice hotel in a superb place.
This is a superb architecture which allow the eye to be quite surprised while you are eating a superb meal. I only beleive that the deco of the restaurant could live up to a better standard","5","2014-09"
"what else to say","i've only had the opportunity to try one of the restaurants. the overall hotel seemed outstanding, starting from the entrance, which was quite breathtaking. the restaurant itself was nice and in general it's obvious that the quality is influenced by the incredible context. great experience.","5","2013-12"
"Wow factor! 10 out of 10!","This iconic hotel and its unique setting places it a 100 metres from the beach in the ocean. We had a day visit in this stunning 7 star hotel.  The decor in the foyer - at first it appears kitsch but it's very Arabic-extravagant.  We had lunch at the Al Ivan restaurant.  Nothing short of spectacular.  The views, the food, the service - absolutely superb, all of it.  Before we left the hotel we asked the bell boy to take us to the Sky View Bar to see the views from the 27th floor.  Absolutely stunning.  One can see as far as the next emirate.  Truly a memorable experience albeit it pricey.","5","2014-10"
"Breakfast","As you cannot just go and look around this amazing building, we decided to book breakfast. This was exceptional..lots of choice..beautifully presented and served. Our table overlooked the entrance with views of the fleet of Bentley's, Lamborghinis and Jumeirah Beach. Although expensive for a breakfast, it was worth the £55 for the experience. If you visit Dubai, then you have to come to this iconic building. You are able to visit parts of the building for as long as you want afterwards, and the views from the back of the building over the world islands are beautiful.","5","2014-10"
"Try it - if only once in your life!","Have been to the hotel on two occasions - back in 2003 the first time - the suite was just breath-taking. 
Your own butler, kitchen, lounges, dining room, two bedrooms, sublime views, great food - what else do you need? - Well - fairly deep pockets I guess - but splitting the cost with another couple (two rooms) helps.  Plenty of room for additional guest beds if your want to make full value!  Resturant at the top is amazing - food and views great. 
Very strange to wake up one morning and see the abseiling window-cleaners!  
You must try the afternoon tea too!  Looks and tastes amazing - the hot chocolate is lovely!
I really cannot believe that the hotel has reviews in the poor and terrible categories (or average come to think of it) - perhaps strange preconceptions, a fussy palate, or because it has chosen to attach a 7-star rating it is seen as having to be far better than all of the 5-star hotels in the rest of the area.  Each to their own I guess.","5","2014-09"
"Amazing","Love this place , had  cocktails an meal in Sky bar , yes it is expensive  both for drinks and food (minimum spend rule ) . All was lovely...but has such a wow factor ..staff are fantastic  ! Views amazing ..defo worth a visit !","5","2014-11"
"Afternoon tea","Absolutely amazing experience, spectacular setting.
We had heard a lot about the tea at the Burj but it surpassed expectations.
7 delicious courses beautifully presented, the staff were excellent and a credit to themselves and the hotel, if you are going to Dubai make sure you do afternoon tea at the Burj, you will not regret it.","5","2014-10"
"Unchi Dukaan Fika Pakwaan means Not Worth the Money Spent","Not worth the money spent... yellow gold, white and blue decor combined with mohagany paneling, nut-cracker fountains, an old Rolls-Royce & Bentley at the entrance did not appeal us at all. The food was good but bland... the staff really provided 7 star service... prepared special food for kids when they found out that the kids did not like it, sang songs for us and kids... very personalized and customized service at restaurants and at concierge. Hotel Buggy was a good ride for kids and us to get access to other adjoining Jumerieh properties esp private beach, sounk and Madinat who were not open to public. Buggy even took us to a place where a private bollywood event was taking place and we accidently got entry through Al Qasr - another Jumeireh Hotel connected to Madinat. Anyway, accommodation and views were boring except the feeling of experiencing so called 7-star hotel.","3","2013-12"
"As if we were in the heaven!","Amazing.
The services were extremely perfect. 
The view was wonderful! From the windows, in the left side Palm Islands and the right side Burj Khalifa were both seen.
We are as if in the heaven.
We took a lot of pictures.
We had a lot of fun.","5","2014-11"
"High Tea - excellent experience","For the High Tea we were not able to book the Skyview Restaurant anymore as it seems to be very popular, so we booked for Sahn Eddar. It turned out to be a perfect alternative. 
We were seated at the window enabling us to have a nice view on Dubai and on the things going on at the entrance with people arriving/departing etc. 
A warm welcome with champagne, we even were asked if we had booked for a special event. The High Tea was accompanied by nice harp music, fitting perfectly for the occasion/ambiance. Service was great: nice friendly people and very helpful. Also they had the right combination of being formal/informal. 
The quality and variety of the served food was excellent and we were even served some extra sandwiches when indicating our favorite. Tea & coffee is served as often as you like. Even though people are coming & going because of reservations at certain times, you are not pressed to leave.  When you have the opportunity, make sure to have this experience.","4","2014-10"
"Afternoon Tea","Six of us had afternoon tea on the 27th floor. This was first class, the service was great, the meal was excellent and the view perfect. Glass of champagne to start then the different course. We could not eat all the food. Maybe seems a bit expensive but worth every penny.","5","2014-10"
"Amazing - Heaven has 7 Stars","From the moment we pulled up to the barrier to the moment we left, the service here is amazing, i do not know where to begin.

It was our Wedding Anniversary, and they pulled out all the stops to provide best seats in the restaurant, the Sky Bar , everywhere .........AMAZING

Ignore the negative feedback, this truly lives upto the Hype, Brilliant!!

We had a One Bedroom Panoramic Suite, well worth it, the views simply amazing

Treat yourself !!!","5","2014-11"
"Totaly exellent","We had a dinner on 27th floor and everything was just fabulous.
Everyone were so profesionall, friendly, helpful. Their sommelier gave just  really detailed description about the wines and new everything and had an answer for all of our questions.
Our main waiter or guy who was taking care about us, was positive, friendly and immediately, when one of the tables next to the view was free, offered us to change our table to a table with nice view.
The food was just gorgerous.
Thank you all the staff of Burj Al Arab for a nice evening, we hope to be back soon!","5","2014-10"
"Elegant","Only one word can describe this place, during my night stay it was beautiful, the rooms had everything you needed and staff was above level. Everything in the hotel was done in detail, the best thing for me was the fish tank.","5","2013-12"
"Very Disappointing","My sister and I decided to try the breakfast at the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah during our 2 night stay in Dubai.  For the price we paid, I would say I was extremely disappointed.  I'm a vegetarian and the food I got was worse then what I can make myself.  The best thing was the toast and butter!!  Even the tea was awful.  The staff, on the other hand, were very friendly and professional.  As my sister said, it was an experience, and one that I definitely will not try again.","2","2014-11"
"Amazeballs","Wow wow wow,. This was my first time in dubai,. unfortunately my friend had an accident and broke her wrist,. Just days before we were due to stay at this hotel,. as we were first at the Sofitel.  On arrival the staff here were exceptional in how caring they were towards my friend and did everything possible to make her comfortable,. When we first walked in we were told we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite,. I have never seen anything like it in my travels, and I have travelled lot,. The suite was beyond my expectations, the staff, the food all 7 star plus,. I have decided that I will stay here a couple of days for my honeymoon next year,. Thank you burj, thank you dubai ","5","2014-10"
"Gaudy, and Garish","This heavily touted hotel was a much anticipated stop for my on my trip to Dubai. While I admire the dating design, once you are inside, it is a testimonial to flagrant bad taste, Arab-style. The Lobby looks cheaply furnished, and the rooms and restaurants are more of the same. Service is impeccable. But I'll take a palatial hotel in Europe over this train wreck any day!","4","2013-12"
"simply marvellous","It was a birthday surprise! Got into a private chauffeur organized by my wonderful fiancé, I knew for a fact that its going to be some place nice but then I was wrong it was indeed some place way beyond that. From the doorstep of this incredible place to the room was impeccable. Warm welcome and private butler is always at our service. Room amenities was fantastic, a bouquet and a cake was presented to me. Made reservation at Al Mahara for dinner and it was SUPERB!! such a peaceful atmosphere IT WAS JUST AMAZING..""To everyone out there, do make a reservation at some point =) !"" 
Overall it was fantastic, just would like to thank everyone for the wonderful experience. Keep up the good work! This review is long overdue however its worth to drop down my experience","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea","You just can. Or fault this place and service.  This was a treat for my 50th this year and they were very kind to bring up a small birthday cake with a candle and a red rose.  The staff were fantastic, the service was fantastic and the actual building was out of this world.","5","2014-11"
"High tea at top location","We did not stay in the hotel but went for high tea on the first floor lobby. It's the only way to be able to get into this hotel and the inside is as spectacular as the outside. It' s expensive, you are well served with 7 courses but don't count... It is very expensive... But if you count the view as well, you'll get there. 
Go for a special occasion, treat yourself well and enjoy the luxury.

"top of the world class","it was my first trip to Dubai and my first hotel to stay in A great iconic hotel and nice location staff are friendly and we enjoyed the time with our family hopefully will make it again soon and will recommend it to friends","5","2014-11"
"Afternoon tea disappointment","Visited for afternoon tea very poor for price food mediocre service uninterested and a general feeling been given of "" you are only a day tripper to be put up with and fleeced"" we stayed in another jurmiah hotel and the contrast in staff helpfulness and service was amazing","2","2014-09"
"Sky view Bar","We visited the Burj Oct 2014 for the drinks package in the sky view bar. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty. There was no problem taking endless pics at the hotel. The drive up to the hotel was very impressive with the hotel changing colours. Our car doors were opened for us and we were whisked inside. We wondered around the ground floor for a while taking it all in.then we were ushered up to level 27 to the bar. The views were incredible and service was 110 percent. Every detail was attended to by the hotel. Will definitely return some day.","5","2014-10"
"Great !!!! A lifetime experience to visit the mighty burj","This was an amazing experience from the time you step in to the time you leave..the beautifully crafted Burj Al Arab, the Hotel is filled with glamour. I spent 5 days in Dubai and the number place on my view list to visit was the Burj Al Arab! We had booked for a Breakfast and every course was amazing and the experience of being in breakfast restaurant (sahn eddar )was fantastic This is categorized as  All Suite Hotel. It has an amazing ambiance.  Unbelievable place staff are the most helpful,friendly and respectful in the world. Expensive but worth every single penny. Icon of Gulf !!","5","2014-08"
"Burj Al Arab again!!!","It was our 6 visit this beautiful hotel! I like it very much, because only in this place you can feel so great. It was first time, when we visit Dubai in October. The weather was perfect. Children were delighted visiting Wild Wadi. We enjoyed  to sunbathe. It was very tastefully to eat in Villa Beach restaurant (by the way, you can make the order in this restaurant and to have a lunch right on the beach). It was very pleasantly to recieve a chocolate cake on our anniversary. All our wishes was execute immediately. Staff was very helpful!!!! We have delicious lunch in Al Mahara restaurant!!! And we want to visit this hotel again!!!","5","2014-10"
"Burj al Arab junsui ","We had a high tea for our family organised at burj Al Arab we were taken to junsui lounge on lower ground floor
It has a very nice ambience and specially if u are in a group u r likely to get seated near the windows with. Fabulous sea view
The staff is extremely good and are wonderful at what they do to make u comfortable 
They have a limited vegetarian menu which is not a limitation 
The taste is sweetish of almost all dishes 
Need to specify your taste buds

Must visit place ","5","2014-10"
"Culinary Flight Delight.","My Wife and I booked the Culinary Flight experience for our Silver Wedding Anniversary. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. The whole evening was run with military precision and we were guided from restaurant to restaurant for every course during the evening. When we arrived we were shown to the reception where we were asked to wait to be taken up to the Sky lounge. This gave us the opportunity to take a look at the fantastic interior of this luxurious hotel. We were then taken up to the Sky Lounge and sat at a table right in the window overlooking the fantastic Dubai Sky line. Our orders were taken for Cocktails that we drank whilst talking in the atmosphere and sights. We were handed Menu's to pick each course and were also offered Wine pairing for each course. This was well worth the extra cost as the pairings really suited the courses. From the Sky Lounge we were taken across to the Al Mahara to enjoy our starters, again over looking the city of Dubai from the windows. Then we were taken down to Al Iwan for our second course, which we were sat in a window seat over looking the the Atrium. The Arabic food here was beautiful and the service fantastic. Junsui was our next stop and apart from mixing our meals up with another table, again the food was great  however the atmosphere wasn't quite as good as the previous restaurants. The highlight of the evening was to be the Al Mahara restaurant, dining with the array of tropical fish. The Wagayu steak was cooked absolutely to perfection and the wine pairing again hit the spot. From there we were taken to Sahn Eddar to enjoy our sweet course. As part of the wine pairing, I was offered a Cognac which just finished the night of fantastically. Just when we thought it was all over, they brought my Wife a Red Rose, that they gave me to present to her and also a beautifully decorated anniversary cake for us both. We would personally like to thank the Burj Al Arab and all the staff for making this a night to remember. Thank you all.","5","2014-09"
"Afternoon Tea.....","My husband booked a table for him, myself and our son to visit the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea while we were visiting in August. 
The Burj is a most impressive building from outside, but on the inside its just something else, amazing! The greeting as always  in the Emirates was warm and friendly and after having a look around the entrance lobby and the fountains we were shown to our table. Due to our son only being 8 we were unable to go to the normal restaurant  due to the alcohol laws. So were we seated in the lobby area over looking the entrance and looking out to the wild Wadi and other hotels, not such a view but interesting to people watch. Our waiter informed us of the order of events and I informed him at the start that myself and my son didn't eat beef as this was the hot course and I was given a spinach and ricotta parcel and my son had chicken nuggets and chips! He was very happy. My husband had the beef and he was very impressed. The course of little nibbles kept coming for approximately 2 hours and the staff were very attentive.  The harpist played in the background, which only added to the surreal setting. The scones which came were served with wonderful jams and by they time the cakes came we were full to bursting. When we left we were given a little box of chocolates to take home.  A truly wonderful experience and one to remember always. A beautiful building and a very delious tea.","5","2014-08"
"Experience of a lifetime","The only way to get even if you're not a hotel guest is to book a meal reservation at any of their restaurants. We booked a 4pm afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar. We were let inside 30minutes before. Lobby is gorgeous! Waiting area is really nice. We were asked what the occasion was and i thought i had a bday that just passed so i said it was my bday! We got a table by the window so we could watch the sunset in the Persian Gulf. Every finger food we had was delish!! Incredibly yummy! We enjoyed every bite of it. We had more than enough for all of us. At the end they gave me a bday cake and a rose! It was sweet. Service was a little slow and some of us didnt get a drink they ordered. Waiter must have forgotten. Other than that i give it a 4.5* Something ill do once in a lifetime. Very expensive!","5","2014-10"
"Fantastic Hotel!","I just recently joined the trip advisor and started to write some reviews about the places where i have been, giving such compliments with the places where i had a great time and now i just found myself writing down about this fabulous hotel.
Being rated as 7 stars was amazingly above and beyond of my expectations! It was truly a stay to remember!
Service was impeccable! Each and every staff were very helpful. Breath taking views just paid off the expensive room rate. You will definitely feel sad to leave as the whole experience was truly unique and memorable.
Overall was superb! Highly recommended hotel in Dubai!","3","2014-10"
"Over the Top","This is opulence taken to a new level. They claim 7 stars and we cannot argue with that given the level of personalized service, over the top apartment size room and the whole experience. Our butler was always there taking care of matters small and large, the Hermes gifts were decadent, and the grand staircase in our room that is larger than most hotels make this a truly unique experience. Saying that there is something that is fake about all this oppulance and though I am not complaining I prefer more real than over the top Vegas. Just my preference but again this is an amazing hotel with top notch service. Visit for an out of this world unique stay.","5","2014-10"
"We did not experience 7 stars","Dubai prides itself on wowing its visitors - from the world’s tallest building to the beautifully crafted Burj Al Arab, the city is filled with grandeur. If only they got the simple things right… 

The city as a whole just doesn’t recognise the importance of the human brain when it comes to a trade (like an electrician or plumber) and nowhere is this more apparent than in the service/hospitality industry. It is just not respected as a profession (or paid well) and consequently does not attract the right employees to the region: those who really see that industry as an honourable career. My fiancée and I experienced this inept style of service when we stayed at the Burj Al Arab in July 2014. Yes, on the surface, you have your own suite with ornate finishings and a personal butler, but what good is this if the staff is not trained to think for themselves in performing any duty outside of a basic remit? 

1. We asked the concierge on three separate occasions if we could check out an hour later than 1200 (there was a nice spa slot available at 1100 the following morning which we wanted) and were told each time we would be informed within 20 minutes at our room. Each time, nobody came.

2. On arrival, I was asked whether I would like a newspaper to be delivered to my door in the morning. Yes, I said, I would be delighted to receive a Daily Telegraph. It never arrived. No reason, just nothing. Why ask me???

3. On visiting the Sky Bar we ordered a cocktail. We were served the wrong cocktails. The waiter did not know what drink he was serving us so when we asked if we had the right drinks, he just nodded and grinned. It was only after several sips that we concluded that the two drinks (one gin based and one whisky based) has been served incorrectly and promptly swapped. $75 each.   

4. Another incident at the Sky Bar was a round of free drinks we were served with the shot glasses made of ice. Novel idea, nice touch, but one of the glasses had a hole in the side and the drink then spilt all over my mother in law who was accompanying us. Very embarrassing.

5. We were woken at 2am with a delivery of champagne and cake (to celebrate our engagement), which we had not ordered. I mean, I appreciate the gesture but perhaps use some brainpower and consider that we may possibly be using the hotel room for sleeping and perhaps this is not the best time to call?

6. Breakfast was served to our room. Again, instead of the waiter simply asking who ordered the kiwi juice and who ordered the orange juice, he placed them on the wrong settings. Is asking or confessing to not know an answer deemed unprofessional? 

Whilst I accept these issues could be deemed as minor, it was the collection of errors that bothered us and is not what one would expect from a ""7 Star"" hotel. There was no sense of effective collaboration between staff members. 
Alas, this is inherent in Dubai. Having lived here for a number of years I understand that many who work here do not regard their position with any particular longevity and are consequently are not concerned with being the best they can be. Once their shift is over, things are no longer their problem. This is ultimately a long-term concern for the future of the city. I would implore the Burj Al Arab to defy this trend and provide a competent service worthy of its rating. 

There was of course a positive – the butler: a true craftsman. He knew when to appear, when to disappear and had an air of confidence about him that was so lacking in other staff members.  

By comparison, my fiancée and I stayed in a modest 3 star family run hotel in Southern Germany 2 weeks later and nothing was too much or too difficult for them. Every request was dealt with intelligently and efficiently. It just goes to show that when the basics are done well, with a hint of discretion and logic, a business can go a long way. In this case, I would surmise it is the novelty that keeps the hotel alive, that and a moderately loyal clientele who don’t understand good service.  

Sorry Burj Al Arab but you failed us and I would not recommend this place to others.","3","2014-07"
"Feel sad to leave!","My husband and 5 month year old son visited the Burj Al Arab in September and as a returning customer it did not disappoint. We were torn with either here or Dar Al Masyaf, and obviously price is a big factor, however September has better rates and we treat ourselves not knowing when our next trip will be as new parents.
The staff are wonderful, which definitely made the trip, butlers Karim and Paul are friendly and provide wonderful service. All the staff at Bam Al Yam over the years have been lovely, especially Indin and our son was greeted warmly every morning by chef Harrianne.
The room is one of a kind, and we love returning to it after a day out, where delicious evening canapés are awaiting you, whilst watching the sun setting and appreciating the view. Returning after an evening out, there is a little gift on your bed every night, our son even got a few little gifts too. The complimentary Hermes toiletries are very luxurious, whenever I smell them I am transported back. 
We used the babysitting, which was excellent, thank you Dalmu.
Spa is good but prefer Talsie spa over at Minadat, we have tried the restaurants but we prefer MJ Steakhouse, Segreto and Parilla. 
The pool area is fine but could do with updating and the Burj beach is no longer there due to the new hotel construction and the temporary road from the Burj to Mina Salam didn't appear very safe for walking a pram, as the buggy's drove fast and there was no pedestrian area. 
Although we travelled with a baby through necessity, I would definitely recommend the Burj Al Arab to couples, as you can truly spoil each other with the luxury. I always feel sad to leave and hope I get to return very, very soon.

"Fabulous view","We had booked the restaurant here offers a superb view of Dubai although the glass is slightly tinted. We had booked for the 'high tea' which is extremely expensive for what you get - 1 glass of champagne, some mini sandwiches and mini cakes and a small slice of roast beef. It was close to £100 per head. You are definitely paying a premium to say you've been.","3","2014-10"
"Opulence at its  very best","I spent 6 days in Dubai and the number place on my bucket list to visit was the Burj Al Arab! I had read about its 7 star status and my friends and I booked tea at the Sky View Bar.
Luckily for us we made our booking even before arriving in Dubai since the demand is so high we may not have  gotten an appointment
We arrived 20 minutes early as we were directed  to do and after about 15 minutes we were ushered into the Sky View Bar
The setting was pristine,classy and inviting . We were given a window seat as requested and the service was excellent. The choice of teas was wide. We were served three courses followed by desserts.Everything tasted delicious and one was waited on hands and feet!
We took many pictures of the panoramic view which included a view of the Palm island 

The reception lobby is warm and inviting ornately decorated complete with a large fountain and fish aquarium 
This hotel deserves its outstanding rating
For persons who cannot  afford a stay at the hotel this is a perfect way to experience the opulence of the Burj Al Arab!
An excellent way to spend  an evening","5","2014-10"
"Burj Al Arab - Afternoon Tea at the Sky Lounge","WOW!!! This was an amazing experience from the time you step in to the time you leave... It was a 7 course Tea! Anybody visiting Dubai should at least do this once in their life time. We had a superb view, corner table and an impeccable waiter, Service was incredible! Made us feel so important and part of the Elite....The reason for our visit was my moms 60th Birthday and they made even more special by giving her a rose and beautiful little cake, Yes it is pricy, I wont disagree, but you will most definitely not regret it, it was an incredible experience and will recommend everyone to at least do it once in their lifetime if they visiting Dubai.  Definitely a 7 STAR EXPERIENCE!.....","5","2014-10"
"Wow!!","Unbelievable place staff are the most helpful,friendly and respectful in the world.  Culinary dining experience is unique and one to cross off your bucket list. Expensive but worth every single cent.this is a lifestyle choice hotel everything is 5 star plus.","5","2014-10"
"Sell a Kidney","I just returned from a two and a half week visit in Dubai. Unfortunately i only had one night in this hotel... simply because of the collasal price. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY. The service is what you pay for. To be honest when you first walk in you think the hotel is tacky with their aquarium and gold everywhere but then i took a step back and realized i was in the heart of dubai and i grew to really love it. 

The rooms are really spacious. The service is uncomparrable. If you are coming to dubai you need to just try this hotel just once. If the crazy price tag scares you then i really recommend the Al Qasr hotel which is next door and run by the same hotel opperators.","5","2014-10"
"Burj Flight","My friend was visiting from the UK and we decided to try the Burj Flight where you can sample a course from each of their restaurants starting at the top for a cocktail and canapies at the sky bar.
Every course was amazing and the experience of being in each restaurant was fantastic. Service was impeccable as you would expect would thorough recommend it","5","2014-09"
"Worth experience","We celebrated my wife's birthday in the Skyview Bar, a unique experience! In the moment when you step out in front of the hotel from the taxi, you can immerse yourself in a different world. No matter where in the hotel, you will always smiled friendly, everyone is helpful.
The bar itself, one wishes to be more or less from our eyes. There is no more to say than: everything was perfect!","5","2014-10"
"Incredible Hotel!","We visited Burj Al Arab and had lunch at Al Muntaha.  The food was excellent,  as well as the service.  We were ready to order desert but were pleasantly surprised with several small miniature deserts.  The view was great.  I recommend going during the day, since you are facing the ocean.  Interior is amazing and we took our time taking pictures.  Hotel is expensive so we did not stay there.  Only way to enter the hotel is to make a reservation to dine or for a spa treatment.","5","2014-10"
"Unique Hotel","it's unique hotel in a unique country, I have enjoyed my stay there, staff are friendly and helpful, the variety of the food is incredible, for sure I would like to stay there again, just reduce the price little guys","4","2014-09"
"No other Hotel like it.....","This was our second stay at the Burj Al Arab. There really is no other hotel like it.  

There were however a few niggles, when we booked our holiday as we were staying 2 nights at the Burj and 6 nights at the Al Qasr, we tried to book through Jumeirah reservations and they were to be honest a complete nightmare, they never got back to us, we kept emailing and we eventually had to go through both hotels to get this sorted out.
Also we really missed the extra treatment when you landed and were met from the plane in the Airport.  We arrived and when we got through customs and everything, there was absolutely nobody there and it was only my husband who saw our name on a television screen that we found had any indication we were expected.

Our Butler, though cheerful and really helpful, didn't have a great understanding of English and at times this did become a bit wearing, at one time I think we asked about 6 times to get our complimentary red wine changed to white but thankfully a great guy called ""Ben"" dealt with anything when needed and was a credit to the Burj.
Also we had our entertainment equipment go wrong plus our toilet one night, this thankfully was all sorted out but it involved us hanging around quite a bit and surely this should have all been checked.
Plus when we arrived our Credit Card kept failing, we had to ring our Credit Card company and thankfully we got it sorted out - probably being a little picky here though, we were charged for this call and I think that was a little bit inconsiderate.

However, apart from these few niggles we had a fantastic time, not long enough.
Our Suite which we requested the same as our last stay was given and we loved it.  
Great Breakfasts by really lovely staff and loved the special touches...... especially the Pick and Mix sweeties by the pool - a great new thing.
We still love the Sahn Eddar - this little piece of serenity is one of our favourite places great for relaxing with Tea or a Cocktail and great service, I was a little chilly and a waiter was wonderful lending me a Pashmina - special touches like this make you feel really special.

Our Sky View Bar experience wasn't the best this time.  We were seated at a seat with no view and we could have been anywhere.  The cocktails were okay and the food alright.  Nothing special.

We hated leaving the Burj, it really is a hotel that we love so much and has a special place in our hearts.  We hope to return one day and hopefully get our favourite room again.

So if you are thinking of booking go ahead, there is really No other Hotel like it. xx","4","2014-10"
"Bab Al Yam Resturant","We ate here at quite a large supplement, paid. Food was very poor for the price. Very disappointed for a 7* hotel. Buffet style food, not what we expected. Such a shame as it was our anniversary, and we wanted it to be special.","3","2014-09"
"High Tea with Class","We recently visited the Burj Al Arab for the High Tea Experience in the Sky View Bar. We were impressed with the service, food and the spectaular views. We were celebrating our 35th anniversary and it was a fantastic experience from start to finish. You are welcomed at the entrance to the lift that takes you to the Sky View Bar. The view in the lift is breathtaking alone but when you reach the top the views are amazing. You are greeted once again at the top by more staff and after a short wait are then shown to your table. When we were shown to ours I believe we had one of the best seats in the house overlooking the city and coast. Shortly after we were seated we were served with a berry tart followed by a glass of Louis Roederer Brut N/V poured in spectaular fashion. This was then followed by chefs carvery of the day. Next we were presented with a 2 tier stand in the shape of the Burj Al Arab with finger sandwiches and soft buns. This was then followed by home made scones with Devonshire clotted cream and home made jams. Next we were served a 4 tier cake stand in the shape of the Burj Al Arab with a collection of mini patisseries. This was then finished off with a lychee and rose sorbet. There was an  assortment of teas to choose from served throughout. If that wasn't enough as we were celebrating our anniversary we were also presented with a small mousse anniversary cake and I received a single pink rose which I took with me on our travels to Mykonos and Santorini. We also got to take with us a beautiful pink box inscribed with Burj Al Arab which contained 2 macaroons for breast cancer awareness. This was a wonderful experience and one I would recommend to anyone visiting Dubai.","5","2014-10"
"Amazing Tea At Skybar","We treated sister in law to tea for her 30th birthday which was amazing !! Unforgettable experience and the service and food was superb! Even got given a rose for her birthday!! Thank you for a wonderful time ! ","5","2014-09"
"Amazing!","This is the third time we have stayed here now and every time it just keeps getting better. All the little extra touches, and the staff are beyond words they can't do enough for you!! Just simply amazing!! A special thank you to Akhil and Dom you was wonderful guys :)
Can't wait to see you all again next year!!","5","2014-10"
"7* it is","I spent my 40th Birthday at the Burj Al Arab we spent 5 night there it delivered all expectation a truly magical hotel . The whole trip was a truly wonderful experience highly recommended . The sea food restaurant is absolutely  second to none . We used all the facilities everything was perfect","5","2013-11"
"Unbelievable suite with a pool table","This is the most unbelievable hotel I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  The service is personalized and they anticipate your needs.  The staff was so incredible it defies description.  We stayed one night to splurge for our honeymoon--totally worth the cost--and they upgraded us several room categories to a 3,500 sq ft suite with living room, bar, sitting room, dining room, kitchen, and a HUGE room with an immense snooker (billiards) table.  And that was only the downstairs.  There were so many roses, and candies and amenities in the room that we were overwhelmed.  So many good things to say about this place.  Yes, it's expensive (probably overly so) but it's an amazing experience, from the breakfast to the dinner buffet--both fantastic.  We had a very late evening flight and our luggage was delayed so they let us stay in our room until 7pm and had a staff member personally pick up the luggage from the airport and bring it back so we could change into fresh clothes.  Don't be cheap.  If you are in the vicinity, splurge a bit for the experience of a lifetime.","5","2014-09"
"Burj Al Arab","Ok... This hotel was once upon a time given the title of the ""Worlds Only 7-Star Hotel"" and it stuck to it. So while making this booking for almost 2,000$/per night my expectations where ridiculously high. I was very disappointed... Disappointed by the service and by the rooms. The rooms are very old and need asap renovation. Service was bad... I waited for a Club Sandwich for 65mins. The hotel was very unique yet did not meet my high expectations and definitely is not priced well.","2","2014-07"
"Pure Luxury","I came here for my birthday and this is a real 7* hotel. Everything about this hotel is glamorous and classy at the same time. The decor is dripping in luxurious materials and art, and the staff very attentive. Definitely a place to go if you are looking for something special.","5","2013-11"
"The best afternoon tea ever! A MUST DO IN DUBAI!","I booked high tea at the Burj Al Arab for my three year anniversary. The experience from start to finish was immaculate and by far the best afternoon tea I have ever had! Booking via e-mail is super easy and efficient. The views from around 250 metres above ground level are breath-taking with the Palm Jumeirah and the downtown skyline greeting you on either side of the panoramic glass dining quarter. You can even make out Dubai's newest construction venture 'The world' disappearing into the horizon. The attention to detail was second to none. The afternoon tea consisted of a seven course journey. 

You start with a glass of champagne - Louis Roedderer with a fruit tart which was perfectly matched. The beef dish followed up next with some sweet mashed potato. The sandwiches came next and you are more than welcome to ask for more sandwiches if there is a preferred one. The tiny cakes were so scrumptious alongside the lovely warm scones. We tried the Latte and my oh my the best Latte I have ever tried, also the strawberry and passion fruit ice tea is so yummy you have to try them! To be honest by the end of it we was so full so I advise you to have an extremely light breakfast or if you can try not to have a breakfast. The afternoon tea is 560AED which is around £95 each, which I did not mind paying as it was that GOOD!

You need to secure your reservation in advance with a credit card booking as no vehicles/taxis are allowed into the hotel area without a print out or email copy of the booking. This is a good thing because it maintains the hotel's standards otherwise you will find tourists thronging the place. And reserve in advance for a table with a good view. The quality of the food went hand in hand with the level of service demonstrated by the staff. I also liked the fact that we were in no way rushed and allowed to go at our own pace, take pictures and enjoy the food. I would definitely say this hotel is worthy of the 7 stars! 

The whole experience of even being in the Burj Al Arab itself just adds to the atmosphere and will stay with you forever. You must go it was truly impeccable.","5","2014-10"
"Ok so this is how many stars ?","Let's be serious fabulous location in Dubai but check out the car park and swimming pool ! Not good then the rooms ok fab but the bar not good then the stupid fake bond bar it's not cool it's like star track gone wrong lol ! The prices are crazy and the food not good ! Let's face it is plastic ? And the stupid sub bar Disney do it better ! Rubbish !","3","2014-01"
"the only real 7* hotel","This is a real 7* hotel. the biggest difference between the burj al arab and lets say the emirates Palace is that this hotel only has suites. And the suites are huge, Amazing and well served because of the butler and concierge on each floor. So it is actually like a seperate hotel on each floor with check-in / check-out. That being said we did have some troble with check-out that was handled ok but not great. This is the problem with a hotel of this caliber, there is just an insane amount of presure on every move of the staff, the decor, the quality etc etc. The error was handled and it took us 30minutes, not bad but not excellent. The biggest problem with this hotel is just like other superexpensive hotels, its almost impossible to talk to other guests, everyone is very distant and they dont really want to engage. I get it, but at the same time its kind of sad. So for the experience, for a honeymoon or some special occasion splurge and get a suite on the burj al arab just to have it checked off on the bucket list. For a more pleasureful/complete experience get a suite on the neighboring jumeirah beach hotel for 90% of your stay. But do stay for atleast one night in the burj al arab.","5","2014-05"
"AWESOME suite with amazing view!!!","I stayed in the corner suite with a panoramic view - BEST suite ever!!! (hard to find a suite anywhere else that even comes close) It had two floors and was so huge that I thought the entrance of the suite was still part of the main hotel!

The living room had a breathtaking view (nearly 180 degrees) of the Persian Gulf, its own bar and a 8/9 seater couch in the far corner.

The bedroom on the second floor (up a really long, curved marble staircase) had an awesome bed and massive selection of pillows (that you can request for). Big walk in wardrobe with make up dresser. 

Bathroom has amazing jacuzzi and shower - really really beautifully decorated. Also loved the full sized sets of Hermes toiletries!!!

Reasonable service - staff packs and unpacks your luggage for you. Could have been more resourceful - i wanted chips which weren't available in the minibar / kitchen and staff did not go the extra mile to get them for me. (I am comparing this to service in the Maldives (Taj Exotica) where I forgot to bring my eye mask for sleeping and the butler went to the main island to have a tailor sew me one. You would expect exceptional service at a hotel like this).

Transportation to the hotel was nice in a Rolls Royce but the driver was 45 minutes late and drove to the wrong area of the airport for pick up - very poor.

Very nice underwater restaurant - look out for George the resident fish! 

Spa is huge with its own pools, facilities are separate for women. About 400 for a massage but you get a tub of bath salts as a gift - very nice!

Would most definitely stay in the suite again - absolutely breathtaking!!!","5","2013-11"
"Just average","Didn't stay here as a guest but made reservations for food and drinks at the sky bar.

For a 7* establishment there's nothing special. The waiter who served us sounded so robotic and almost scripted in what to say, ( as what he said to us was almost word for word to what he said to the couple sitting next to us) around £25/30 for the cheapest cocktail

The food was okay but that's it just okay (Would I eat it again or recommend it to someone ..? - No)

We went at night so the view probably would have been better in daylight (obviously no fault of the hotel)","3","2014-10"
"Wonderful","We went to sky bar at 27th floor for an afternoon tea. We booked some month before going using their website, it was very simple and you can find also details about the dress code. We arrived half an hour in advance and the staff made us wait outside of the elevator in a waiting room outside the sky bar. The staff made us enter calling us at the booking time. When we booked the table, we also asked for a table with a view on the city. The staff gave us one of the best tables in all the bar so that we made a lot of photos. During this lovely experience lasted one hour and half, we ate a lot of food, both sweet and salty. Amazing the beef with delicious mashed potatoes, excellent the homemade jams. They offer you also a glass of champagne ( that you can choose among some fine brands) and obviously a tea. This afternoon tea include also some sandwiches, cookies and pastries. The overall quality is very high, and we can say that we were totally full and satisfied.","5","2014-01"
"Cocktail at skybar","Expensive-sure. But it was well worth a visit! Astonishing architecture and incredible view from the bar! They also have some food on the menu so plan to have your dinner here and the 320 aed, although very much money, is not qute that terrifying anymore.","4","2014-10"
"Amazing","This was truly an amazing experience! We stayed at this hotel during the summer and this hotel truly proves why it is one of the most talked about hotel in the world!! The service is very warm and friendly. They make sure that you are treated like a VIP. Upon arrival we were upgraded which was surprising! The rooms are very spacious and welcoming. The food was great and the infinity pool was an exceptional experience! Will soon be returning to this amazing hotel! Thank you for making our stay so amazing!","5","2014-05"
"Skyview Bar: An experience to remember...","We live and work in Saudi Arabia and it was the first time we went to Emirates during the Eid holidays. In Dubai, Burj al Arab Hotel is an icon that I always wanted to go and feel the experience.
We didn't stay at the Hotel but we went to the Skyview Bar. It was an amazing time to be so high and with a wonderful staff to arrange for all our needs. First it was very easy to book by phone and when we arrive we were seated in a table not near the window but as soon as one gets available they transfer us to a window by table. 
What an experience!!!!!!!
The food was a must, just the perfect quantity and vey well served and the problem was to chose what to drink because the offer is enormous.
A very nice experience that don't disappoint us and we should repeat.","5","2014-10"
"What an experience.....","Decided to have a treat while in Dubai and booked a twin suite in the Burj al Arab.  Arrived around 12 for the Culinary Flight lunch and left bag at concierge until after lunch.  At 3 o'clock when to checkin and to our surprise were told we have been upgraded. Absolutely amazing experience, 2 huge sitting areas, full size dining table, kitchen, two bedrooms each with ensuite and Jacuzzi. Toiletries are full size Hermes. Sunbathed outside for  while then went to the spa, watched the sunset from the infinity pool. Ordered room service and in the morning had breakfast in suite.  There was enough for 4 people not 2.  Will definitely return asap","5","2014-09"
"Skyview Bar","We didn't stay at the hotel. We visited the sky view bar with a group of business men to experience the Burj al Arab. The reception is most friendly and warm. If your underdressed the will help you to get dressed. The view and the bar are a nice sight to see. The service took to long. The have a diffulculty serving lager groups. The staff can't remember orders and we had to wait to long for our drinks. The service personel stayed very friendly.","4","2014-10"
"Sky View Bar.","This was probably the most expensive afternoon tea I ever had but I was aware about the price when I booked it. I didn't stay in a hotel (I wish) and even to get to the hotel ground you need to have a booking. Hotel itself looks out of this world. Very grand, lavish and just over the top, but on a good way. We explored the lobby with the fountains, fish tanks before getting into the glass lift. Sky View Bar has top to bottom windows and outstanding views of Dubai. We were lucky to be given a table by the window. Service was flawless together with the food. As it was just before Christmas we were also offered some traditional Christmas cakes on top of usual menu. We were treated really well. Life music just added into the experience. The whole place was buzzing and lively.","5","2013-12"
"Friday Brunch is a Must-Do!","I visited the Burj Al Arab on Friday, September 26th to attend their famous Friday brunch. I honestly thought that the staff would treat me differently because I was not a guest of the hotel but everyone was super friendly and super accommodating.  The food was AMAZING! There was sooooooo much food it was overwhelming. Everything tasted wonderful. The mountains of seafood was so fresh and everything duck was DELICIOUS :)  The view is breath-taking and the staff was more than happy to take pictures of my friend and I. And the service! Everytime I left the table and returned, my finished plate was cleared, utensils returned and my napkin was neatly folded. 

Yes - it is expensive but is totally worth saving to do. Honestly, there's no better way to get into the Burj Al Arab to see the beautiful architecture.","5","2014-09"
"Great experience","I stayed with my husband and dined and in the sky view bar which was an amazing experience. The view and the live music in addition to the great food and drink. Of course it is not cheap place to go, but worth the cost.","5","2014-03"
"Amazing service and the best spa experience I have ever had","We stayed in the panoramic suite for 4 nights. The staff from the concierge, butler, and restaurant staff were amazing. So opulent and we were treated like royalty.  The Talise Spa is the best spa I have ever been too, and I do like to indulge myself in spa services when I travel.  The massage was the best I had.  Although the hotel is expensive, it is definitely worth a stay to be pampered.","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea. A Once in a lifetime experience for most folk.","You can't even get to the hotel without having a valid booking as it is connected to the mainland via a causeway with security guards well before you get near. 
We had made our reservation earlier that day so we were allowed through. Our chauffeur delivered us to the main entrance and left to find somewhere to park. 
The entrance is an extraordinary mix of arab culture and over the top opulence. There is a water cascade between the two escalators to the next level where fountains play games for the onlookers. In the walls is a two story fish tank to complete the at-sea effect.
We were shown to our table close to where a delightful young lady played the harp. You would not believe her repertoire which covered just about everything from classical pieces to Elton John and even to my delight Led Zeppelin's stairway to heaven. 
The waiter explained that we were about to embark on a seven course afternoon tea. This comprised of tiny hors d'oeuvres, miniature sandwiches, traditional pastries, roast beef medallions with creamed potato, smoked salmon with toast and two sweet dishes. Thankfully each course was very small but by the end we couldn't eat another thing!   Each course was delicious but my favourite was the beef medallion. This was melt in the mouth tender and gorgeous. 
One has to remember this is a 7 star establishment so one would expect no less but even at the eye watering price it is well worth it just the once....unless I win the lottery in which case I'll be back!","5","2014-05"
"Amazing","Great experience, amazing views.
First class service, a must do when in Dubai. 
We had afternoon tea in the sky bar which was fantastic with amazing views.
The whole experience from walking thro the reception to the glass elevator was A1.","5","2014-09"
"Very expensvie but worth it for a treat your treated like a king","I visited this hotel with my son it is very expensive but for a one off experience worth the money. Everything is expensive here but it is a 7 star hotel so you would expect it to be. A bottle of water with our meal was £15.50 so just be careful with what you have as extras. The service is great but after a short while becomes a little over the top and you feel its a bit fake. Great for a short visit and a fabulous experience if your in Dubai its worth going here.","5","2014-08"
"Fantastic!","We were staying at the Zabeel Saray and had booked the Culinary Flight in Burj al Arab, so decided to make a day and night of it and opted to book a room too...Wow!  This place is amazing!
At check in we were advised we had been upgraded to a 2 bed deluxe suite, which was very impressive and huge.  
The pool area, spa, restaurants, service...everything in hotel really, is superb.
This is our new must do in Dubai - at least one night of every trip in Burj al Arab.  Can't wait to get back!!!","5","2014-09"
"Great","It was great
A bit over price y 3-4 meals cost around 250£ I would recommend this place to wealthy people but anymore can do it
It's clean nice
Not comfortable bed 
The service was alright bit slow though but some people would argue they have enough money to give people great service but I think they are doing a great job with all the customers they get every day -around 1000 customers per day-","5","2013-11"
"Afternoon tea in a great location","This is not the first time I have visited the Burj Al Arab. From the moment you step through the door to the minute you leave you can't fail to be impressed with the decor and sheer scale of this hotel. 
This is the first time I have visited for afternoon tea. 
We both found the food selection to be good but just missing the extra special touch associated with the Burj. 
I would visit again for dinner but feel I have now experienced afternoon tea and for the price felt a little disappointed. ","3","2014-09"
"Nothing left to chance","Our stay on the 16th floor of this magnificent hotel was orchestrated beautifully from airport pickup to drop-off!  The staff made sure our every desire was more than satisfied and each day was made more special than the next!  The first night we had a delicious and romantic dinner in our suite after a wonderful couples massage....perfect after a very long trip from the U.S..  The final night we had a fabulous meal at Al Mahara, a nightcap at the Sky Bar and returned to our suite filled with rose petals, music, candles and a jacuzzi tub in celebration of our anniversary.  In between we enjoyed the executive pool where again the staff exceeded our expectations.  The hotel is filled with beautiful shops, and magnificent decor including the fountains and aquariums.  This luxury hotel delivers all it promises and more....you will not be disappointed.  Thank you to our wonderful butlers who went above and beyond to make sure we wanted for nothing.....every expectation more than met.","5","2014-09"
"Cocktails shaken to perfection","As a treat for our visitors we chose to visit the Sky View Lounge at the Burj Al Arab for cocktails. It was a very pleasant evening and the range of cocktails shaken to perfection is extensive, yet very pricey. The staff were attentive and the service is amazing.
I was slightly disappointed with dress of fellow visitors, some were dressed in jeans and rugby shirts, not the attire I would have expected for a 7 star venue. All in all a lovely night but people please put more effort into your party clothes! ","4","2014-09"
"Probably the best in the world","First of all, I would like to thank BAA reservation team for their help and support in arranging the booking for our suites at the hotel and making it as easy as possible with all of our requirements and needs..

We had a great welcome from the moment we entered the hotel with the staff offering us with sanitized wet towel and sweet dates with Arabic coffee.. The we had a special guide that explained for us everything about the hotel facilities and the suites that we booked at the hotel..

The suites that I stayed in with my family were better than what you see in pictures..in will describe them in three words: large, comfortable and luxurious..

The butler services at each floor was the best thing that I have ever seen. Always greeting you with a smile and escorting you to your suite every time you arrive at the floor..

Hopefully will return in the future to live this wonderful experience again..","5","2014-08"
"Amazing!","We stayed for three nights during our visit to Dubai.  The service was incredible! From the airport transport to the in room treats and fantastic restaurants.  It was truly a wonderful experience and we couldn't have asked ask for a more romantic getaway.  We enjoyed all the hotels we stayed in while visiting the UAE but this one stood out because of superior service and elegance.  The service was great; the staff was always available without being intrusive.  Definitely stay here if you have the chance.","5","2014-02"
"A luxurious Treat...!","What a birthday to remember!  We had been for dinner on 26th of sep to celebrate my birthday. We opted for Al Iwan restaurant's buffet spread.  The Hotel is breathtakingly beautiful... After our dinner I was complimented with a birthday cake and a rose.  One of my best birthdays ever. ..😍😍😍","5","2014-09"
"Miles of Smiles","Picked up at airport and got checked in early and lovely upgrade...Thank you BAA. We spent two nights here and the staff are fantastic. From the doormen, butlers, chefs, waiting staff and pool attendants. We have been a number of times and always know there will be a new experience. Had a great massage done by the lovely Cora. Beautiful dinner as part of our package in Al Iwan. Thanks to the people involved in help us celebrate an anniversary. The Burj does this in style can assure you. Our biggest thanks go to the housekeeping staff, Stephanie Sawada ( a shiny star) and finally Nimal Joseph who I consider a friend indeed...We will be back very soon..","5","2014-09"
"Outstanding","We visited the Al Muntaha restaurant at Burj Al Arab for Friday Brunch.  The Al Muntaha do a Friday Brunch which of course is like our Sunday Lunch.  This is in the style of a buffet.  From the moment you enter the outside gates till the main entrance of the hotel itself, you feel an excitement of grandeur.  Once inside this spectacular place you are left mouth opened at the design, colour and sheer magnificence of it's luxury.  The Al Muntaha restaurant is reached with a glass elevator that transports you to what seems to be an unending floor in the clouds.  Then you are kindly asked to be seated to add to the anticipation, then after escorted to your table were you realize you are at the top of the world.

The food itself is never ending.  Even the most hungry of us all would not be able to taste one quarter of what is available.  A unique taste plate after plate.  The best chefs in the world at your service.  Be it at the starter level or at dessert, you cannot ever match it's taste.  You just sit there and feel amazed, first at the quantity of food before your eyes, then at the quality of the displays and above all, the best food you'll ever taste.  Everything of high quality with exotic foods, cooked before your eyes.  Whether you are a lobster lover or a carnivore you are assured to be spoilt for choice.  We had read a lot of reviews about Al Muntaha and not all of these were good.  Mostly because the food was not enough for the price they paid or that they expected better taste. Well if you dare to go, go to the Friday Brunch.  You will not be disappointed, money extremely well spent (even if it is not your normal budget) in return for an experience of a lifetime!

"All That Glitters Here is Gold","Visited the Burgh Al Arab Sky View Bar for High Tea and proposed to my partner. Planned this event specially, contacted the Burgh by email as this is the only way you can get in if you are not lucky enough to be staying there. Using your phone to video is strictly forbidden (taking photos is allowed) The Manager made an exception for me and actually videoed my pros pal for me using my phone. This place befits it's seven star rating, it is a paradise and the staff treat everyone as if they were Royalty. You are greeted by smiling well dressed smart looking individuals at every turn and they really do go that extra mile to make you feel special. You are allowed to wander around the foyer andvthe gold lifts before you take the special express elevator to reach the Sky View bar. My partner has a garlic and onion allergy which I told them about in my email. I needn't have worried, the staff were on it like a car bonnet and she was in the safest of arms. We were allowed to stay up there for about three hours and had cocktails with other guests later. The view of Dubai from up there is breathtaking, such beautiful architecture. The food and drinks are all wonderful and you get more than enough to eat, there was no way we could finish ours, something like 7 rounds of sandwiches and cakes were brought for us to gorge ourselves on. It was a breathtaking experience. From the aquariums lining the walls next to the escalators to the Golden fittings and the wonderful bar on the 27th floor. Simply exquisite.","5","2014-09"
"7 star Quality","We have high expectations and the hotel way exceeded the expectation.
Upgraded to a 2 bedroom 2 floor suite. Huge reception room, large second lounge, kitchen, cloakroom. Maids room, bar and this is just the first floor. Second level with 2 huge bathrooms and bedrooms. With their own lounge space, dressing rooms etc. in excess of 6,000 square feet. Hermes toiletries, super fast wifi, TVs everywhere a great hotel with Super restaurants, great breakfast, wine free and tons of fruit. Personal butler and a feeling of a home away from home....but 100% luxury.....well worth the money......you will not regret....","5","2014-09"
"Afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab","If there's one fabulous thing that you do when visiting Dubai, its to book afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab in their Sky View Bar.
This was an an experience that I dont think can be topped anywhere else in the world.
Although initially when you book it, it seems a little expensive, but its an experience that you will never forgot and can never be recreated anyway else in the world.
The quality of ingredients used is second to none, and the staff work exceptionally hard to make your afternoon incredible and to make you feel special. 
One I would do again when I revisit Dubai.","5","2014-09"
"Amazingly opulent - stunning hotel, but very pricey","This is the most decadent, luxurious and frankly extravagant hotels I have ever been to. The location is wonderful, the materials and feel of the hotel just shout no-expense-spared. There is even a giant fish tank at the side of the escalators and the finest finishes all over.

The staff were all extremely friendly and attentive without too much pretence.

There are shops (out of my budget!) for gift etc in the lobby.

Security on to the site is quite stringent, you must have a reservation to even get on to the grounds. You can call up for these, though.

Afternoon tea with a glass of Champagne is just under £100 each (wagu beef option on the taster menu was the nicest meat I've ever eaten) but add a couple more glasses of wine and some other bits and you will easily double that. You're paying for the very finest things available to eat, provided at a level of service rarely experienced.

The Britannia Silver cutlery was made in Birmingham, which was an unexpected touch!","5","2014-09"
"Just Amazing!!!!!","Where do i start.......
This is the most luxurious hotel i have every stayed in and probably will stay in.

From the moment we were picked up from the airport in a very nice car, i was greeted with a bouquet of roses and a very helpful driver. We were transported to the hotel in style and arrived very quickly. At the door we were greeted by the hotel staff offering cold towels and drinks.
The check in takes place inside your suite by your personal butler. He was very helpfull and welcoming showing us around the suite and then a tour of the hotel and its facilities.

Our 2 night stay was filled with everything the hotel has to offer, we made sure we sampled everything they had including the pools, beach and restaurants. 
We made the most of the room by having breakfast delivered on both mornings, which was very nice just stepping out of bed, going downstairs to it all set up on our very own dinning table.
The butler was outside the room at all times, he was extremely helpfull and nothing was a problem. Every time we left the room or came out of the lift they stood to attention and always greeted you by name.

As this trip was a gift from my husband for my 30th birthday the staff made it that little bit more special. On the first night the butler came in the room along with 3 other members of staff, one with a guitar and sang happy birthday to me. They had a tray with a chocolate cake on and a bouquet of red roses. I was wished happy birthday a few times during my stay by different members off staff in different areas, the attention to detail was second to none.

I could go on and on about my stay in this hotel but i would be here a while, overall i am so impressed that i want to stay here forever. I can easily see why it has the high rating it does. The rooms have everything to offer as does the hotel and the surrounding grounds.

Most amazing hotel experience i have ever had. Well done Burj Al Arab!!!!!!","5","2014-09"
"Royal","If you are in honeymoon or special anniversary, this is the best place in Dubai to spend a very relaxing and royal moments with your loved one.

All the rooms are suites and its very specious.
Also you will have free and unlimited access to Wildwadi water park, which really worth a visit. 

The suites are two floors with elegant decoration, its very charming and romantic rooms.","5","2014-08"
"Worths every dollar","Simply one of the best hotels in the world!!! You get what you pay for. Luxury, professionalism, services, views, environment, architecture. You feel that you live inside a modern monument.  Worth to visit Dubai just for the experience of staying in this hotel.","5","2014-09"
"Wow ! ","Best place on gods green earth !... Nuff said !!!! A special thanks to Sylvia , sky bar manager who took us round the hotel, with a pride that only comes from enjoyment of her position !! Truly astounding place . 
Thank you so much Sylvia for hospitality x","5","2014-09"
"Amazing Luxury","First up I've sadly never stayed here but I've visited it for numerous meals at their restaurants (separate reviews). Despite it being an uber luxury hotel the staff are all helpful and respectful. Luxury and class.....love the place!","5","2014-09"
"Nice but very expensive..","It is kind of an Icon in Dubai so we  reserved a diner at the 27th floor restaurant. The hotel is incredible, very chic, luxury at the max. There was smog when we were in dubai so the view was not that great and if you sit near the window, take the side that have flat window because the angle in the others prevents you of having a nice view. 6 courses menu, everything very good, very well made and presented.Portions so big, we were not hungry anymore after the 3rd plate. Wine is very, very expensive.. 10 times the price of a liquor store.. That is way abusive in my book. So a meal for two, with and ok wine.. $1000 us.. Maybe for a special occasion but still, very expensive.","4","2014-09"
"Wonderful ","As expected,  this hotel was truly wonderful.......  The whole place really is something to be seen. The surrounding area looks beautiful, the view from the restaurant allows some of the best in Dubai. Yes it's expensive,  but you get what you pay for,  and this hotel is fabulous. ","5","2014-09"
"Incredible 2 night treat!","I decided to book a 2 night stay at the Burj Al Arab as a surprise for my girlfriend at the end of our trip to Oman.

By far, the most expensive hotel I've ever booked, but worth every penny.

I also booked a Rolls Royce transfer from the airport.
This was great, as when you arrive at the hotel, you are greeted by a team of friendly staff waiting to take your luggage, and offer you a drink and sweets.

Check in is handled in the suite, which is really nice.

Given a guided tour around the suite,  which was really helpful, as there is a lot to it!

Love the split floor - gives plenty of space to lounge around and relax.
The bed (Dux) was literally the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on!

Spent most of the day by the pool, which is fairly small for a hotel of this size, but perfectly maintained, and serves its purpose.

Watching the sunset here was lovely too.

You also get free entry to Wild Waddy which was really fun.

We had dinner in the Al Muntaha restaurant on our second night. 
Was a really nice experience
Only *slight* complaint for this restaurant was the order was misheard -
We ordered the Wagyu Beef for 2, which included 3 sides, but when the bill arrived, it was apparent a single wagyu beef, plus the sides, had been ordered.
This was quickly rectified by removing the sides from the bill, which was fine.

Some people find the butler being pretty much outside your sutite 24*7 intrusive, but honestly, they are very discreet and do not disturb you.

Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a bit of a treat.
Yes, it’s expensive, but life is for living!","5","2014-06"
"Luxury at its best!","The Burj al Arab is truly outstanding...the self proclaimed 7 star hotel is everything they promise you! It is bright and colourful...It is very expensive...as expected...I think I paid about $30 US for a salad, and the drinks were rather pricey as well. We hung out by the pool all day, went on a walkabout of the Hotel, it really is amazing, its a must see if you are in Dubai","5","2013-12"
"Truly  outstanding","Wow I had a surprise stay with the Burj al Arab in June of 2014. From the entrance welcome to meeting our butler to seeing our fabulous room I was amazed. The building is just jaw dropping. Filled with gold decor and luxurious soft furnishings alls I could say was nothing! Once we where shown around our room facilities we decided to take a look around. We took a buggy over to the nearby Jumeirah beach hotel. We located the beach and where shown to our sunbeds. Now unfortunalty we came across another guest who didn't want us near them and there was a bit of confusion at first but the staff dealt with this perfectly and the lady moved a few more sunbeds away. We where provided with soft white towels and a ice bucket with lots of water. A waiter came offering strawberries which was very welcome in the hot weather.  We decided to room dine with the children so they could make full use of the jacuzzi bath and TV dinner. We dined al le carte ... Beautiful! We ordered curry one lamb dish one chicken. Absolutly stunning. Our room had the most comfiest bed I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. The baby had a lovely cot and children a made up bed. Although my little boy was more than happy to sleep on the armchairs filled with duck feather. :-) we had breakfast in the Chinese restaurant wow again amazing food. Chef made us special beef. Yummy. Couldn't ask for a more amazing stay. ","5","2014-06"
"Afternoon Tea On The Sky Deck","After 3 previous trips to Dubai, I decided it was time to visit the most famous hotel in the city and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is indeed very special and unique and arriving at the entrance you feel you are about to enter one of the most iconic hotels in the world. Sky tea is hosted at the very top of the hotel with amazing views across Dubai. However, if you want to sit eating you're tea soaking up the incredible views, my advice is to register your arrival at the sky tea reception as early as possible, otherwise you will be disappointed. Seating is allocated on a first come first serve basis, so if you register your arrival early, you are shown to the best seats. The alternative is a table towards the middle of the room with your views of amazing Dubai obscured by your fellow patrons enjoying their afternoon tea. This was never explained to me. I was one of the first to arrive but rather than endure yet another holiday queue I decided the best thing to do was to hang back........big mistake! 

The vast majority of people enjoying tea were couples. Some of the women in those couples were presented  with a red rose, I'm not sure why. Once again this was never explained to me when I booked the tea. My guess is they were celebrating some sort of event, such as an anniversary. Why not present a rose to all couples as afternoon tea at the Burj can be deemed as a romantic event?

Despite having the worst seat in the house, my partner and I still very much enjoyed the experience. The staff go out of the way to make you feel special and provide a very attentive service. The Burj management however should advise on booking that seating by the windows is subject to limited availability to manage people's expectations when they arrive!","3","2014-09"
"Luxurious and Opulent","The Burj al Arab is everything it promises to be and more. We have stayed at many five star hotels, always chuckled about the Burj's self proclaimed 7 star status, but indeed the difference with other hotels is prominently present in each and every aspect.
We spent my 50th birthday here and, although we messed up the booking and arrived a day early, we were welcomed gracefully, all restaurant bookings were amended and our room was ready after lunch. 
The suites (one can hardly call it a room) are huge and gorgeous. Even if opulence is not your thing, in this environment it suits and exceeds every expectation. Service is impeccable, but whereas all the attention could make you feel uncomfortable all staff has the ability to make you feel at ease.
We opted for The Culinary Flight for lunch, a course at each of the Burj's restaurant, and were escorted by each resaurant manager from one restaurant to the other.  It's a great way to sample each restaurant and a truly memorable experience. After the extensive lunch there was really no need for dinner and we had some snacks at The Skyview Bar. 
The following morning we had breakfast in our suite and as it was my birthday I was greeted by a mariachi band made up of the floor staff. Really sweet, roses, cake etc.
After a leisurely day at the pool and a late check-out we finished our stay with an Afternoon Tea. Delicious as always, the best in Dubai.
I would say the only downside to the hotel is that nowadays bus loads of Asian tourists appear to choose The Burj al Arab as their local hotel, so it takes away some of the exclusivity.
Other than that it was a once in a lifetime experience. Although......","5","2014-08"
"11 out of 10","Staying at the Burj is like getting a glimpse of the lifestyles led by the most rich and famous. Every desire is catered to. Needs are anticipated. Your opinion is of utmost importance. And everything is always possible.

From the moment we arrived we had a feeling that this is a hotel taking one step further than everyone else. The decor might appear gaudy in photos but somehow it fits in the context of what the hotel is and is meant to be. A butler (real one, not just someone who greets you every now and then), an iMac, a spiral staircase, Hermes amenities, a TV that floats up and down, door cameras, and on and on. One could easily get used to this!

We ate at both the upstairs restaurant and the seafood one with the aquarium. Both great experiences but (as with other places in Dubai) we found the view wasn't as fantastic at the top as we expected. Maybe already living in a city with a more populated urban environment was part of it but overall we preferred the seafood restaurant with its freakisly-eyed blue grouper keeping us company. 

Of course one pays for all this extravagence, but it's not just an expensive hotel stay- you're paying for an experience that's different from anywhere else in the world. 

Only issues we found were a problem with the Jumeirah email for the Burj- no answer and then it bounced back after several days. I was attempting to reserve a table at a restaurant but it wound up not being an issue anyway as the friendly person who led us to our room made the booking for us. And after checking out there was minor chaos out front as what seemed to be a small bus of Chinese guests was unloading and lots of people were standing around blocking the entranceway. Aside from these small issues it was a flawless stay.","5","2014-08"

"excellent choice","Great venue, very delicious food and extremely excellent and professional staff... its worth the visit... if you didnt visit yet it should be on the TODO list.
At the end it remains to be a niiche and special hotel 7 stars hotel. from the moment i booked on the phone till we got out of the hotel everything was extraordinary, my wife and myself we loved this experience, and sure will visit again","5","2014-09"
"So disappointing!","Wow!  It started off badly when it took four emails to correctly book an afternoon tea for two - they just kept confirming it incorrectly, (time, date, type of tea etc) additionally every email I sent received an auto response to say that they would respond, it was ridiculous!

When we arrived at the Hotel, our car door was opened but nobody greeted us or inquired as to where we needed to go.  We found a member of staff and asked for directions to the lobby.  When we arrived, there was no clear point of entry, no staff...nothing.  We just loitered on the left side of the lobby and eventually we were told to take a seat.  Shortly after we were shown to our couch and tea table.  I was really, disappointed.  I have never been to a 7 star hotel before and frankly the furnishings looked generic and a bit like the inside of a ferry.

Waiter number one arrived and explained that we would be having seven courses - I explained that I was gluten intolerant and had advised them in my booking email.  The first course for my friend consisted of berries on a puff pastry, I simply received three berries on a bed of ice!  The next course of  roast beef was small and nondescript, the sandwiches were open and all served on one type of flavorless, unleavened bread.  The sorbet (a sorbet is not a food course, it's a palate cleanser btw!) was average, the scones were actually dangerous!  I have no idea what the chef used to cook them (caustic soda?!?) but scones should not crumble when barely touched and burn the inside of your mouth!  I finally drew the line at the ""pastries"".  These were actually stale...and the waitresses description of them was priceless!  She asked if we would like to know what they were and it went something like this...""This one is a brown kind of cheese cake with a tart topping, this one is chocolate with a sort of creamy top...""  She obviously had no idea what any of them were.  I didn't eat them as one of them was seriously moldy tasting and when the next waitress came to clear away the plate she asked if I had enjoyed my food.  I said quite clearly, ""No"", she laughed and walked away.
I spoke to the manager eventually, who apologized and admitted that gluten free afternoon tea is not something that they do regularly and he removed the charge and gave me and my friend a gift to say sorry.  While this was appreciated, I would just really have preferred to be told that they did not serve GF afternoon tea and I would not have booked it.  A seven star hotel should not do ANYTHING badly!
The inside of the building is interesting to look at from an architectural viewpoint but I've been in many buildings that were far more impressive than this sadly.","1","2014-09"
"sailing in the burj!","We have been lucky enough to have a number of stays at Burj al Arab. It still remains 7 star. People have asked if it is gaudy! No it is very rich in colour. The suites are huge but furnished impeccably and suit The Middle East feeling. Service is impeccable at all levels.breakfast room overlooks the ocean and the food buffet transports you to many countries around the world or there is a la carte choice also. Dubai is an expensive city to visit and meals everywhere cost! If you can't afford to stay there treat yourself to high tea as a visitor.","5","2014-03"
"Expensive to go for dinner we we would not go again.","We went for dinner as we had vouchers. We were staying at jumeriah beach hotel . One restaurant we booked wasn't avilable for visitors till 15 September. So we had to go for the Asian buffet 325 AED per  person  which there was lack of choice and not worth the money the restaurant itself was quiet and not the best experience we had. Lack of taste and we would not go again there. Hotel and some staff were friendly but jumeriah beach hotel more friendly and great vibe to the place .","3","2014-09"
"One&only Dinner","It's unequal dinner in my life and I hope to do again and again the stuff was very very helpful thanks to all of them.the food was very nice Fish and caviar, the seating was very comfortable and nice, we will try to do lunch very soon.","5","2014-09"
"Best ever!","Truly breathtaking from the airport transfer to the hotel to the last step out of the hotel.

Staff are so helpful.
Amazing decor inside and out. 
Room was VERY impressive!
Didn't want to leave!!

The amount of money spent on the hotel really shows the quality of it. 

Views are amazing too. 
View of the marina and sea view was so cool. 

TV entertainment was brilliant. 

Really enjoyed our stay. ","5","2014-07"
"Outstanding Hotel!!!","Hello!

Burj Al Arab is one of the greatest hotels in the world, everityhing inside is from another world, the lobby, the fountains, services, the staff is extremely polite, high quality of the food..I really enjoy my Afternoon Tea, it's an experience once in a life time, sa it definitely worth it! It's a must see for everyone how come and visit Dubai! A truly 7 star hotel!

Best regards, 

Bogdan Muncus.","5","2014-09"
"Above and beyond","This hotel is by far the greatest hotel, many times over. I have yet to experience better quality of amenities, or better customer service anywhere.  I also loved that they served bacon and pork sausage, unlike any other middle eastern hotels.  They will accommodate pretty much anything your heart desires.","5","2013-10"
"Fantastic stay with excellent service and amenities","I know a lot of things have been said about this hotel, but not enough on the actual accommodation.
For us it was a special stay for 3 days during late August - beginning of September in room 2004 (chosen as per our year when we got married) in order to celebrate our 10th anniversary, and my God they made it worth it!
I would like to thank Claudia and Ana-Maria from front desk concierge, then Alam, Vinicius, and Yvonna who were our ""butlers"" for the duration.
We were welcomed with the regular orange juice, fruits (sooo many), a bottle of branded Burj Al Arab red wine (replenished daily I'd like to add :)), and the amazing box with sweets.
Indeed the room layout and amenities are as per description, if not even more, but one piece of advice, don't look at too many photos before arrival because it's doesn't have the same novelty effect when you actually step in!
Their coffee machine has been changed recently to a gold one branded again Burj, but if you'd like the gold Ipad you have to request it upon check-in which we found out on leave, not a big deal though because you have computers over computers everywhere and on every single remote there's a Do Not Disturb button!
We had a choice of breakfast in the room, but we went to the restaurant where one can request anything of the menu!
During one of the dinners, in Bab Al Ywan if I remember correctly (the Asian one) the head chef came out to our table and then prepared a special dish to our preferences although the restaurant was buffet (also, everywhere we went I was handed a red rose and a huge bouquet along with a cake were waiting in the room as well!).
On a constructive note, we were missing a bath loofah and when requested we received 2 from the nearby Jumeirah Beach hotel, but then I also required some body lotion for my husband as there was only the feminine Hermes one; they brought me another Kelly Hermes one saying they don't have any! I believe this is one thing to look into because men do moisturize as well! And when in Jumeirah in Maldives we were given some cream from their spa..
To finalise in a positive and grateful note, Yvonne done the check in for us for the flights, and I strongly believe that because of this, when Emirates staff saw the envelope with the papers from Burj must've been having some sort of effect as we were upgraded to business class complimentary on the spot! Such a fantastic way to finish it all in style:)!
Looking forward to our next visit this time with our twins!","5","2014-08"
"Out of this world","We had a bit of a problem at check in that put a huge downer on the stay. I booked a reduced travel industry rate and was told by reservations that a payslip was valid ID for checking in, however when we checked in we were told we needed a travel industry ID card (not supplied to travel agents in the uk). We were asked to pay an extra £700 or check out. I did advise at the time of booking that I only had a payslip which detailed my name and company name etc and was told this was ok so to be told otherwise at check in was a real let down. We were left in the suite for almost 2 hours until they sorted it out and allowed us to stay on the reduced rate, not really the service to be expected at a 7 star hotel. After that though everything was amazing,from the ice buckets with water and face spray at the pool to the little presents left in the room. Service could not be faulted at all and we were treated like royalty! The full sized hermes products in the bathroom were a real treat, every time I smell it it will remind me of our amazing night at the hotel and to top it off my boyfriend proposed!!","4","2014-08"
"Drinks at the Sky Bar","I am reviewing our time spent at the Sky Bar as we did not stay at the hotel... That being said, felt like royalty when we arrived the staff was very welcoming. Once we arrived at the bar, they delivered snacks and we ordered our drinks. There is a requirement on how much you have to spend per person, not exactly sure of the price anymore but it is rather pricey. But how many times are we going to be in Dubai as a family? Not many, so it was worth it! 
The views off the bar are amazing and the drinks menu is extensive. 7 of us ordered different drinks each time and would share. It was a great time spent as family.","4","2014-07"
"Fabulous stay once again!! 🌟","Myself & my husband stayed for a week during Ramadan.   We have stayed here many times, normally 3 weeks at a time.  I booked direct with the hotel as this is beneficial to me being a gold card Sirius member.   We stayed in a panoramic suite on the half board deal.  We had an amazing time & the staff were once again on hand to cater for our every need.  Special mention to all the  pool guys at Bab al yam, who looked after us so well during the hot days at the pool & to all the butlers that looked after us (jess & Gary.)  The house keeping guys are often over looked,, they are truly amazing & kept our suite immaculate!!  Special mention to Nimal Joseph who handled & organised our stay so well.  Thank you & see you all very soon.  ","5","2014-09"
"7 star ? It smelt like a sewer !","You'll notice that many of the ""excellent"" reviews come from people who dined at the hotel rather than people who stayed there. And in this regard, given its architecture, I can understand people being wowed.
But having stayed there, I can assure you there are much better hotels in Dubai at half the price.   
1)	Service/Smell. Our floor smelt like a sewer main had broken. I reported it to the hotel at 6 am. When we checked out by noon it still smelt that way. A junior manager came to apologize but also had no idea what had happened.  they  weren’t exactly all over the problem. 
So maybe we were unlucky but read on….
2)	Security
They obsess about stopping people from dropping by just to take a look at the hotel. As a result, your id is checked every time you enter the hotel. As the guards have limited English and as it appear to be a paper/manual process, checking you out  takes about 5 minutes. This happens every time you return to the hotel and it gets old after awhile.  At true 5 star establishments, the staff learn the name of,  and  recognize the face of their  guests. At this one, you’ll be spelling your name slowly 3 or 4 times as they try to search thru their log to find you. 

3)	Doorman 
Once you get thru security you contend with the chaos of the one way  traffic circle. Its true third world style, there is no organization and cars are abandoned evey where.  it  take another 5 minute to get thru the last 50 feet. 

If an extra  5- 10 minutes doesn’t seem to bad, let me remind you that the temperature there is often 110-120 Fahrenheit. Believe me, it grows old. 

4)	Rooms. Big and gaudy (think Vegas suites). They were OK but nothing more than you’d expect for the price. Also, they are getting kind of old (built in the nineties)
. 
5)	Service/Butler. Not sure what these guys do other than watch you and make sure you don’t break any hotel rules and that  you are kicked out by check out time.  I only had a single special request and they could not do it. You get better service from a concierge at a normal hotel. 
6)	Kids Club.   It’s a joke. Literally smaller than your guest room. No organized activities. No interaction with the kids. 

I was sent a survey and dutifully filled it in. got a form response about “sorry you’re not happy” but nothing personal, nothing else. 
When we were there the occupancy seemed low. i cant imagine they get many return guests and given the cost of running a water front building, this explains the extremely high rates. they need to squeeze everyone they do get. 

So go see the building . its worht seeing. I’d recommend making a reservation for lunch and checking the place out. BUT DON’T STAY THERE. Take your hard earned cash and get a suite at the Ritz Carlton. There you will get 5 star service and a better experience for far less.","2","2014-08"
"Excellent Afternoon Tea","This was a very pleasant experience. You HAVE to have a reservation but this is easy to do by email. You cannot get past security without proof of the booking.

The entrance to the hotel is very impressive and all that glitters IS gold here. You go to the rear of the atrium to take the high speed lift to the Skyview Bar. All the staff are very attentive, courteous and friendly. Tea includes a glass of champagne, canapés, a selection of very tasty sandwiches and a tray of scones and pastries. There is even a crėme brûlée made with camel milk. Coffee and tea is unlimited and there are many varieties. You finish with a sorbet and a selection of chocolates. You do not feel rushed at the end and the staff are happy to take photos for you. The washrooms are lovely, as you would expect.

It is comparable wit the Ritz and other similar venues. At £85 per person it is good value.","5","2014-01"
"good vacation","hi.i am from iran.the hotel is very luxurious hotel.very nice and very great pool and beach.the room is guite and wonderful.very nice room and good service.we stayed one night in the september.breakfast was very good.","5","2014-09"
"Afternoon Tea Sensation!!!!","The most amazing and spectacular afternoon tea experience ever!!! The hotel is one of the most luxurious and opulent hotels in the world, the team who served tea were dressed in stunning uniforms and absolutely the most professional and attentive.  A beautiful harpist playing in the background. Champagne served to perfection, the afternoon tea the very best we have ever tasted..... 7 courses of delightful, mouthwatering taste sensations, a very special way to celebrate a very special year, birthday cake, red roses for the ladies...... Would highly recommend -thank you","5","2014-09"
"Truly 7 star.","Burj al arab is truly a 7 star hotel. It is a must if you're visiting Dubai, even just going for afternoon tea (which is wonderful) is a great idea. As a hotel it's just unbeatable. The rooms are so luxurious and elegant you feel like royalty, the pools are great fun and the beach is nice too. With so many restaurants you'll never run out of things to do. If you have the money to spend, not coming here would be a big mistake.","5","2014-09"
"OMG","Burj al Arab, is exactly what you would expect a wonderful hotel, interior is wow, the welcoming to the hotel was brilliant, the room what can I say it was wonderful, a lot bigger than I thought, we had booked a one bedroom suite. The room is quite colourful, but it all kind of goes.  The bedroom was huge! The bathroom was fabulous with a jacuzzi, all the toiletries were Hermes. The hotel as you can imagine has it's own private pool and beach area, buggies take you to and from. The hotel also has free access to the water park (wild wadi) which is fun even if you aren't or haven't got kids with you. We never got round to trying the restaurants but had in room dining, which has a big range of cuisines to choose from. The hotel and rooms in general are very clean. The staff are extremely friendly. There is a reception area on each floor, the receptionist always remembers your name and which room you are in and as they see you coming from the lifts they have your door open ready for you. I very much enjoyed my stay here, expensive yes but definitely worth it.","5","2014-06"
"One of the most high - end hotels in the world","The Burj Al Arab which is a symbol of Dubai for the last years is definetely one of the most high-end hotels in the world. It might not correspond to everyone's taste ( personally for me it's too much gold), but it's cool for sure. The luxury is in every corner of it: the service, the grounds, the shops.
We were staying at Jumeirah Beach Hotel , which is the neighbouring one and which belongs to the same chain. However we went to Burj Al Arab for an afternoon tea, which was great. Make sure not to have lunch before, since you will be served even the real food during the afternoon tea ceremony.
Due to the fact that our friends were staying at this hotel, we managed to see the pool area too: impressive, however the lack is that due to the rocks there is no real beach by Burj, but again in case you are staying at Burj, you can use the beaches of Jumeirah Beach Hotel which are great and have the scenic view on Burj Al Arab.","5","2013-11"
"Rolls Royce Experience","During the short stopover before flying to far east i enjoyed 2 days the Burj Al Arab.  First of all the enjoyable ride in the rolls royce but also mainly the great conversation with the driver as well that showed me Dubai in a nutshell was great. The Top-floor restaurant is great (wine and music and food are excellent BUT sometimes the windows are dirty because of the wind that blows sand against it. Downstairs you have several other restaurants and on 18th floor the gym is very professional with personal trainers. Totally downstairs is an exclusive swimming pool outside and very quiet sun chairs as only hotel quest are able to stay there. The rooms are full of luxury and give you that special feeling of being treated like a real quest.. a true complete Rolls Royce Experience ...","5","2014-03"
"THE BEST OF THE BEST","me, my wife and two children (8 and 11 yrs) really enjoyed a lot at this exclusive hotel because in has fun for every one at a high level. They make you feel like the king of the universe and im tot exagerating. We´ll be back sometime, thas´s for sure.","5","2014-08"
"Champagne Afternoon Tea","I took my wife for Champagne afternoon tea for her birthday. What can I say, the hotel is stunning and the staff were excellent.

We had the seven course afternoon tea with Champagne and the selection was great. Just after our final course the manager brought my wife a little birthday cake and the harpist played happy birthday.","5","2014-02"
"an unique experience","It is an experience of a life time. We decided to spend our wedding anniversary there and it was unforgettable. We choose the panoramic suite. It´s a suite with a magnificent view and luxuriously decorated. Each floor has a butler to attend to all your needs. The spa and restaurants are excellent. It's overpriced but, as I said, it is an experience of a life time..","5","2013-12"
"well spent afternoon","my wife and I had high tea at the top level restaurant, 
as you cannot get into the hotel to ""have a look ""(because of security and boom gate) this was a way to explore and eat.
  all types of finger food are offered from savory to sweet ,we were fortunate to have a  window seat overlooking old Dubai and marina,service was impeccable ,all food and drinks are included in fee ,with the exception of alcohol ,a complementary glass is given on arrival at table
Hearing of our anniversary,a beautifully presented cake was brought out,
It would be impossible to ask for any better service ,if you are in Dubai for a few days its well worth the visit.","4","2014-08"
"Amazing dining experience!","We visited the Burj Al Arab to experience the culinary flight. 
The booking process was a simple email to the hotel and they returned my email very quickly. 
From the moment you walk in you realise how special this hotel is - from the fancy cars parked out front to the fountains and fish tanks as you walk in. 
We did have a little trouble figuring out where to go but we were helped fairly quickly. 
We sat for a few minutes waiting for the lift to take us up to the skyview bar to start our experience, once in the lift I was left a little giddy looking out the glass lift to the sea below but I'm terrified of heights so no surprise there. 
We enjoyed our welcome cocktail and some nibbles while soaking in the incredible view. I wish we'd had a chance to see it in the daytime (maybe next time we will do the afternoon tea)
We continued on through the restaurant each time being greeted pleasantly and most staff members wished us a happy anniversary (our reason for visiting Dubai) 
The food was phenomenal, I just wish I hadn't indulged in the bread each time it was provided. 
The night ended with a delicious dessert. They gave me a rose and a cake for both of us to celebrate our special occasion. Thankfully they offered to box the cake up so we could take it with us as there was certainly no room left in our bellies! 
Overall the night was one of my all time favourite experiences, yes it is expensive but totally worth it. It is a great way to experience a lot of what the hotel has to offer. 
The only sour note of the experience was in Junsui, there was another restaurant patron speaking extremely loudly in his mobile phone this must have gone on at least 20 mins, he was that disruptive that a couple on a table near his asked to be moved. I would have appreciated if the manager of the restaurant had spoken to this gentleman especially considering on my booking confirmation it expressly asked for phones to be switched to silent so as not to disturb other guests. 
Definitely recommend the culinary flight to anyone who wants a unique restaurant experience in an opulent setting.","5","2014-08"
"Out of this world","What an unbelievable experience, from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave the staff can't do enough to make your stay spectacular.  We had a two bedroom suite which was mind blowing.
Yes, this is not a cheap hotel but I must say its worth every single penny, the rooms were amazing and the food was fabulous, not to mention the service!!! 
We ate in the restaurants and the food and service at all times was as you would expect from this fine establishment.  We'd eaten here many times before and I was worried that staying here would be a bit 'posh' in fact, I couldn't have been more wrong, I found the way the staff treated us was really discreet, professional and non intrusive.  Can't wait to go back, once again, worth every penny!","5","2014-08"
"Curious","Great hotel but very overpriced any other five star in Dubai will do just as well they overwhelm you with attention the rooms are very spacious very good if you are in need of constant attention the seafood restaurant is excellent","5","2014-08"
"Lives up to its 7 star rating!","This hotel is amazing!!!! It never fails to deliver and maintains its service and accommodation to the highest standard. We love it! The restaurants junsui and bab al yams are simply exceptional with phenomenal service and attention throughout your stay. This is the best place to stay if you want a care free relaxing holiday! It's simply the best! ","5","2014-08"
"Burj al Arab","Came here for my 50th birthday. From the moment we were picked up from the airport to the minute we departed from the hotel we were treated like royalty. The standard of the suites is excellent. The butler service wonderful. Our son has Downs Syndrome and we wondered how we would get on in such a luxurious place. The attitude of staff towards him was so attentive and caring without being patronising and they gave him a birthday surprise that must have been planned with military precision (his birthday was going to be 2days after we had departed) and they knew it was his birthday even though we had never mentioned it. The food in the restaurants is of such a high standard and utterly delicious. Wonderful hotel,fabulous staff-can't wait to go back.","5","2014-08"
"Innovative and Meaningful Structure","Since its physical appearance is what draws everyone's attention, the architect of the building and the architect of the ''Meaning"" are to be highly commended. The sail of a ship it truly is...it truly is remarkably beautiful.

The staff/ team that make up the inside of the sail are extraordinarily helpful and pleasant. They are always anticipatory to your needs. Our 2 night stay was wonderful. Our suite was opulent and unlike any room we have ever stayed in. It was true luxury to us.

But what we observed is that luxury is ""serious business"" and all the beautiful smiles and gestures  are part of that seriousness. For us, there is no fun in  seriousness. We discovered that concept when we took a buggy to their neighboring property...not a 7 star hotel, but lots of fun.

Thank you to the ladies and gentlemen of Burj Al Arab for making our stay luxurious!","5","2014-08"
"Can't be beaten","We have stayed lots of times, it is a bit expensive I knows but always good. The staff are very kind and good with kids, the rooms are mostly quiet (avoid studios at the front) and well appointed.  They have got tighter over the years with free after shave!","5","2014-04"
"The most beautiful of buildings","Had afternoon tea at the Burj during a short stopover. This is a hotel that you simply must visit at least once when you are in Dubai - it is quite extraordinary.

You cannot just rock up and expect to wander about the hotel - you need to have a reservation for either a room or afternoon tea to get through security.

The food was mouth-watering and plentiful, the staff were welcoming and treated you as a special guest but it is the building itself that is the standout.

Elegant on the outside and dazzling on the inside - I lost count of the number of times I said 'Wow!'

Treat yourself to a once in a lifetime visit - you will not be disappointed!","5","2014-08"
"Utterly incredible!!","Stayed for a quick stopover on my way to Singapore. I have stayed in lots of hotels in Dubai and this has always been on my bucket list. Staying in hotels like the Madinat Jumierah I saw the towering architectural masterpiece whilst pacing around the resort. Don't get me wrong, the vast majority of luxury hotels in dubai are of a high standard but this is on another level. In my opinion one of the most important parts of a hotel stay is a good first impression. When walking into the lobby I was both startled and disgusted by the amount of gold and jewels. Seriously, picture the most lavish, opulent image and you will get the Burj al Arab lobby. Needless to say, my stay was amazing from the beginning to the end. The opulence doesn't stop in the lobby (like some Dubai hotels) it is present everywhere. Now this hotel is the most luxurious, lavish and ridiculously hotel I have ever had the experience of staying in. My stay was great and it goes without saying that the service was of a high standard and the food was insane, if a little expensive, but hey your in the worlds only 7 star hotel. So overall the hotel is worthy of its really high price tag but you have to realise that the cost doesn't end there. I would defiantly return if I had the opportunity, but I think my next visit to Dubai will be in a much more down to earth less expensive hotel. Thank you to the Burj al Arab staff and Jumierah for an unforgettable stay","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon tea: the experience","I went to this hotel for its afternoon tea which consisted of 5 to 7 courses of small bite size pieces of luxury. Starting with a local plum champagne and proceeding through a traditional english menu of micro-pastries and tasty treats.

My cappuccino had gold sprinkled on the foam which added to the surreal nature of the whole experience. The building itself is like Dubai - crazy, ornate, over the top and slightly nauseating.

Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody visiting, it's an experience!","5","2014-01"
"Afternoon tea","When we booked afternoon tea we thought it seemed very expensive but it turned out to be our favourite experience of the whole holiday.  From the minute you arrive at the door you are made to feel special.  The door men are extremely welcoming and friendly.    We arrived a little early so had a look around the shops - everything is gleaming.  When we got to the Sky Bar we were speechless,  the view was amazing.  We were sat by the window overlooking the marina.  We were offered champagne or champagne cocktail of our choice.  We had a Kir Royal.  each course was divine and we were encouraged to try as many teas and coffees as we liked.  it was our anniversary and the waiter kindly presented us with a little cake saying 'Happy Anniversary"" and a beautiful red rose.    GREAT VALUE fOR MONEY - do it, you won't regret it!","5","2014-08"
"Not worth the money","If you can look beyond the awful colours the hotel is very nice. Rooms are great and the views are good. Service is ok but the staff aren't as knowledgable about the hotel services as they should be so don't rely on what you're told. 
The butler service is a con. It's meant to be complementary but what you would expect a butler to do as part of their job is all chargeable, eg ironing shirts and the morning news paper...
On the whole an interesting experience and glad I've stayed but really not worth the money. ","4","2014-08"
"Afternoon Tea was fantastic","Went with friends for afternoon tea (with champagne, of course!) to celebrate a birthday with an ex-pat living in Dubai, so no need to experience the rooms at the Hotel, so can not comment on them! From the moment of arrival everything was top class, the security - yes there is some good security before you cross the bridge to the actual Hotel, the welcome at the main entrance and once inside to the first floor. Very colourful and the architecture, colours, bright and bold and internal the layout unexpected. The afternoon tea at 510 dhms (£85) which sounds expensive but was a treat was special - 7 courses of little finger food including a slice of beef, with a glass of champagne (and tea!) was superb, In fact, by the end we were all so full we didn't even bother with an evening meal that night. We were there for a good few hours. Harpist played during tea. The service was excellent and the staff smart friendly and discreet. The hotel was top notch and for those fortunate to actually stay there they  have their well protected private areas where residents only can go, which is to be expected and stop riff raff like me having a nose about. The residents only areas are very private, so I can not comment on the outdoor facilities, the rooms or the restaurants but on the experience of afternoon tea they will be superb. Pre book the afternoon tea, you can not just turn up. You will not be disappointed. I was in awe of the place.","5","2014-08"
"Simply Amazing Experience","My husband booked the Burj Al Arab for my birthday and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had the most amazing experience.  We had a fantastic suite on level 24 with wonderful views across to the Burj Khalifa.  The suites are incredible, every need is catered for and all the staff are so lovely and attentive, always using your name, they cannot do enough for you but never in your way, they discreetly allow you to enjoy the wonderful experience of staying in this unique hotel. The Hermes toiletries are really nice and if you have time, you can choose from the vast jacuzzi menu which your butler will prepare for you. The hotel arranged a lovely birthday surprise in our suite which I will not share in detail as I would not want to spoil the surprise for others. We recommend having breakfast in your suite, plenty of choice and delicious. The Skyview bar is a lovely way to end the evening with wonderful views across Dubai and the spa is well worth a visit, we both enjoyed relaxing treatments that we would have again.  You have the option of chilling out by the pool or going to the beach, we tried and enjoyed both. We were never sure whether we would really feel the value for what is one of the more expensive hotels but it was worth every penny and we will return to enjoy again.  A memorable birthday treat.  Thank you team for a great experience.","5","2014-08"
"Treat","We visited the burj 9/8/14 a treat for my husbands 50th! From approaching the entrance we where made to feel very special. We had the aberdeen angus burgers amazing! A couple of drinks and just took in the view from the 27th floor, the restaurant staff where fab and my hubby got a birthday cake. Yes its not a cheap night out but for special occasions it is a must whilst in Dubia,! Massive thankyou to all the staff.","5","2014-08"
"Blew our socks off","Absolutely fantastic from the Rolls  Royce chauffeur pick up at airport right through to fillet steak for breakfast been here 3 times now 
This place is truly amazing we stopped in the the two storey suites spacious and fantastic the staff. Are all fantastic all knew your name soon as they saw you welcomed you and the children so welcoming pure  luxury didn't think it could get any better until we booked again and this time was upgraded to presidential suite ....... Truly blew our  socks off  two out side walls of glass and snooker table in games room and full kitchen in fact it was like a house best time  to go for the weather and be able to do things we've found is February and October and Christmas this time we've been and seen so much more development to do in Dubai now it truly is so cosmopolitan and by far our fabbest place to go","5","2014-02"
"I have stayein hotels around the world - but NOTHING like this","What did we like about this hotel? 100% All of it!

Every single member of staff were courteous, extremely well trained and genuinely were happy and willing to help.

The rooms were 'lavish' to say the least as all Duplex Apartments were fully stocked with every conceivable amenity - from computer/printer, complimentary bottle of wine, all Hermes toiletries, superb coffee machine and the latest high-tech remote/electronic suite-management system.

The location is halfway between JBL and Dubai Mall, easy to get to and I would urge anyone that has had what they consider to be the greatest hotel experience of their lives, to try the Burj (if only for one night) and then to reassess which is the best hospitality experience.

Simply in awe of the hotel and the benchmark it has now set in our own minds!

There is not a single negative comment I could make about this hotel and our stay there.","5","2014-08"
"Honeymoon Perfection","We spent our last 2 nights of our amazing honeymoon in the opulence of the Burj Al Arab.
We had an airport transfer in a white Rolls Royce to the hotel at 6am and were given our hotel room immediately. Upon check in we were taken to our 2 level panoramic suite with grand staircase and possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever laid upon.
We dined in our room both nights and were given the most decadent and delicious chocolate cake from hotel management to celebrate our wedding.
Fresh flowers were everywhere throughout the hotel room and were replenished daily.
The staff went above and beyond to assist us and make sure our stay was unforgettable.
The hotel has it all and more, highly recommend to anyone wanting to celebrate something special with a loved one.","5","2014-07"

"Skyview afternoon tea","Food and service was great . Disappointing that it was extremely hazy so couldn't see out very far . My main issue was that our reservation stated we where in the Sahneddar area this is the 1st  floor lobby not the Skyview restaurant area . It was only after l complained to the manager that we were moved up to the Skyview area .  But after we were up it was one of the best experiences we have had in our travels . Staff were happy to take some photos of us in the restaurant .","5","2014-08"
"Wow what a hotel and excellent experience","The hotel was amazing! Two storey large suite with sweeping views of the water and city. We had our own butler who were very helpful.  The Asian restaurant was excellent for breakfast. Don't bother swimming in the ocean it's too hot. The pool is better. Overall an excellent experience.","5","2014-07"
"High Tea at Skyview Bar, Burj Al Arab","My husband and I were travelling in July/August 2014 but I booked for afternoon tea in the Skyview Bar in November 2013 as I'd been told it was a magical experience if you get the opportunity. We were on a stopover in Dubai with another couple after a wonderful European holiday and this was a superb way to end our trip. We were met by the lovely ladies in blue and gold at the entrance to the Burj Al Arab Hotel and the foyer itself is magnificent. Aquariums on either side and a golden atrium that goes up and up. We were directed to the panoramic lift, then all the way to the 27th floor with magnificent views over the sea. Once again we were met by lovely ladies that made you feel that this was going to be a very special experience. We were directed to our table by the window and our waiter introduced himself. His service was excellent and as we progressed our way through the delicious afternoon tea he was very attentive. Just the pouring of the champagne was a sight to behold. We arrived at 4 and were not rushed at all, leaving about 7pm after watching the sun go down over the sea. A fabulous experience I highly recommend. ","5","2014-08"
"6 star hotel but 1 star food experience","We attended Iftar (breaking of the fast) at the Falak Ballroom in Burj Al Arab on July 23rd this year. Whilst the hotel was amazing and service was ver good unfortunately the food was substandard and inline with what I would expect from a road side cafe rather than a 6 star hotel. The starters were cold, the mains were average and the deserts were stale. It was almost like they'd been prepared a day in advance and been left out in the sun. The qatayef were extremely dry and the Oum Ali was the worst I had during our 16 days in Dubai. Given Iftar here was almost double the price of Asateer at Atlantis, I would wholeheartedly recommend Asateer over the experience at Falak in Burj Al Arab","1","2014-07"
"Excellent afternoon tea","My husband and I visited here on our honeymoon.

It was fairly expensive (I think £80 approx. pp) but we feel this provided good value for money. Firstly, it allowed you to gain access to the hotel which is otherwise under lock-and-key and you can only enter if you are staying at the hotel or have reservations.

Upon arrival, the hotel is beautiful, very elegant and exciting to visit. Out afternoon tea was booked in the sky bar and we travelled up through the hotel to reach the summit of the hotel. The views are amazing, you can either sit facing out to sea and the palm or you can choose views over Dubai. We sat overlooking the sea as the sun would later be setting in that direction.

The setting itself is breath taking as the whole sky bar is glass which provides amazing views from every angle. There was also a pianist when we visited which provided some lovely background music.

We were greeted by friendly and helpful staff and the selection of foods were delicious. We had a small starter and we were offered dates and a small selection of other nibbles. We then had sandwiches. These were mouth watering but please don't make the same mistake as us and order another round of sandwiches. I believe my 7lb weight gain from our honeymoon came from this afternoon tea visit! The food was so moreish and plenty was available, had I realised more and more would arrive at the table, we wouldn't have taken the extra sandwiches.

We were then provided with pastries and scones, the usual suspects of an afternoon tea and this was served on a Burj shaped tea stand which looked great. A huge choice of teas and more food than you could possibly want! We were given a rose when leaving and more chocolates. A really great experience, not to be missed.","5","2013-10"
"Afternoon tea - UK traveller","Our first visit to Dubai and we were celebrating a big birthday so booked for afternoon tea at Skyview bar. Didn't really get the expected greeting at the hotel lobby and after asking two staff members where we should go, we were just told to go up the escalator. So abit disappointing upon arrival. Excellent views as you would expect and the service outstanding. 
The event lasts about 2 hours and was an experience in itself. ","5","2014-08"
"Ultimate afternoon tea","My husband booked the ultimate afternoon tea as a birthday present for me and a wedding anniversary celebration for us  The service  from the time we arrived at the entrance until we left was exemplary The spectacular aquarium which accompanies the escalators up and down to the first floor are beautiful and a great feature. The champagne was served and the food service began commencing with berries tart finger sandwiches carvery of delicious beef and very creamy mashed potato kiwi sorbet scones fresh pastries Hot beverages of your choice served when requested The staff provided a birthday cake and a red rose to us Overall a wonderful experience and the staff excelled themselves","5","2014-08"
"BURJ AL ARAB - TEA","I have travelled extensively and seen some beautiful places, but the experience that I had at the Burj Arab was by far the most oppulent one in every way, from service, food, friendliness, professionalism to the magnificent views.  I was celebrating a BIG birthday and they exceeded my expectations in every way and even surprised me with a miniature birthday cake and a rose.  I highly recommend it.","5","2014-07"
"Celebrated my Husband's Birthday at Al Muntaha Restaurant","It was a wonderful experience at Al Muntaha the top of Burj Al Arab. We celebrated my husband's birthday.  He was treated like a king. He was so happy. The atmosphere was very good, the view was fantastic. The food was superb. I specially want to mention about the service. The staff is very professional and takes good care. One should definately try this place.","5","2014-08"
"Is it really worth 7 stars?","We spent the last 2 nights of our holiday at the Burj. Obviously being rated 7 stars we had very high expectations which on reflection were not all met.
Arrival was amazing and very welcoming and we were immediately led to our suite which was splendid, huge and absolutely beautiful. Our butler showed us round and informed us that he was going to look after us for the next two days. We were really impressed and thought that we were going to be totally spoiled. Disappointed though that there was no mention of the gold ipad which the website promises.
The  first day was super and we enjoyed the pampering. Little things like when we returned to our suite, the butler jumped up, opened the door for us and escorted us into our suite, made us feel special.
Things changed the following day though. It was a different butler on duty and he certainly did not try and make us feel special or infact make an  effort to get up from his chair. This butler was more like a caretaker who said hello to you as you went past. He did absolutely nothing for us. We asked about a restaurant reservation but he informed us that as we were going to a buffet then we could just walk in. (When we did this, we were made to feel that this was strange practice and should have booked via our butler)  
On the first day, I had asked the butler to cut a pineapple for me. When he brought it to me, he said that he had requested it again for the following day at the same time.. 4.30pm. He also brought us muffins which he said were part of our package. On the second day, no muffins were offered and my pineapple was delivered at 10pm. 
We had made coffee in the afternoon and found the dirty cups still sitting there at night time. Also in the first night we had wine in the bedroom and believe it or not the dirty glasses were still sitting there when we left 2 days later?
We found the room too hot and altered the A/C to 18. We informed the butler of this on our first day. However,  the second night we couldn't sleep due to the heat in the room and discovered that the house keeping staff had turned it back up to 22.
We had better service and were better looked after in Jumeirah Beach hotel.
The pool bar was another disappointment. Very run down and uninviting. It was unmanned for most of the time and the staff tried to get you to have drinks on the sunbeds rather than use the swim up bar.
Buffet breakfast was ok but did not compare with Jumeriah Beach or Al Qsar. We had breakfast in our suite on the second morning which was excellent. Once again though, no input from our  butler.
Overall, hotel staff were lovely and very polite and friendly. On check out we were escorted by a manager which was a nice touch.
Yes, we enjoyed the experience and had a lovely two days. 
Yes, the suite was beautiful and very luxurious.
No, it wasn't worth the money and the butler service was a disappointment.
wIll we go back? ...probably not!","3","2014-08"
"WoW ,","Just perfect , 7 star hotel , this place is a once in a lifetime have to go if you have the cash , had 2 nights as a special treat for my wife as it was our anniversary .
the food ,,, well all I can say we had the half board summer special , the breakfast was quite simply the best I have ever had I think .
the dinner was just perfect ,,,
The place is a dream come true","5","2014-07"
"Burj Al Arab - Junsui Restaurant","Went for breakfast buffet with my 10 year old daughter. What is there to say except that the food was excellent, along with the service. My daughter was treated like a princess. I highly recommend it, if you haven't been you must try it at least once. Be careful, its hard to step down after you have been to a place like this.","5","2014-07"
"What an experience","We wanted to see inside this hotel but unfortunately you have to make a reservation. We decided to book the sky view bar with a minimum spend per person of 320 UED around £50. We booked the table for 9.00pm by email 48 hours before arriving in Dubai. The whole experience was very special and we did get a window seat for our party. Would definitely recommend this experience as we were treated like royalty throughout our stay.","5","2014-08"
"Friday buffet - not to be missed","Our family of 4 has just returned from Dubai (2 weeks holiday), we booked the Friday buffet at the Burj Al Arab and I must say it was fantastic not to be missed. Food choice and service was first class. View from the 27th floor was spectacular. Not cheap but value for money certainly.","5","2014-08"
"COMING BACK FOR MORE","In my  vacation a year ago , I included Dubai as  the last stop after Paris, French Riviera and Moscow.
It was the smart thing to do, but even better was to choose the ""BURJ AL ARAB ""as my hotel ,,,or better  said,  palace in Dubai  
Going in my trips to dozens and  dozens of cities in more than twenty Countries around the world I can tell you ""this is the one and a only one "" seven star in the world.
the readiness of the stuff to help you is  so impressive, that at times you don`t know what you needed till they tell you
   About service ?? let me tell you just one event:  ""MY RETURNING LOUNDRY WAS SO CLEANED  AND PERFECTLY IRONED, THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT MINE"".

The view  from the 16 floor to the north (downtown) is so great and inviting to enjoy,, that I have to get a helicopter ride and take a closer look.
WATER IS YOUR POINT?? ,,,just go over across the bridge and make no more plans for the day .
Ground transportation ? right at the door; from limos all the way to buses, The former is a real treat, it will tour you the way you wish, if wanted, at the mall, restaurant, disco or anywhere they   will wait for you , 
RESTAURANTS?  every taste is there, just one thing at Al Mahara  don`t ask to fry  the big fish in the aquarium it is their mascot ( forgot its name).
I`m enjoying talking all thing  about Dubai and  this paradise , but instead , in a few weeks I`ll be heading that  way . again.","5","2013-09"
"Absolutely incredible","It's hard to imagine how you can top a regular 5 star hotel, but the Burj Al Arab manages it. From the duplex suite, the faultess service and the extra special touches, this hotel is incredible. As you would expect, the suite is huge, great views over the palm and the Marina district. Private butler on hand to help however you need. The swimming pool was great (you get your own cool box with iced water and occasionally someone comes around to offer you complementary popcorn or shooters of juice) and the swim up bar is fun. The private beach can be accessed by buggy from the hotel entrance and again, excellent service with towels and iced water. The 18th floor gym was much bigger than expected and a good range of machines. We were celebrating a special occasion and the hotel went out of its way to help us celebrate. Although it's far more than you would ever sensibly spend on a hotel, it was well worth! All-in-all, faultless.","5","2014-08"
"Very good but something's off","Spent one night here on our way to Tanzania. An overly luxurious beautiful hotel that had seen better days. We had a nice stay in our suite which was more like a 2 storey luxury apartment. Mattress was a little hard but we were too tired from the long flight that it didn't bother us too much. Enjoyed the nice shower heads and large soaking tub. Every amenities were provided, but something felt off with this place. 
Came with high expectations as it's the world's first 7 stars hotel. A cheap looking US$5 mini garbage can in the marbled bathroom with a flip top that doesn't work? It's an eyesore amongst the golds and marbles that were generously plastered around the place. All of the staff that we encountered at check in, concierge, butler, room service, bell boy, pool, restaurant and managers came from around the world and spoke English well enough. They were courteous, polite and doing their best to please but somehow, it felt practiced and at times, unnatural. We were loaned a gold Ipad that was not useable as it came with low power and its charger did not work. The international buffet was alright with typical continental breakfast items and a few Asian choices thrown in that just didn't go together at all. Ordered pastas for room service- turned out better than the buffet. Overall, a good place to rest for one night and for the ""been there, done there"" experience.","4","2014-07"
"The hotel that taste forgot!","If you like your TV clad in gold (presumably to remind you how rich you are!) then this is the place for you! Joking (and gold, yes pretty much everything is clad in it) aside, this will probably be the most opulent suite you will ever stay in and it will take your breath away. We stayed in a standard suite which came complete with a sweeping staircase, lounge with floor to ceiling windows, downstairs cloakroom, bedroom, dressing room and huge bathroom. I was particularly tickled by the mirror (gold clad) conveniently placed above the bed - interesting addition of furniture for an Arab country! The room provides everything you could want,full sized Hermes toiletries including perfume and aftershave, sun lotion, there really is nothing you will want for. It really is just a matter of taste and this hotel clearly is more suited to a middle eastern clientele than maybe a Northern European. The reason I have rated it as only very good is a combination of personal taste and low service standards. There is only one butler per floor and getting restaurant reservations or things organised was incredibly slow. One would expect much better service of a hotel of this standard. The restaurants were awfully busy and hard to get reservations in, it seemed that being a hotel guest with a child did not win you any favourable reservation, if one at all. In short an excellent business style hotel but overcrowded  and not to my taste.","4","2013-09"
"DO NOT WASTE TIME OR MONEY ON THE TEA IN THE LOUNGE","Was recommended to try the afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab…..but what a huge let down and what a huge bill!
Sounded like we were in for a treat 7 courses…an upgrade fee available to add a glass of champagne,,(or settle for the sparkling date juice in the regular option)…but for what we paid ..almost £180 (for 2 adults and a seven year old child)….the quality of the product fell far below the hype and expectation, The service was very good (i.e. staff attentive) and they sure knew to pour that sparkling date juice in a very fancy sommelier like manner…. but the bottom line they were serving up dry sandwiches, dry,tasteless cuts of roast beef with an incipid piped blob of mash potato- not even creamy or buttery,,,honestly tasted no different to a dollop of 'Smash' instant plato flakes and followed by far from luxurious patisseries. Having in both UK and Parisian hotels and michelin starred venues, even actually even in 4/5 stars around the world…I really cannot see a) why the hotel do not realise this (b) how they can justify the prices.
Seven stars of six…sorry not worth it at all, I actually feel robbed.  If you want nice food in Dubai the Fairmont on the Palm (owners of the Savoy) seem to do this effortlessly and for a quarter of the price but tasty tasty food…not an endless sugarfest of tasteless . So be warned. If you splash the cash…don't tell me that you weren't warned.","2","2014-08"
"Nothing bad but should be better.","First of all pardon my criticism and pickiness as I believe a Hotel that brands ITSELF as 7* should be perfect in all the senses. There are more expensive properties, but definitely not any property so proud to advertise its status so it needs to match it.

Impressive check-in/receiving as we get to hotel, as it is hassle free and straight to room. Escorted from car to Room as guard at gate indicated our arrival to staff at arrival area.

Room: Definitely Over-The-Top. Could not live in something like this but for a luxury hotel room it does the Job. 
Every detail is taken care of. View is amazing. 
No Ipod/Music docking station which seemed strange for such a high-tech room.
Web-Page promises an I-pad on arrival as a Permanent online concierge and this was not given/made available.
Great coffee machine but no coffee menu so we did not know what we're drinking. Butler did tell us each coffee at checking but how can we remember all. Need to have a coffee menu. Also drank coffee and milk sachets were replenished for next day but coffee consumed was not. There is a limit on the coffee?
We had our son so an extra bed was provided free of cost (under 12). Very good quality extra-bed.

Staff: 
Very helpful but their knowledge is limited to what they have been told and not much more. They lack street knowledge.
Room was very High-tech so we asked if they had a Docking station for an Ipod. No answer. I feel not because they were being un-polite but because they had no clue what we were talking about. 
Lot of staff had limited knowledge of English and difficult to communicate.

Raymond: Butler on our floor. Very good special commendation. Nothing special. He was just excellent all the way.

Generally staff were polite, but such a place maybe fewer trainees and more professional staff.

Wifi - Complimentary. Great. We sometimes see so many high-end hotels charging for Wifi and also limiting the devices, so it is refreshing to see this.

On the day of our sons birthday staff came into the room with a cake and one on the guitar to sign Happy Birthday. Great gesture and well done.

Restaurants:

Bab-Al-Yam
Nice poolside restaurant offering in and out door seating.
Had the lunch buffet, decent price for the venue. Not a large amount of selection but good quality. Simple and Good. 
Chefs at cooking counter were quick to adapt to requests and made a wonderful effort.
Table staff very polite with their “Yes”, ""Thank You”, “Sir” etc., but lack professionalism. We asked for 1/2 bottle of champagne and after 20 minutes gave up. They forgot, or something. If they ran out and went to get it from cellar, they should have informed of delay. We switched to a single glass of champagne and that was faster.
Buffet had Bef Wellington (English dish) and surprised not to see English mustard next to it. They had French, dijon and other but not English. Requested it, and after 20 minutes they bought some more French mustard (in small bottles clearly labelled). So obviously staff had no idea of what English mustard is. Surprise for a poolside restaurant that serves snacks such as burgers etc.

Al Mahara:
Same again very polite and respectful but slow in service (and restaurant was empty). Sophie was very accommodating and helped make a difference. Junior staff has no knowledge and they sometimes say yes without even understanding the question. Second Champagne glass took over 12 minutes to be served (yes I timed it).

Lobby Bar:
More of the same, all good smiles and good salutations but low knowledge of product and service.
Sat down and ordered some drinks. Ordered a light lunch. Kids pasta was Good. We ordered oysters followed by assorted dim sums. Dim Sums were according to staff made to order as we requested without shrimps. They came cold. A cold dim sum means they were dry and uneatable. They immediately offered to replace them. next batch just as bad. Chef came out to explain that they have to be hot if not they dry up and they can’t bring them out to lobby in steamers due to fire regulations and by the time they get to table and pass through all air-conditioning they get too cold. We suggested they remove them from menu.
Substituted for a Lamb Shawarma. It was good and well done, bit was not a Shawarma and more a minced meat sandwich. Lack of knowledge of a Shawarma in such a hotel in Dubai?

Common Areas:

Snooker Room: Went with my son to play snooker. Very nice room. Surprised to see the balls. Typical with time balls get lost. They had replaced missing balls with different balls. So you are playing with balls of different sizes and different colour tones. Would have been better to replace the whole set. Did not really matter to us as we were just practising, but could not play a game like that. For the Burj…. disappointing.

InDoor Pool: Great pool. Small but excellent views and setting.

In Room Dining:

Very good presentation and table set up.
Good quality of food. Good quantities.
Soup: Great presentation and taste. Soup bowls slightly shallow so difficult to eat, though they looked great. 
Soup delivered in large metal soup serving dishes. Basics physics and very frequent misconception. Metal is a good conductor. So it conducts the heat from the soup to the metal container and then out, loosing temperature inside the container and thus cooling the food (in this case the soup). A porcelain dish is a worse conductor so the heat does not move out and stays in. Great misconception about metal dishes. they are great to heat or maintain food hot if on top of a heat source as then it conducts the heat in. If not all the opposite (not a problem specific to this property).

Usual problem: food does not remain hot. Even in trolley in hot cupboard. This is because the cupboard was not pre-heated sufficiently or did not have a source of heat inside.

Second night In Room Dining:
Just as good a specious day. Sincerely out of all dining the In Room Dining was the best. Restaurants lacked professional staff (the minority knew what they were doing).

Eating venues impressive in look but not impressed with food.
Room Service and basic dishes were excellent. Seemed going back to 20 years ago when Hotel food was never considered to be great apart from the basics (soup, sandwich, burgers and ice creams).

Great hotel, great facilities, great smiles and willingness by staff, but the capacity of staff is limited. Its a shame.","4","2014-08"
"Luxurious Everywhere","Stayed here just for one night but must to say one of the most beautiful hotel ever. The location is just perfect, service exectly as it should be in this kind of hotel...Try room service or one of many nice restaurants over there! Looking forward to visit this luxury hotel again in the future.","5","2014-08"
"Fantastic Afternoon Tea......","Well my partner and I decided to experience afternoon tea at the sky view bar, which was lovely. We upgraded the champagne and for doing so received a lovely cashmere scarf which was very much unexpected. Further, due to our recent engagement they presented myself with a beautiful red rose and plenty of chocolates. The view was incredible, its a good place to really view the palm. The staff were friendly and very eager for you to enjoy yourself. Definitely worth I visit, possibly a little bit too pricey but still an enjoyable experience.","5","2014-08"
"Perfection has a price","If you need a stay at a hotel where everything needs to be perfect, I would refer the Burj Al Arab.  It was perfect for the whole family, my wife and I enjoyed ourselves while they had activities for our children.  I read a review about not vacationing during Ramadan, If you are a value tourist, I think that is the best time to go.  I stayed there for 1000usd a night.  During the high season, the same room would have been 4000usd.  I would also add that they give you a lot of freebies.  I estimated that they gave us around 500-700usd in freebies.  The toiletries items were Hermes……not cheap.  It is a real value during Ramadan.","5","2014-07"
"The most used word during our stay, Wow!!","This Hotel really is amazing. It was everything that we had read, and heard about, and more. The setting is fantastic, the suite and view from it, brilliant. The service, everything you would expect, from one of the best Hotels in the world. 
My only little gripe, was that we booked half board, expecting to be able to dine in one of the hotels world renown restaurants. But unfortunatly, where only allowed to have our meals in the Buffet breakfast bar. Nice as it was, with the price we paid(more for one night, than I have ever paid for a room for a week) we expected to dine in any of the Hotels restaurants.
But that aside, we had a fantastic stay. If you have the money, I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. If like me, you have to watch the pennies, I would recommend this hotel, as we did, for a once in a lifetime stay, for a special occasion.","5","2013-11"
"NO MARGIN FOR FAILURES","With those rates, it is simply unnaceptable that something doesn´t work, in our case the a/c and audio system, thex fix it the next day and gave us great attention, but you simply cant believe that something will not be ok in the consider best hotel of the world, I really suggest to avoid the Ramadan month, they serve you food on the fast hours but in a very unconfortable way, the property is amazing, the rooms decoration is a monument to opulence, and I think is a place that deserves a one in a lifetime stay.","4","2014-07"
"The Burj","The rooms are nice and ornate, the staff is excellent including the personal butlers.  The prices are high, but the views are spectacular.   The portions of food are small for what you pay and the pool is too small.   It does however have excellent security and one who desires safety, would appreciate the bridge that can seal off.","4","2014-04"
"Worth every penny","A truly fantastic experience -well worth the money. 

The hotel is everything you would expect from the worlds only 7 star hotel. From the outside the hotel structure is impressive. In the lobby the architecture and the ambience are as equally impressive. 

The journey to the Sky Bar is a via a very smooth but rapid lift with a great view. Upon arriving at the Sky bar you can experience the stellar views and the quality of the surroundings. We had a table with a spectacular view towards the Burj Khalifa. 

The staff lead you through the event explaining every step of what was a 7 course high tea. The team that looked after our party was excellent - very friendly. The food and beverages are of exceptional quality. The choice of beverages is comprehensive - the quantity of non alcoholic drinks is unlimited. 

We throughly enjoyed the whole experience finding it excellent value for money for what is a unique event. The food and drink was plentiful. The ladies were treated to a rose and chocolates during the visit -making them feel very special.

I would throughly recommend this experience if you are in Dubai.","5","2014-07"
"5th stay, will NEVER return! ","We have stayed at the burj 5 times over the past few years. Some stays have been excellent whilst others have been a little inconsistent (see previous reviews). 

Our stay previous to this was one of the best when we were personally looked after by the guest relations manager, sebastian fleig and ahmed ereiba. We were aware of the fact that sebastian had moved to another hotel but we had hoped that the same level of service would exist. We were so wrong!! 

We booked through a travel agent, we normally book direct and used our expiring sirius points for upgrades. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a panoramic suite which we were very grateful. However on this trip something was lacking.. We wasn't sure why. Whether it was due to the fact that all of the managers appeared to be on holidays? Because we booked through a travel agent? Or whether we were using our expiring sirius points? 

The main reason for visiting the burj is because you are made to feel special, the arrival is one of the highlights. Normally we are greeted by a manager, and a receiving line of Arabic coffee, cold flannels, incense and dates. We were only greeted by two ladies and only cold flannels and a date was offered. We were then Taken to our room. 

Although this sounds picky... It was so different to the attention we normally receive. And on our departure, we are normally taken to the lobby by our butler. This never happened. We walked out of the main doors on our own, and was ignored. We had to ask for out phantom. Only to be ushered to the side of the hotel to get in the car. Normally the car comes to the front and again you are made to feel Special as a manger normally farewells you off!! As far As we were concerned nobody knew we were there, from the moment we arrived at the hotel to the moment we left. 

On our departure a bellboy asked how our stay was. When I replied how dissapointing it had been and we would never return again his reply was ""excellent. We look forward to seeing you again next year!!""

I could go on about other things. Service was overall lacking in many places. Especially bab al yam, we were once again ignored, plates weren't cleared, weren't offered drinks. 

We are normally greeted by our name in most areas, this was never the case this time. The butlers messed up reservations. We had to ask for a wine list in al muntaha. And thei lst goes on and on. 

Although these points might sound a little picky, when we normally receive the 7 star level of service that the burj is renown for, this trip was extremelly dissapointing. We received a better level of service and was made to feel more special at the 5 star grosvenor and we regretted leaving there to spend 3 nights at the so called 7 star burj!! 

We emailed Heinrich morio, not to receive anything for free but to let him know how dissapointed we were and how his hotel did not deliver in so many ways. We only hope for other people who are attending to visit that things are improved.. We however will never return to find out. Life is too precious and they have had so many chances!! ","2","2014-06"
"Not a hotel - an experience","We enjoyed 2 nights here for my wife's birthday. From start to finish, it was a totally enjoyable experience.
I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. but nothing - nothing compares to this.
The service is efficient, without being over the top. Nothing is too hard.
The rooms are exquisite - like nothing else I have ever experienced.
Its it expensive? - Yes
Is it value? - Yes
Will we return? - Yes","5","2014-07"
"Worst service I've ever experienced, definitely NOT a 7 star hotel","Terrible hotel, not one staff knew what time restaurants opened, that you needed booking, you couldn't just get a simple drink somewhere, at the spa they couldn't find change and made you wait 15 mins for it, they also couldn't find a bag for the 'gift' they gave you at the end of it - I've stayed at 4 Seasons, Ritz Carlton's, W hotels, each were MUCH better as the staff a actually WERE TRAINED PROPERLY AND KNEW ABOUT THE HOTEL FACILITIES AND TIMINGS. I wouldn't go back to that hotel if someone paid me to.","1","2014-07"
"The Culinary Flight","My husband and I did the Culinary flight whilst staying in Dubai.  6 Courses 6 restaurants, an amazing way to sample each of the beautiful restaurants at the Burj Al Arab.  The service is second to none, from the initial reception to the close of the car door when leaving they have it nailed.  I would recommend this to any lover of food and wine.  I can't wait to go back and do it again.  Seeing the Burj in 'real life' was amazing in itself I think its still the stand out building of Dubai.","5","2014-07"
"Not exactly what you expect....","Let me start by saying that to look at (inside and out) this hotel is absolutely fantastic. We had a end suite over 2 floors with floor to ceiling windows and the view was phenomenal. The facilities in the room were amazing and I really can't rate them highly enough. 
The customer service on the other hand was slightly lacking and at £1000 per night, you would have expected better. We dealt with the issues on site so it didn't spoil the holiday but you are left with a feeling that day trippers here are actually treated better than hotel guests. 
Really not suitable for kids under 12 as they are not allowed in some of the restaurants at night however they do have a member of staff who continually walks around handing out sweets which my 4 year old loved. 
Overall, a great experience and some interesting z list celeb spotting!","4","2014-06"
"True Luxury everyone should experience","As experienced traveler, I thought nothing can surprise me in terms of luxury hotels in Dubai. But this was an outstanding experience, from the very beginning. As soon as the car door was opened, we were greeted by the hostess by name, and the lady took us straight to our suite, where we did the check in. Very fast and efficient. Then we were introduced to a butler, who gave a tour of the room. All the rooms in Burj are duplex (very spacious and you definitely need a tour). Everything is electronic but very very easy to control. A room is full of various flower compositions and bouquets. Bottle of wine, fruits, 5 pm snacks, water, tea, coffee, Arabic sweets are all complimentary. All toiletries are Hermes (full size).  The design of the room is very nice: bright, but tasteful. Projector clock on the wall is very cool. The bed can be arranged at your preference (soft, medium soft or hard). The butler will run a Jacuzzi for you. I felt like not leaving the room and enjoy it every minute: the view, the relaxation, room service, etc.  All staff were very helpful, they had answers on all your questions. The hotel is nice for both couples and families with kids. Everyone must experience what luxury is.
This is real luxury and cost every dirham you pay.","5","2014-07"
"Travel between luxury and international cooking","I was here for five days with my family. The structure of hotel is really amazing like the rooms as well. For living a vacation of luxury this hotel is the perfect choice and every room could be considered a suite. Another good experience in this hotel is the cooking, in fact it has some restaurant: arabic restaurant for eating food of the area, fish restaurant that is 'subsea', the glamourous restaurant at the last floor of hotel, and at last the restaurant of Asian area where you can eat all the gastronomic specialities of Japan, India, Thailand, China etc...
Everything, from the service to the quality of breakfast is fantastic and this is an experience that all should have once in their life.
Obviously prices are so much expensive but it's the price of perfection.","5","2013-08"
"beautiful as expected","we live in dubai, but due to our anniversary, we decided to treat ourself.
I emailed ahead to advise it was our anniversary, and on arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom gorgeous bedroom/ apartment!!
the service was fantastic and we challenged them with a sewing kit, hair bands and other items we needed.
The pool of the actual hotel is a bit of a let down, as the drinks are very expensive and the atmosphere is lacking!
However the premium pool you can use just a buggy ride away is fantastic. lovely swim up bar, and a nice buzzing atmosphere, and you can admire the burn instead of being right under it.
Service again fantastic.
Later in the evening we received a fabulous cake and whole tray of roses to the room, which was simply fantastic and a very lovely gesture.
The only downside was that the asian buffet we ate in had lower standards than we would expect from the worlds only self proclaimed 7 star hotel, but once pointed this out to the manager they dealt with my concerns in a very professional and up beat attitude.
It is a great experience that we are so glad we have done. 
defiantly worth the visit.","5","2014-04"
"Luxury hotel","Here you can feel yourself like queen or king :) There is no words to describe the feeling you get when entering this wonderful hotel. And the feeling continues wherever you go or whatever you do. For example when we were eating there were own waiter for everyone of us and musicans playing music for us etc. And they also paid extra-attention to our kids. Just love this hotel. Only minus is that it's very expensive.","5","2013-11"
"Once in a lifetime experience!","Flashy, extravagant and luxurious.. spacious rooms, private butler services, beautiful views, hermes toiletries, the works.. Fantastic checkin process, personalised breakfast.

but is it the most luxurious hotel, i wouldn't go that far. is it worth the high price as compared to whats available otherwise, well almost but still overpriced.

but we had a special occasion which called for that splash of extravagance.. glad we did :)","4","2014-06"
"What a great experience","Checked into Burj for three night stay,i have always stayed at the other Jumeirah hotels .Always wondered why people would spend this much money and how special could it be .  But this was great .Burj was by far one of the most luxurious hotel i ever stayed in.Every thing was well thought of,people were warm and caring .I dont think i could ever enjoy any other hotel so much .I have decided post this stay to only stay at the best hotels around the world and experience the best luxoury.I think Burj was the best way to begin","5","2014-02"
"Spend your birthday there if you can","There's nothing much to say about it. It's simply the best hotel there is. I've stayed there twice already, my parents did 3 times. The ladies' swimming pool overlooks the hotels around, it is unforgettable. En-suite breakfast: WOW!!! Have to try it at least once! Also, don't miss the chance of sunbathing on the grass near the breakfast restaurant. You won't regret not being in the shopping malls. I've also spent my 18th birthday there. The suprises kept coming all day long, up until the very last 10 minutes of my day. It was the best birthday ever!! 
Everything is to die for!","5","2014-02"
"One night you have to try the highest star hotel and resort in the world, is it excellent yes, is it worth extra no.","Yes, total luxury.

The building is the ultimate in opulence. Security first class. Areas for viewing from pool deck to roof too just spectacular. Sunsets spectacular, nighttime walk around premises wow!!!

If you had the money would you live and die here? Yes, bloody oath! Would they let you, probably not, batting above your average and class little fella unless you plot some oil sadly.

But for one night, to experience the best, it's a must try, everybody equally deserves that but very few will get in to try sadly.

One down point was the service. Entry and guidance was ok, but in the restaurants it was pretty obvious you were not assessed as a high roller and we will focus on the big end if town. You pay your bill but it's not the big end which us what counts and will come back often. So you're left sort of hollow, the good is great but the service is so neglectful ghost you think is the good really that great, is it worth that much extra and the answer is sadly no. 

See it takes people to make experiences as well as Italian marble and seafood. For that reason, like a casino, if you don't have the cash to blow give it a miss and you can buy yourself 3-5 other experiences instead (or an Armani suit as I did after checkout). This was the wife's reward, what she wished for and she was regretful afterwards that it didn't meet her expectation. I still have the suit and I love it!!!","4","2014-06"
"Afternoon tea in the sky view bar... Unmissable!","What a fantastic time we had here. The afternoon tea is expensive but worth every penny. You are treated like royalty.
We arrived and had a look round the hotel lobby, then travelled up the lift with amazing views, up to the skybar. We were seated at a window table looking over Dubai. The waiters were fantastic, the food was lovely and I was presented with a rose at it was our honeymoon. A real treat!","5","2014-07"
"There is something which you have not experienced. ...This is it !","Security at entrance was politely impressive. Reception by door man spells class of the place which you are going to experience. On our entrance we were greeted by reception who personally saw us to the lift to upstairs for reserved breakfast booked in advance by us. View inside and from inside looks awesome and defines a class of its own. Needless to say we took many pictures and we're even helped by staff. Menu was extensive. We had selected north and south indian vegetarian breakfast.  Mint cooler was awesome start to tickle the taste buds. Rasmalai was well prepared nd fresh. Sadly the curry accompanying parantha was disappointing in sense it lacked maturity of taste and amalgamation of flavours expected from a world class dining experience. This has already been conveyed in my personalised feedback seeked by hotel. Ambience and spell binding architecture makes up for everything. Menus was served and sweet dish was served after we had paid the bill. Not expected but still giving benefit of doubt. Majestic piano overlooking the colorful water fountains lays an ultimate forefront to the large golden pillars. 
Visit it to experience it. Worth  a dime spent rather a bigger dime.","4","2014-06"
"High tea - and I mean high1","Having seen a documentary about the building of this hotel, I have always longed to see it. It is a fabulous piece of architecture, and a brilliant piece of engineering. A room in this hotel is way above our budget, and therefore, to see it inside, I booked a high tea for my son and myself in the Sky Bar situated right at the top of the hotel. It was Ramadan and the hottest month of the year, which meant that we had the restaurant to ourselves to start with, and when we left I suppose about 12 people were there. I understand that it is normally full, and had booked through the Internet in advance.

It is over the top, it is true, but also fascinating and beautiful inside and out. The high tea costs about €112, and for this you get a delicious menu and fine teas to choose from. We were given more to eat than we needed. Sitting next to a window in a room hanging out over the sea, and looking down to the yachting marina below us was a wonderful setting.

We only had one day in Dubai, and I really only wanted to see this hotel, and the Burj Khalifa. I am so glad we did: Dubai holds otherwise few charms for us.","4","2014-07"
"7 star hotel, 7 star service, well said","7 star hotel, 7 star service, well said.. just wonders full! I'm a hotel professional but this is more than luxury.. fabulous service.. prompt response to any complaint.. well maintained facility.. congrats! Best in Dubai","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea","Superb opulent experience , absolutely worth the money! Attentive friendly staff, delicious food and just pure luxury!! I'll certainly be back! First visit to Dubai and they treated us like royalty, certainly worth a visit people!","5","2014-04"
"7 star hotel, 7 star service","I am a Dubai resident and heard a lot about this Iconic hotel. I booked lunch at Al Iwan restaurent for my family & guests (Not for food) but to have world class experience. 
Booking procedure: My call quickly connected to F&B and based on my preference (I am pure vegetarian), they recommended Al Iwan which is on First floor.
Time: Thy tool almost 10 minute to take my booking which is worth as they explained everything from Menu, dress code, options available for Veggie etc
Food: It was perfect, to our surprise their Chef met us personally and ask their staff to serve Indian food specially prepared for us.
Price: Expensive but worth spending
Views from Restaurent: Amazing
Overall experience: Since we had confirmed booking, we got 7 star treatment start from entrance, also got a chance to view the hotel from lobby and certain area.
","5","2014-01"
"Afternoon Tea - Fantastic!","Went for afternoon tea and it was a great way to spend an afternoon.  The hotel is beautiful and you feel very special as soon as you walk through the door.  All of the staff are very friendly & helpful.
The whole experience was fantastic, from the elevator ride to the Sea View Bar to the tea itself, you just couldn't fault it.
We were seated at an outer table by the window with spectacular views.  The seven courses were beautifully presented & tasted delicious. The service was second to none and the staff were very knowledgeable and attentive.  This does seem expensive but it is worth every penny & I'd definitely recommend it.
We were there as part of a special wedding anniversary holiday and this was highlighted with the presentation of a beautiful red rose for me & my husband got lovely cake.
Loved every minute and would like to thank everyone at the Sea a View Bar for making it so special.","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea - Fabulous","This was such a wonderful experience to have afternoon tea at this 7* hotel. It just oozes luxury as soon as you walk in. Savour this visit because it's not something you do every day. It's quite expensive but well worth the experience. The staff were so attentive and saw to our every need. We were shown to a window table so had just the best view of the Jumeirah Beach hotel and the coastline. You don't need anything to eat before you go, just enjoy the delicious treats offered. Well worth a visit. An experience to behold. Enjoy.","5","2014-02"
"A Truly Seven Star Experience","After looking forward to staying at the Burj Al Arab, we were certainly not disappointed in any way.   On arrival at the hotel we were immediately greeted from our transport by our name, welcomed with refreshments and taken straight to our guest suite without having to check in at reception. We were introduced to our butler on our way to our suite and were checked in when we entered our suite.  Check in was smooth and painless, followed by a tour of the suite and facilities.   We booked into a panoramic suite which was very impressive.  Upstairs was the bedroom suite with magnificent bathroom and dressing area.   The bed was a comfortable king sized bed with hide away TV.  The bathroom had a huge shower area with rain shower and a two person whirl pool bath.

Downstairs had a little office area, huge living room area, a bar area and a cloakroom.  All of this was surrounded by wall to ceiling windows which gave a wonderful view of Dubai and the Gulf.

The service was impeccable, the butler was always on call and quick to respond and every evening a bubble bath was prepared for us.  Nothing was too much trouble.  There are no faults we could mention.  Check out was as easy as check in, so no lining up at a reception in the lobby.   This was one of the best experiences we have ever had in our many travels and would have no hesitation in returning or recommending this fabulous hotel and wonderful staff.  

One key point that we found very impressive was that the butlers always knew who you were and which room you were staying at which gives that personal touch.","5","2014-06"
"Wow wow and wow. 7 star hotel","What an amazing hotel, I have been here twice now and it is faultless. The surroundings inside and out are just amazing which is why it holds the accolade of being the best hotel in the world. The afternoon tea is delightful with a string quartet playing in the background which is just exquisite. The sky bar offers amazing views of Dubai seeing some iconic landmarks.  The staff are extremely tentative and polite. Go and visit, even if it's for a meal or afternoon tea but remember you have to book in advance. ","5","2013-08"
"Afternoon Tea - Expensive, OTT but Unmissable!","Booked this as a belated wedding anniversary treat for my husband and myself but wisely didn't tell my husband the cost - the secret of 34 yrs of marriage!
It was everything I imagined - glitzy, gaudy, OTT but great fun.
I won't repeat what everyone else has said just make sure you get there early to be able to look round, don't eat anything before you go, savour what you do eat and just enjoy.","5","2014-07"
"Afternoon Tea Skyview Bar","We visited The Burj Al Arab for Afternoon Tea in the Skyview Bar in July.

From entering the Burj the service was excellent. We were seated with a window view which overlooked both The Palm and the Jumeriah beach coast. Our waiter was friendly and accomodating and took photographs for us. The service was attentive and we were offered teas, coffees, water and date juice throughout our afternoon tea. 

The food was lovely, with a strawberry shortbread to start, followed by beef, sandwiches/wraps, scones with jam and clotted cream, cakes and pastries, finishing with a sorbet. The ladies were given a small box of chocolates to take away with us. 

I really enjoyed Afternoon Tea at the Burj and would definitely recommend to others. Looking forward to going back to amazing Dubai and the Burj! ","5","2014-07"
"As in a fairy tale","We spent 10 days with my family and I have to say we were really excited. 
To service in this hotel??? It is simply the best in a world, but I would specially like to thank the staff, especially the maids who cleaned several times a day and porters(doorman) they were incredibly kind and helpful.

Thank you very much and see you next year:)

Family from Czech republic.","5","2014-07"
"Nothing else compares","Easily the most luxurious hotel I've ever and will ever stay in. Staff will go out off their way to serve your every need. Private beach and pool area is lovely. We stayed in one of the panoramic suites with an outstanding view. Ridiculously expensive but for us worth every penny. Highly recommend for a special occasion such as engagement/anniversary or honeymoon. You will feel like royalty for the duration of your stay.","5","2014-06"
"Arabian Splendour","Hands down the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in, there as a special treat for wifes birthday & it is totally over the top and ludicrous cost but its worth every penny just for the experience... Highly recommended","5","2013-08"
"Nice stay for our anniversary trip","We just loved there, everything....
The staff were amazing, nice, responsive and made everything to make us happy.
We get a free cake for our anniversary, they put flowers on our table, and they even bring us more than we asked for.
The view on the top was nice, loved all the restaurants there.
highly recommanded, will definetly come back.","5","2014-03"
"Afternoon tea poor service not 7 star!","We booked afternoon tea to end our holiday in luxury but were very disappointed. The hotel is stunning and it is amazing when you enter the lobby and view the atrium. We spent some time looking round and were really in awe of our surroundings however when you get to the sky view bar it is a little odd the decor is not as expected and dated. The walls as you enter are fashioned like a computer mother board with flashing lights but this didn't put us off the highlight of our holiday. We were seated facing the ocean a stunning and spectacular view, we were offered sparking date juice as it was Ramadan and no alcohol was being served which we had been made aware of. 
Our waiter didn't spend anytime with us or engaged with us at all other guests had been given a flower I wasn't, other guests were having their photograph taken by their waiter ours was nowhere to be seen. We had to get someone's attention to order coffee as one glass of sparking date juice is definitely enough.  We ordered a second coffee which never arrived and we had to get another waiters attention. 
The food wasn't amazing dates are offered with a drink, strawberry shortcake, then a slice of beef which wasn't warm and quite wet with not much taste, sandwiches were served which were attractive then a selection of cakes pastries and scones. The scones were nice as far as scones go but the cakes and pastries were very rich and tasteless. There wasn't even one each so we could try the same things. 
The waiter was no where to be seen we sat with the cakes in front of us for a while we were not offered more or offered the option of taking away any in a box like the other guests seated by the side. 
We again got someone's attention and asked for a drink of water I prefer my water with lemon and no ice what I got was a glass of warm tap water at which point we decided to leave very disappointed. We had to ask for the bill and when I signed the cheque the waiter stood looking through the papers for his tip! He was very rude,  he was ignorant and ruined what should have been the highlight of our holiday. 
Other guests seemed to experience better service but our service I was not seven star.
I have emailed the restaurant with my concerns and feedback but 24 hours later have not yet had a response.
Very disappointed!","1","2014-07"
"Spectacular hotel and staff","Very responsive staff and spectacular surroundings.  Bar on top of the hotel has a great view if you happen to be up there on a somewhat clear day / evening.  Staff will go out of there way to make sure any request is accommodated.  Beach near by is great fun as well.  Try the hotel restaurants, they are all very good.","5","2013-12"
"Stunning","Everything about the hotel is stunning, including the price! 

Seriously though, the architecture, the decor, the rooms, the staff, the restaurants - all amazing. If you have the chance to stay here, do it. Go ahead and spoil yourself - I doubt very much that you'll be disappointed. My wife and I loved every moment of our stay. The room was opulent and the spa bath was divine. I could go on with the superlatives but I'm sure you get the idea!

Oh and make sure you dine in the Al Mahara restaurant while you're there.","5","2014-07"
"Excellent 7 stars  hotel","it was realy amazing visit to burj alarab with my husband and my doghter & amazing dinner at almahara restaurant 

thank you very much to restaurant staff & sayed in call center for ur assistant.

i really want to visit the hotel next time may be next christmas we will celebrate our honeymoon","5","2014-07"
"Hi -Tea Definitely something to do","We went for the hi-tea (Booking is essential to even enter the hotel grounds)! Definitly something to do if you are planning a trip. The high tea is a bit pricey but you eat until you can not eat no more… Friendly staff, amazing food and service! Will definitely recommend it.","5","2014-07"
"Paradise - a dream come true!","Stayed at The Burj for a week in May with my husband and I can honestly say that I have never stayed in a hotel as fabulous as this in my life and probably never will again unless I go back of course!  I could go on forever but the comfort, service, food and entire experience surpassed any expectations I might have had and I felt like a princess or a week.  We are going to book again for the same week next year and I am counting down the months already.","5","2014-05"
"Don't believe the hype","Not what I expected from a hotel claiming to be the only 7 star in the world,the decor has begun to be dated and even the staff seem to be a notch below the other hotels.A must visit when coming to Dubai but not what I expected.","3","2014-06"
"Unforgettable Meal, absolutely astounding","This really is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. We booked for dinner in the sky bar restaurant at 8pm, and arrived at 7pm for drinks before hand. The hotel itself is stunning, and truly worth its seven stars. The dancing fountains in the lobby, the fish tank walls by the escalators, it really is beautiful. 

Upon arrival in the restaurant we were seated at a lovely table and were brought a little stand in the shape of the hotel itself with nibbles on. All were exceptionally tasty and we were impressed to see these were also refilled during our drinks. 
We were taken to our seats in the dining area, and I do not think there are words to do this restaurant or the staff justice. The cannot do enough for you in any shape or form. The complimentary amuse bouche was to die for. For starters two out of the three of us ordered the scallops. These were absolutely stunning, and the largest starter portion for scallops I have ever seen, they were worth every single penny, cooked to absolute perfection. For mains I had the fillet steak which was cooked beautifully and the side of veg is rather large, so probably best for two people to share as we did. 

At the end of the meal myself and the other lady present were given a bouquet of roses which was extremely kind and a lovely touch at the end of the meal. 

The wine was delicious, the staff were exceptionally hard working and courteous, and the chefs cooked the best food I have ever tasted. It has been a number of years since I last visited this restaurant but I am certainly hoping to revisit in the next few months. People may say that it is expensive, but you are paying for exceptional quality, stunning environment, beautifully served food and very hard working staff giving the standard of service that something extra that you do not find elsewhere.","5","2014-06"
"Exciting.","Rooms are amazing, all suites with bedrooms upstairs, all you could ask for in this 7star gem. However! The food was average and the wines were ridiculously priced, why do they try and rip you off like that, the hotel is pricy enough. Once in a lifetime is enough, but glad we went, if not to say at least we'd been there.","4","2013-08"
"Amazing! I know 7 star does not exist but if it did this hotel would be 7*.","I have read some of the negative reviews on here for the Burj Al Arab. So I was worried about the service I would receive but from arrival to departure the service was first class. Me and the other half arrived from Mauritius and it was close to 130am so we were totally shattered. We arrived at the hotel and were shown to our suite on the 14th floor. A lovely butler asked if we wanted a quick run through of everything. He was aware that we had been on a long flight so told us this could be done the following morning. We opted to have the tour there and then. 
The room had a bottle of lovely sparkling grape juice, Hermes set for her and him and more towels than there was any need for. 
The suite was massive and apparently this is just a ""normal"" room at this hotel. We tried the jacuzzi the following night and again it was amazing. Pure luxury! We had dinner in the Al Iwan restaurant which was again very tasty. The chef Tariq was amazing and cooked my other half vegetarian dishes that were not on the menu. Tariq is what all hotel staff should be friendly, courteous and goes the extra mile.
The beds were the most comfortable I have slept in for a long time.
It was my other halfs birthday a few days before and the butlers on our floor came in with a bouquet of roses and a chocolate cake for her and wished her a belated happy birthday. This was totally unexpected and just gave her the biggest smile.
Yes for some people this hotel might be to opulent. To many things going on but for me it is perfect! From the appearance to the staff this truly is a 7 star hotel. Just a shame we only stayed 2 nights.
I would advise that if you do book a ""normal suite"" ask for a room with a view of the Gulf as the views at sunrise and sunset are amazing!","5","2014-06"
"Awesome High Tea","High tea at the Sky Bar was just beautiful, great food and service and the view from our table was fantastic, looking right along the beach. The food was exceptional, everything was done to perfection, its expensive but something you should experience if you are visiting Dubai. The hotel is beautiful with a gorgeous waterfall cascading down steps and a fantastic aquarium you can look at whilst using the escalator.","5","2014-03"
"High tea at Burj Al Arab","My wife booked high tea for us at the burj al arab and it was good. Got a glass of louis roederer brut champagne which was good. Pastry with berries on was very good.  Chef's carvery which was beef with mash which was perfectly prepared. Selection of different breads which was only ok...not great. And then some sweet things like fine desserts, cakes, scones, etc. and it ended of with some sorbet. They offered many different teas from all over the world and some nice coffees and iced drinks. Service was good and staff was very friendly. Everything was good...I was just expecting more for it being a 7 star hotel...maybe you will only experience the other two stars if you stay as a guest at the hotel☺.","4","2014-06"
"the wonderfull room","wonderful hotel design and service. Fantastic lobby with the play of light and water, a huge aquarium and glitz total. The suite on two floors great, equipped with all comforts (plasma TV, laptop with internet, fax machine, a fridge stocked bar etc..

"Friday Brunch at Burj Al Arab","From walking through the entrance to the service once we reached the 25th floor for brunch was amazing .Upon greeted for my booking to be shown to table was excellent
The service was excellent , the food amazing & the variety was out of this world . The staff couldn't do enough for you .From pulling out chair, pouring tea , water ,folding napkin .fresh cutely ,was done as soon as you had finished .The variety of all the food was amazing , that you didn't know what to have . Not cheap , but well worth the experience .I would recommend it to any one stopping in Dubai ,& would go back again if ever staying in Dubai

"Thank you Burj...You are amazing!","We stayed for one night for my son's birthday and truly Burj Al arab lives up to its title as a 7-star luxury hotel. We were surprised by the guest services team by singing/surprising my son with a ""happy bday song"" and a complimentary cake and wines followed by tons of chocolate and sweets. All the staffs are hands-on and always a step ahead and anticipating your needs. I would rate a perfect 10 for everything except that the lifeguard named ""Kc or Casey"" on the 18th floor on the family pool wasn't that smiling and accommodating since i saw her take turn with the other lifeguard or maybe i was just expecting too much and thinking of consistency since i can't help but compare her from the rest of the staffs. Still it was an awesome-A1 experience overall. Special thanks to the Butler team and the IT team for their technical help. Burj did not just created an experience but memories for my family and friends. Thank you for the wonderful night.","5","2014-06"
"Afternoon tea @ Burj Al Arab","This was our little piece of extravagance on a 4 day trip to Dubai.  We chose the afternoon tea option in the SkyView bar on the 27th floor.  Walking up the entrance road and entering the hotel itself felt amazing - it really is opulence & decadence at it's finest.  Afternoon tea was excellent.  We had been told previously to eat before we went as the portions were very small.  This may be correct but it is fine dining and we were also offered extra sandwiches if we wanted them.  There was absolutely more than enough to eat and it was very tasty, so much so that we couldn't actually finish what was in front of us!  The views from the bar were also incredible and the staff were extremely friendly.  I would recommend.","5","2014-06"
"Afternoon high tea at the Burj al Arab","Mother's Day present from my son. 7 courses of amazing food with spectacular view. Sandwiches and cakes. The staff were delightful and happy to suggest drinks and explain what everything was. So many teas to choose from it was an amazing experience to be remembered forever.","5","2014-06"
"High Tea at the Burj al Arab","We booked to have high tea and cocktails at 7pm at the Burj, the hotel is simply jaw dropping inside, absolutely beautiful, we were on a mezzanine level above the lobby with a handful of other guests having high tea, first we were served sparkling wine with a selection of sandwiches, then scones, clotted cream and preserves with a cocktail of our choice and lastly a choice of teas with beautiful little cakes, then a little hiccup,  the waitress knocked my drink all over the table and we had to be moved, she was very polite but did not ask me if I was ok as most of the 'red' cocktail was spilt on my Mulberry bag so I had to use my napkin to clean it, thankfully it did not mark it, we were asked if we were there for a special occasion, which we were, my husbands birthday and our wedding anniversary, my husband was given a beautiful cake, I was given a red rose and a tiny box of cakes and the quartet played happy birthday and love songs, it was simply lovely and I am so pleased we went, it was approx £65 pp.","5","2014-06"
"Luxury","We stayed here for two nights after staying at another Dubai hotel.  This was our splurge for the trip.   
Let me start with the pros:  The staff are really at another level to most hotels and really were fantastic in most of the hotel.  We had suite 1212 and it was enormous!!!  The views fantastic and the feeling of space and luxury has certainly been achieved.  The rooms are very ornate and personal Hermes toiletries were a treat.  We went to the gym and were lucky enough to have it to ourselves.  We were treated to a personal training session which we are still recovering from (some will see this as a con).  
I don't regret staying here and aspects were wonderful but I wish I would have known to pack my own wine & snacks!  Enjoy the amenities but eat elsewhere.
The cons: Maybe it's just me but when you pay as much as you do for this hotel you have very high expectations.  I resented the exorbitant prices for everything once at the hotel.  Soft drink from the mini bar AED40!!!  Divide that by 3 if you're an Aussie.   We all know wine is marked up considerably no matter where you go but charging equivalent of $300AUD for a bottle of wine you know is usually $60-80AUD is hard to take.  
We were kindly offered an afternoon snack of open sandwiches and a drink which was a lovely touch and we accepted.  When we returned from dinner that evening our room had been cleaned but the left over open sandwiches had not been cleared away. 
The in -room dining was also excessively priced with snacks starting at $30AUD.
The ""fine dining"" restaurant on level 27 lacked ambience.  The staff appeared too rushed and you felt like a bother if you took some time to choose a dish.  We ordered the bottle of wine, a steak which was nice but not spectacular (which you expect for the price charged) and the lamb shoulder (listed as slow cooked but tasted just ok & texture of boiled meat I'm sorry to say).  I only finished the meal (palmed some off too!) because I felt it would be rude to leave it.   We walked away with a $700AUD bill and somewhat dissatisfied","4","2014-06"
"The most luxurious hotel in the world","We arrived at the Burj Al Arab for a 2 night stay in a panoramic suite at the end of our month long holiday . We ended up extending for another 2 nights.From the moment you enter the Burj we were looked after like never before.We were treated by Olga who took us to a quiet area as the lobby was so busy, it was a lovely touch .Olga was fantastic and she then took us up to our floor and introduced us to our butlers and an introduction to our suite.The room was out of this world and worth the extra to upgrade from a normal suite as the 180 degree views were to die for.Our butlers then unpacked for us while we went and had lunch down near the pool.After a wonderful lunch and swim we returned to find an issue with someone doing their business in our toilet and not flushing, one of our butlers were disgusted and proceeded to get 2 managers who brought my Wife a beautiful bunch of flowers and were very quick to fix the issue (a sign of a good company to act so quickly).We moved on from that and had drinks at the Skybar with a great waiter Shelby and experienced a marriage proposal .Then proceeded to have dinner down in the Al Mahara restaurant  and had the most wonderful romantic evening of our lives.The service was out of this world and had a wonderful evening with George the large fish been there since the beginning and a lovely new lady from France who helped us with the menu and fantastic service from Paul from Sri Lanka .The staff on the beach were great with a nice touch having icy poles and drinks to help with the heat of the day.We also had a romantic dinner in our suite with the most exquisite food and views.We also dined at the other signature restaurant Al Muntaha which had great view and awesome food.
A special thank you to the best butlers of all  Kirwan , Anas and Rhon where nothing was a problem and handled us with everything we needed, including extending our stay and reorganising our flights.
A special thank you to Tetiana in the Al Dukan gift shop who showed great patience and understanding in choosing our gift for friends and family .
We had a wonderful stay and understand why the Burj is the best most luxurious hotel in the world do yourself a favor and tick this one off your bucket list it's worth every cent to spoil yourself once in your life.","5","2014-06"
"Amazing hotel, perfect setting.","I was lucky enough to stay here with my new husband when we stayed in Dubai as part of our Honeymoon. We had a honeymoon suite which was just stunning. It was such an amazing experience. From being chauffeur driven to and from the airport, the amazing rooms, views and quality of food. I can honestly say I don't think anywhere else could beat it. I would definitely recommend going. We made use of the facilities including the spa, private beach and water park. Definitely worth a visit xx","5","2013-09"
"A little disappointed","Booked drinks in the Skybar whilst on holiday with a friend as we were both celebrating birthdays and thought it would be a fantastic experience as a birthday treat. Upon arrival at the hotel there were lots of people milling about and it was a bit confusing where we were supposed to go. We approached a staff member who advised us to go up the escalator then take the lift to the 27th floor. We admired the wonderful massive aquarium whilst travelling up the escalator and then passed lots of expensive shops on the way to what we thought was the correct lift. There were other people standing by the lift however, as the doors opened a staff member approached us and quickly, buy politely ushered us away from the area. She took us to a lift behind the reception area and pressed the button to take us up to the skybar. The lift was made of glass but as it was evening time, it was dark and we couldn't see anything but darkness. I'm sure this lift journey would be great in daylight looking out to sea. Upon arrival at the skybar a staff member approached us and wished us both a happy birthday, which we both thought was a lovely personalised touch, she then passed us over to a waiter who took us to our seats. The bar was quite busy with what I can only assume to be tourists who all seemed to be crammed into one seating area. The staff were ever so polite and attentive however, I really got the feeling it was all a bit conveyer belt-y and rushed. We were brought some menus for bar snacks and cocktails along with a little tiered tray contaning nuts, 2 x mini quiches and 2 x salmon and caviar canapes. We ordered cocktails (costing on average £25 each) which were nice but I wouldn't go as far to say they were any different from cocktails from any other place in the world that sells them! We were then brought a little cake each with happy birthday written on and a rose which I did think was a really nice gesture. After around an hour, our waiter approached us and said there was a window table now free if we would like to move. We said that would be lovely and he moved everything for us and sat us at a table with the most stunning view. Upon leaving we arrived back at the lobby area and were quickly ushered into a taxi (a very expensive one!). All in all I am glad that I went as it is a nice experience however, it all seemed a bit rushed and a bit 'fake'. It would be very interesting to compare this experience if I ever book in as a 'real' overpaying hotel guest.","3","2014-06"
"Cannot fault it","I was lucky enough to stay here as a wedding gift and was not disappointed. We were upgraded to a corner suite, a split level bigger than many apartments with great views of the gulf and Dubai. We had guests over one night and they cooked cakes for us. Everything about the place was perfect. Each level has it's own butler and concierge who greets you each time you enter your level from the lift. I am usually quite shy and hate the awkwardness of this type of small talk but it is really natural with this staff who do appear to genuinely care about you and want to make sure you have the best experience possible. I think it was this that sets it apart from the rest. The pampering is to excess but everyone should give it a try at least once.","5","2013-08"
"Afternoon Tea","We visited the Burj Al Arab Skyview Bar for afternoon tea on 18th June and we had a lovely time.  It's expensive but worth it for a one-off experience.  The food was delicious and there was lots of it - six courses in all including a glass of champagne and as much tea as you could drink.  The choice of teas was extensive and we were impressed with the waiting staff's knowledge and advice offered.  The service was attentive although at times we felt it was obvious that we were part of a rather large 'sitting' - it's certainly not an intimate setting but the views are fantastic.  We mentioned our trip to Dubai was to celebrate my birthday and they surprised me with a birthday cake complete with candle and a beautiful red rose and they insisted on taking pictures of us both which was a nice touch. ","4","2014-06"
"Still got it!!","We booked a summer dream package direct with hotel. Picked up from airport in a big Merc with driver dressed all in white and a big smile. Choice of music in car Great start. First 2 nights in DAR then last night in the Burj.

Best words ever on checkin ' You have a free upgrade!!' Massive panoramic suite with great views, room was perfect as good as all reviews say.

Second stay here so the butlers gave us more space but very attentive. to the pool and comfy loungers and attentive pool guys. hotel seemed very quiet which made it feel even more exclusive.

I must say that the meals let the place down! compared to the feel of the place and high levels of service the food is just average for a 3/4 star hotel so at the burj with its high prices its not good value in fact somewhat disappointing. That included breakfast and Junsi restaurant which also lacked any atmosphere. Skybar great.

Couples massage included in price. This was great, amazing Spa and great massage loved it.

Easy check out and we did so late with no fuss-so professional.

It was my birthday and the Butlers brought me a full bottle of Champagne, cake, card and fruit. Great touch of class cheers

In summary to stay here is amazing, go elsewhere for your food-they are catering for the passing trade of hotel tourists and is suffering as a result. Great experience splash out!!","5","2014-06"
"High Tea","I went with my husband, our 10 year old twin boys and my friend who lives in Dubai.  She suggested we book in for the high tea as it was a once in a lifetime experience.  We were not disappointed.  The food, drinks and service was top notch and the inside of the building is absolutely amazing.  My boys had to keep pinching themselves, as did I!  

We later had drinks in the bar on the top floor with friends and it took was amazing.

Yes you pay through the nose for both, but it's not like anything else you would experience anywhere else.  I'm glad we did it.","4","2014-01"
"Enjoy it dont walk on your tip toes.","Ive stayed here every year since it opened, sometimes twice a year. This hotel prides itself on service, there a none better. What most people fail to see is just how friendly this place is. Because of its reputation many think its stuffy, you couldnt be farther from the truth. Its actually intimate. 

If your staying you will experience superior service and surroundings. The suites are immaculate. You have your own butler on call 24/7. The restaurants are all excellent.

If you are planning to come for a meal only you dont really see the hotels heart and soul. But your Dhiram is as good as anyone else's so enjoy the experience. It wont be cheap and it will cost you, but you will have a great meal.","5","2014-03"
"Golrified McDonalds","Booked for dinner at the Al Muntaha restaurant  and was emailed a confirmation with a list of what to wear, long sleeve shirt, jacket for men, no open toed footwear for ladies.
On arrival at the hotel we were shocked to find it was like Westminster Abby...full tourists (mainly Chinese) taking photos of everything and everyone.
I though ""well at least the restaurant would be different..."" I was shocked to see many other dinners dressed as though we were in a glorified McDonalds, the chap at the table opposite had no jacket and short sleeves and his wife had on a pair of flip flops......we actually felt overdress..!! after a ""consultation"" with the manager he very quickly booked us into the Al Mahara down stairs and the restaurant where a jacket is compulsory . Food fantastic  and staff exemplary just what I was expecting (but a bit more expensive)
Conclusion:-
Its a tourist attraction and only they say its 7 stars.... glad I had not booked to stay","3","2014-06"
"Twice as Expensive, but Three Times as Good.","We stayed one night at the Burj for our wedding anniversary, with our children aged 10 and 13, in between other hotels in Dubai.  Wow!!  What an experience.  The room was amazing - they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite - a massive apartment, with beautiful views.  We were completely overawed by the size.  The service was impeccable - nothing was too much trouble, although discreet and polite.  The pool was peaceful after the Jumeirah, although drinks were hideously expensive but we expected that.  We really did feel it was value for money as a treat.  The children loved the experience, and the sweet trolley that came round during the evening.","5","2014-05"
"25 stays and they still surprise me","I see a lot of people at BAA who have booked a cruise with one night in BAA, or a five-day stay in some Jumeirah hotel and one night in BAA. This creates the only disadvantage: in the entrance hall, you are being photographed all the time. 
Besides this, BAA is still truly number one in the world. This is my 25th stay now, and no matter I stay by myself, with friends, or my family: they always find something new to surprise me. Each time, no matter the type of suite, it looks like it was just refurbished.
Fluctuation of people is high, but not to the disadvantage of the hotel. Using it for business or vacation: if you have the money, do it! I have heard that some people live in BAA constantly since it opened, and yes, I would do so, if I had the funds :)
Please no whining about pricing and etiquette ... if you cannot spend 150 USD for a simple bottle of wine, then you are not the target group, and you might not enjoy the venue.","5","2014-06"
"WOW","I felt like a queen...This place took care of my every need.  The ambiance, the food and the surroundings and staff were well worth the price. Yes , it was pricey but if you can afford one night it is magic. we Loved everything and had lobster and fresh food  for all our meals.  I took my son for high school graduation and we loved every minute.  It was a trip of a life time...THe staff was amazing..i never opened a hotel door, elevator door..they knew my name, met me at the front door and took me to the airport in a huge mercedes..","5","2014-05"
"Amazing ,mouth watering view ,a 7 star experience","We have been there in the month of march in al muntaha restaurent ,during booking we have requested a window seat but unfortunately it was booked , but the staff somehow managed to provide the window seat during our deserts,the view was amazing ,staff was polite and helping ,window seat view was amazing and its onc ein a lifetime experience.must recommend worth going","5","2014-03"
"AMAZING!","Prices are commiserate with service... and yes they are both amazingly high!  This place was worth every cent!  Light bites and drinks were nearly $700 and yes I would do it all over again!  To see the city in this way is a must!

Dubai is an amazing place that you must experience on every level from the souk markets to the Burj Khalifa, top to bottom if you will.","5","2013-12"
"Afternoon tea","I went with my dauther and niece I don't have words to explain the excellent hotel , food , service and amazing view no wonder it is 7 starts, to many friends told me that it is one of the best hotel in the world and I agree with that","5","2014-06"
"amazing weekend","ive had the chance to use the facilities of the hotel for two days since my friend is staying there for 4 days ( I was there June 7-8). i never actually experienced the service when i first visited the hotel way back 2005. 

My friend told me it was worth every penny he paid since everybody was nice to him( mr. evans). On my part i enjoyed the beach most especially whenever the guys bring something to quench our thirst (lollies, fruits etc). Also, the pool on the 18th was awesome with its view and amenities.","5","2014-06"
"Unashamed Luxury","Picked up at the airport in an S400 Merc air conditioned bliss as it was 42C outside! Arrived at the Burj to be greeted by three costumed ladies offering dates cold towels and flowers. Check in was done discreetly by our lady escort who took us to the suite where all formalities were done. We had a Panoramic Suite on a corner with extensive views. Greeted by one of many personal butlers who were always at our beck and call. The suite was amazing. Gold is the predominant colour in the hotel and the suite was on two floors. A bottle of Louis Roederer greeted us. Outstanding areas of the suite were the mozaics in the huge bathroom, the bed which our butler assured us was the most comfortable in the world - and it was. Mirrors above the bed - say no more. It was all so wonderful we spent the whole day and night without leaving the hotel. Afternoon tea in the lobby was great and there are so many restaurants to choose from. We opted to dine in the suite. Yes it costs an arm and a leg but such luxury comes at a price and the service was so good with everyone knowing our name. Going back tomorrow night to try the restaurant on the top floor. Can't wait.","5","2014-06"
"Ultimate luxury","From start to finish this 7* hotel is jaw dropping. My stay was a surprise from my husband I was instantly wowed by the friendly staff who cater for your every need. Greeted at the hotel entrance accompanied to our floor and introduced to our butler. Who showed us round our two floor room. With the most amazing staircase. The room amenities are of the highest. We opted for in room dining which was served A le carte ..just wowed by all. Breakfast we opted for continental/far eastern. The chef was outstanding catering for us a selection of items prepared just for us. The hotels private beach is lovely ice box provided and the most comfortable sunbeds with plenty of shade for guests to use.  Overall what a stay certainly one I'll remember forever","5","2014-05"
"Amazing building, horrible service, no soul... not worth it.","""Well needless to say that the Hotel has an amazing facade. The building is beautiful and completely worth to see. Inside is crazy, lots of colors, a bit too much for the eye, but is something that you have to see at least once in your life. Super luxurious, lots of gold. Nice shops, top brands. Staff uniforms match all the hotel style and it gives that Arabic nights feeling. 
We booked for an afternoon tea at the Skybar. We were told that we should come 15 minutes before so we can ensure a window table. We arrived a bit earlier, so they didn’t even wanted us to go upstairs but we had to wait downstairs. No idea why. 10 minutes prior the booking they allow us to go up. We took the lift and reached another waiting area. We were about 20 people in that area, super crowded. They did another waiting list and a lot of people ended first than us, however we came first than everyone else. We had to wait for about 15 minutes. The restaurant was empty, all the staff just standing there doing nothing and all the guests standing in 10m2 area waiting. A bit unnecessary. I believe the staff thinks that they are doing us a favor so that basically we need to subject to their silly rules and policies. We got a window table, with luck. The food was OK, never 5 star level. Very normal in a coffee break in an event at a 4 star hotel. Nothing was special or luxurious. I got a fly in my champagne, they changed it right away but they wanted to charge me for it. Hello??? What was that all about. The waiter even said to me, yeah but we changed it. Well sorry, but that’s the minimum I believe. Staff is always trying to argue with you. 
Service was super normal, staff is not friendly. They are super arrogant and some even are not that well trained. And this comes from someone with wide experience in luxury service. 
Bill came, we wanted to split evenly in all the cards. We paid everything and apparently everything was fine but then I got a text message saying they did a second charge for something like 510AED extra. I was a bit surprised that they use your card without you being there. First, that’s not legal since I didn’t authorize it, second it’s not my problem if you didn’t charge the right amount from the beginning, train your staff better. We had to come back, then they were expecting for all of us to take the cards out AGAIN, reverse all the payment and pay again…. At the end we decided to go only with 2 cards to avoid further disasters. The person in charge, apparently the manager, didn’t have a clue how to use the Micros so basically we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a transaction that can take 3 minutes. Anyway…. 
I’m not sure if the restaurants are better, but avoid the afternoon tea. Is not worth the money. If you want to see the hotel from inside make an appointment in one of the shops, or a restaurants, maybe you will have better luck. If you want to see the view, for 150AED more you can get a 20 minute helicopter ride around the city and you can see the palm and world islands clearly. I would definitely choose that instead. I did it and that is absolutely worth every penny. 
They sent me the survey, which i filled, i got a reply back from the manager, copy paste sample, clearly. Better nothing. I asked them to please check on the refund of my card, and no one got back to me. What a service.""","1","2014-04"
"Afternoon Tea","Fantastic experience coming to the Burj for afternoon tea.  Yes the price seems steep but it is worth it as it pretty much is all you can eat so its not a case of once you have eaten the small portion of sandwiches then your done, they will keep topping you up.

Stunning building and while your in Dubai it is a must see even if just from the outside.

Booking in advance is essential or you will miss out !","5","2013-07"
"Aladin in the treasure Cave","We have stayed at Burj many times since it was opened ... The hotel hasn't lost any of its brilliance, impeccable service and attention to the guest details (except maybe the amenities in the bathroom wich have differed than when it first opened- Hermes toiletries in abundance and big sizes)... Always enjoyable and perfect... the suites are excellent two floor apartments that are ample for whatever you want to do... just superb...","5","2013-09"
"Everything you could want!","My second stay at this hotel, the 2 level suite was lovely, with a sea view.
Hermes toiletries in the bathroom is a wonderful touch.Pillow choice is also a great idea. The mini bar is very well stocked with anything you need. The butler service is great as is concierge. 
I love the decadence of the hotel and the sky bar is great for cocktails and people watching.all the resteraunts are great and choices are vast.
If I had to find a fault it would be the pool area can get cramped, but hey the beach is near,and well attended by the staff there who keep iced water topped up. Will be back. ","5","2014-01"
"Sky Tea at the Burj","I went for afternoon tea with a friend, it was on the 27th floor and gave fantastic views over Dubai.A little bit pricey but well worth every penny to get the chance to see inside this fabulous hotel. The seven course meal was amazing and was quite filling. The staff were very attentive and we were each given a small box of chocolates when we had finished. I would certainly recommend this experience. I'm going back to Dubai in September with my husband so hopefully we have another trip to the Burj ..","5","2014-06"
"Lunch at the Al Muntaha Restaurant","We were looking for a great place to enjoy lunch with a visitor and found it at the Al Muntaha Restaurant up high in the beautiful Burj Al Arab.
We have been there on several occasions in the nine years we have lived in Dubai, but this last experience outdid all previous ones. We usually go for the Friday Brunch, but timing did not work out this time, so we decided to eat a la carte on Saturday.
The staff in the restaurant is incredibly trained to anticipate your every need and made us feel most welcome.
The food was just plain delicious, we enjoyed every bite.
The icing on the cake was a beautiful long stemmed red rose that was given to me when we started to leave.","5","2014-06"
"Great for a special occassion","Went for a birthday afternoon tea. Staff were very attentive and a flower and small bday cake given out. Food was amazing and plentiful. views as always were great and thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon. Lots of other afternoon teas available in Dubai but if its a special treat then this is the place even if it is very pricey.... thank you!","5","2014-06"
"High Tea in the Lobby","We chose High Tea in the lobby so we could get a glimpse of inside this lovely hotel and this was the cheapest option! Unfortunately as we had children with us we couldn't have our High Tea in the Skybar right at the top of the hotel. Nevertheless, the experience was divine. From the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left, the service was exceptional and the ambience grand. I actually made a big mistake with our time as I had changed it but gotten mixed up so we arrived at 5pm instead of 3pm (and we had booked months in advance). However, there was no problem at all- they still seated us and served us as if nothing was wrong. The lobby is located on the ground floor and if you look up you see the unique centre of the hotel and all the balconies. The food was generous and excellent in every way. It takes about 2-2.5 hours so when we left it was dark and we didn't need dinner. The concierge asked where we were going on our way out and got the golf cart driver to take us to the nearby souk as desired. All very organised and friendly. Very refreshing!","5","2014-03"
"Highly recommend - what an experience ","Went for afternoon tea for my daughters birthday. Food was amazing, 7 wonderful courses, the steak was amazing! would highly recommend! The staff were very polite as was the overall experience. When we come back do Dubai would definitely come again. ","5","2014-06"
"Afternoon Tea","We have been to have afternoon tea at the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai during a 
recent visit. The service was attentive and we had a lovely table overlooking the sea.
The cuisine was excellent and this is one way of seeing this iconic hotel otherwise
one is not allowed to go in.","4","2014-05"
"The ultimate in luxury. A bucket list item","I have travelled considerably and thought I'd stayed in some luxury hotels, but this moved the bar to a whole new level. I was here as part of an incentive trip, and totally felt like a rockstar getting out of a Lamborghini to be greeted by the very friendly staff. Check-in was quick where I was introduced to Mohammed, who would be my butler for the next 3 days.

The room and view was if nothing else spectacular, with a gorgeous bath and shower, finished to the highest standard. The pillow menu was cause for a chuckle but no detail left out.

My only reservations were that the food possibly wasn't as 7 star as the setting, and the prices for drinks incredibly steep, but then you are in the worlds most luxurious hotel.

Would I come here again, yes, but again for a short stay. This is definitely one for the bucket list. Definitely an experience not to forget.","5","2013-07"
"WOW we had a surreal time","Everything was absolutely fabulous until the morning and breakfast at Bab al Yam - we could have been in a different hotel, a 2 or 3 star hotel.  It was a truly dreadful experience; the chef who boiled my egg had obviously missed his first day at chef school and couldn't even manage to boil an egg properly.  The choice was abysmal, nothing looked inviting or tempting and the room was ghastly.  It was quite weird seeing very glamorous people in such a setting.  To be fair we did have a choice of Asian or western breakfast maybe we should have chosen Asian??  Someone from management should go to this venue for breakfast in disguise and they would really be in for a shock.
This little problem would not stop me from going back to the Burj it’s a legend and rightly so – we had a fab time.","5","2014-05"
"Afternoon Tea at Burj Al Arab","A wonderful 7-star experience. A must do if one is visiting Dubai. Attentive
and efficient service; spectacular views; excellent cuisine; iconic building.  A long time dream fulfilled. Would go again and certainly recommend","5","2014-06"
"Outstanding Suites let down by food quality and drinks prices","My wife and I are used to staying in five star hotels and this is the finest hotel that we have stayed out the room quality is superb.
However I guess in a bid to keep the hotel elitist they have really ramped up the prices for food and drink. One glass of wine was £50 and a bottle of wine starts from around £150.  Champagne is £100 a glass.  My wife and I had two meals in the hotel and both were around £450, I expect outstanding service and food quality for £450 ( £225 each),  the service was good but not great and not the best ive had and the food quality was average for a five star hotel. 

The hotel is very small compared to other jumeirah hotels, I have stayed at jumeirah beach hotel and eaten and four others, I would say that you get good service in all jumeirah hotels and the price increase for the Burj just isn’t value for money. 
I guess you need to look at who is writing the review before you consider if this affects you, I paid £4500 for a two night stay at the Burj, it was a great experience but I could have had five nights at another Jumeriah hotel for that price.
The hotel is small if you are thinking about a break to this hotel,  I would recommend just two nights, maybe stay five nights at another Jumeriah hotel or have a look JA Palm tree court hotel for quarter  the price you get amazing service and you can book all inclusive options.
Summary, 
Magnificent suites, Good service good food, small hotel with only five restaurants and very very expensive drinks.  I would not recommend this hotel to friends unless you are very wealthy and can afford to waste money.   I class myself as well off staying only in five staff hotels but this just isn’t value for money and I won’t be going back.  I would go back to almost every other jumeriah hotel.  I can live with the price of the hotel rooms it’s the food and drink prices that leave a bitter hard done by taste in my mouth.","3","2014-05"
"Over the top but superb in everyday.....","This really is an amazing hotel, we spent a week here, it will not be to everyones taste but if you afford to stay here you really should indulge and experience life at The Burj.

Great food although expensive, Rolls Royce transfers and the most amazing duplex suite. This hotel has the wow factor","5","2014-04"
"Second stay even more impressive than the first","Celebrating a milestone birthday and there was really only one hotel to do it in. 

After first staying a couple of years ago and being overwhelmed by the place, the Burj had been on the list of places to return.

This time we were picked up by the Rolls Royce Phantoms - one for our daughters and one for us. I can highly recommend this mode of transport for an extra special touch, but however you choose to arrive, you cannot fail to be impressed with the personalised service that greets you on arrival.

After experiencing the ""standard"" rooms on our previous visit, we chose a Club Suite this time and this will now be our room of choice. Lazy hours were spent playing snooker at our own full size snooker table before a drink at our private bar. Breakfast was served at our own dining table for 8 with the Butlers on hand to serve each course and pour the drinks from the kitchen.
The Happy Birthday serenade by four of the Butlers before presenting a cake and bouquet of red roses was definitely a highlight. 

Another trip of a lifetime and more memories made to look back on in the years to come.","5","2014-05"
"nice place, if a little underwhelming","The decor we found was not to our taste, quite gaudy and blingy, lots of fountains indoors.  Its perfect for the arab market though.  They really tried to make the Burj better, more showy, more extravagant than the rest. But isn't that what Dubai is all about?
Its quite obvious but the muddled concoction just has a slightly underwhelming effect.

We ate here too, the restaurant was again quite gaudy, with blues and golds.  The food though, was amazing, can't complain.","5","2013-08"
"Exceptional Evening Out","I recently organised a night in the Al Muntaha Restaurant for my wifes birthday. The whole experience from booking through to completing the evening was 1st Class. I had arranged a Bespoke certificate to be sent home and that was recieved very quickly, I requested a Chauffeur driven Rolls Royce which was organised promptly, the staff from the entering the Hotel to exiting were attentive to our every need and the service for the Dinner was outstanding. For you food lovers out there this dinner is a must.
Thanks you to all the team involved in making this a most memorable experience for my Wife.","5","2014-05"
"Simply a Dream Come True","Since I first saw a documentary on the Burj not long after opening, I have always wanted to go to Dubai.   I just returned for the 5th time and finally got to stay at the Burj which was a dream come true and the top of my Bucket List.

We were collected in the Rolls Royce Phantom where we were greeted by Mohammed the driver who proudly presented me with a beautiful bunch of coloured roses.  He was incredibly friendly and offered a wealth of info on Dubai and landmarks that we passed by.  It's very cool to be given a music 'menu' to choose from!  lol 

On arrival at the Burj, a beautiful and lovely lady greeted us and guided us to our room.  Soon after, we were given the tour of the room and it's features.  When we were left alone, we walked around in sheer awe - it was even better than the pictures and videos we'd seen.  Absolute jaw-dropping luxury.   From the remote controlled door, curtains and butler service, to the fully-equipped office complete with Apple Mac, to the amazing main bathroom stocked with full-sized Hermes products and a spectacular spa - everything was just stunning.  We were going to spend every single moment enjoying this room.   

We enjoyed a couple of cocktails at the Skyview Bar prior to dinner.   As usual the service was great.  I was stoked to see a cocktail based on The Big Bang Theory tv show!

At dinner we dined at Bab AlYam which was good.  At the end of our meal, the staff presented hubby with a beautiful birthday cake and sang Happy Birthday which was such a lovely and unexpected gesture (although we were so full from dinner we had them box it for us to take back to our room).    Not long after we returned to our room, room service arrived and wheeled in another (different) birthday cake, a beautiful bunch of roses and a birthday card signed by the GM.   We were so ecstatic and humbled - what a great memory of our stay.

In summary, the Burj far exceeded our expectations and we hope to stay again some day - it will forever hold a special place in my heart. 

P.S - we took both birthday cakes with us and spent the next 4 days eating them at Atlantis ... they were both to die for!  Thanks everyone at the Burj!","5","2014-05"
"Close to paradise","We´ve spend our wedding anniversary at the 27th floor at Al Muntaha-Restaurant. The whole atmosphere were overwelming and the service abolute perfect. The food was great: For special occasions the best location you can find in the world.","5","2014-05"
"Outstanding Visit!","The hotel was beautiful and the views outstanding.  The service cannot be outdone.  The private beach was very relaxing and swimming in the arabian sea was great.  We stayed in one of the panoramic suites and now i have been spoiled to where i would have to get that room everytime! Floor to ceiling windows with views of the city as well as the palm were gorgeous.  The moonlight romantic swim package was worth every penny along with the time with the sweetie.  All around a great stay and worth doing at least once through dubai.","5","2014-04"
"Incredible View, Friendly Service, Great Drinks & Food","The Skyview Bar is the place to be.  The view is incredible, floor to ceiling glass walls.  Service is great, people are extremely friendly, food is terrific.  It is pricey but a must do if you are in Dubai.  You need to make reservations in advance or you will not be allowed into the property.  It fills up so make sure you call them a few days ahead of when you plan to go.","5","2014-05"
"I hope to revisit the Burj towards the end of this summer. It's totally first class.","This hotel is the best in the world. Once you enter the hotel it just takes your breath away. The staff are excellent. You have your own butler. You are treated like kings and queens. We have stayed many times at this hotel and hope to return late summer. Words cannot describe it. Treat yourself to this hotel and you will not be disappointed.","5","2013-08"
"Outstanding afternoon tea","The service was faultless, the food was faultless, the view was faultless. We really enjoyed our experience here.

Only thing I would mention is that the afternoon tea price has increased in the last 6 months by about £15 each which makes what is already a costly afternoon tea even more costly. I'm not sure how the hotel can justify around 20% increase and the price it is now does put us off from returning.","5","2014-05"
"Amazing, got to be done !","We visited the Burj for my birthday, drinks in the skyview bar followed by dinner in al Mahara (aquarium one) absolutely fabulous, staff amazing, unpretentious, pay for what you get. 
Views from skyview bar unbeatable, nuts, hors d'oeuvres come with so added value, spend time enjoying the foyer fountains, aquarium etc - so much to rave about it's the worlds only 7 star hotel you HAVE to experience it. We thought it a one off experience but... Actually I want to go again NOW! Thank you Burj for a fantastic birthday memory. ","5","2014-04"
"amazing","Dubai has many attractions for young and old alike. I traveled to Dubai with friends. One of the attractions is Burj Al Arab, the only 7star in the wold. The outside view of hotel is amazing and the location is perfect. We went there for dinner. We were amazed when we had entered the lobby. There are a lot of things to praise about this place.  Their dinner buffet was well spread with excellent choices for everyone. Undoubtly a must visit place in Dubai if it suites your pocket.","5","2014-03"
"Incredible hotel!","Wow! It takes a lot to impress us, but this hotel managed it, almost entirely due to the suite itself. We had a double height lounge with panoramic full height windows looking along the coast to the city. We had a separate dining room, study, large lavish bedroom, epic marble bathroom with wall murals and, best of all, a snooker room with full size snooker table!! The room came with its own private butler and the service was faultless but discreet. Everything about the room was very high quality from the deep pile carpets to the complimentary Hermes toiletries. We had breakfast in the top floor restaurant one morning and it was nice, but not as opulent as we were expecting. We finished off our stay with Rolls Royce Silver Shadow transfers back to the airport, have never turned as many heads arriving at an airport! Overall, the room made the experience and when you're paying that much for one make the most of it - we invited friend around in the evening - as they're really very special.","5","2013-06"
"Great high tea","We went to Burj to have high tea in the afternoon. The hotel lobby is quite unique and amazing. An appointment is required for high tea in advance in the skybar. You have to go up on an escalator before you take the elevator to the 27th floor and treated to an amazing view.  The elevator faces the gulf and provides quite excellent views. The selection of teas is quite substantial. There is a 3-4 course menu.  The sandwiches and sweets selections were great. We were given a small box of sweets to take home. Take a lot of pictures. It did get a little warm in the skyview bar in the late afternoon. Overall a great experience! Service was outstanding.","5","2014-05"
"Sky view bar","Went to sky view bar for afternoon tea , the whole experience was amazing, recommend that you go, yes it's a little expensive but it's worth it , the view, the food, the service and the staff all very good, it's not every day you get to go in to a 7* hotel , so you might as well spend that little extra as it's worth it, we done the 560 AED which included a glass of champagne","4","2014-05"
"Extravagant Hotel, Didnt Stay There Tho.","First Of is Really good just to go,see and have a taste of a 7* Hotel. The aquarium located inside the reception is simple huge and amazing,including many kinds of salt fish, sharks and many other.You can Have Ice-Cream or Coffe, and if you have the money you can stay there.

This Hotel is The Icon Of Lavish.","5","2013-06"
"Out of this world","Whilst visiting dubai recently, we  made a lunch reservation prior to our holiday at this hotel for our wedding anniversary. We had a lovely personal service, the best table was reserved for us overlooking the sea and beach, red rose petals in the shape of a heart were placed on the table and a personal cake was presented at the end of our delicious meal. Would recommend a vist whilst in dubai. Thank you for your hospitality","5","2014-05"
"Superb!","We visited the Burj for afternoon tea whilst on our honeymoon, and it has been on my husbands bucket list ever since it was complete. To say we were amazed would be an understatement! The inside is just beautiful and we spent a while watching the aquarium in reception and the dancing fountains. We had a lovely seat on the first floor by the window overlooking the beach and had a personal waiter serving us, who went above and beyond to ensure we had an enjoyable visit. The afternoon tea consisted of 7 courses, with cakes, sandwiches, fresh fruit, scones, steak and mash and pastries as well as a number of cold and hot drinks. Every course was wonderful and the food was indescribable. The waiter presented us with a gift each to swap since we were celebrating and congratulated us on our marriage, which was nice. Love it, can't wait to go back! ","5","2014-04"
"Amazing!","Super chilled, super service, super exclusive, super food, super views.  Excellent!  However, yes it is very expensive but it's a great treat.  The pool is nice but the ambiance and the view are the best part of the hotel.  Due to the minimum spend and access control to the island it is not heaving with people.  I loved it.  The decor is very OTT but they get away with it.  I attended a function in the ball room at the top.  It was superb and you just feel like a VIP the whole time.","5","2014-04"
"Average","By my personal expirience they want to show so much they have 7 stars that they overwhelm you with to much service. Food was super average but when it comes to luxury and amazing your eyeseight they got it right!","3","2013-06"
"just beautiful","an amazing experience........didnt want to leave!
the restaurants were out of this world, nothing was too much trouble and the service was second to none.
luxurious rooms with beautiful views
might even take the children next time!","5","2014-05"
"A hotel is truly great when it not only is the means to discover a destination but becomes a destination in itself!","

 I am currently (and sadly) winding down a 2 week stay at the Burj. Not only is the hotel's hard product (rooms /facilities) exceptional but it's soft product (service) is unmatched! Take this from an avid, luxury, 5 star, first class world traveler. I have literally only been outside the hotel (not counting my daily trips to the in house water park) 3 times. You will truly feel that the Burj has become your second home. Reflecting on my trip, I can honestly say that for me the Burj al Arab has become a destination in itself!","5","2014-05"
"Fantastic experience!","Excellent food, excelent atmosphere, beautiful view, fantastic service. but is is very expensive and I won´t repeat the experience although I loved it. we had lunch in 4 diferente restaurant inside Burj Al Arab and we enjoyed each one.","5","2014-04"
"a small snag in the beginning but great after","When pulling up to the hotel it really is amazingly beautiful.  We had rented a car from the airport so we pulled up to the security gate by ourselves.  The security guard did question us quite a bit until he realized we were trying to check in, then was very friendly and let us in.  We proceeded to the entrance where we were greeted by name and walked inside.  Since we arrived at 8:30 am I was very shocked that they told us our room was ready!  We were escorted up to our room and wow was it gorgeous!  All was going great until the lady doing my in room check in had the incorrect rate on the paperwork.  This wouldn't have been a big deal had she left and said she would correct it before we check out.  Instead, for at least 20-25 mins she was in and out of the room asking me for emails from their own reservation department of the rate I was given, interrupting the butlers room introduction, and stressing us out after a 16 hour flight.  Luckily I had the emails they sent me saved on my phone so I was able to get the correct rate.  To be honest, I do not think I should have been involved in their mistake or having to prove myself when their paperwork was incorrect.  

Moving on, the butler finished his introduction and our luggage was brought in.  Everything was great from the 83,000 dirham bed to the full size hermes toiletries.  We did receive a cake, rose bouquet, and lovely letter from the resort for our honeymoon which was a very nice gesture.  I had no other issues than checking in and found the staff to be very friendly.  This resort would have received 5 stars without that minor hiccup.  However, when a resort is supposed to be ""7 stars"" that should never happen.","4","2014-05"
"Deserves it status as no1 place to stay!","As a frequent visitor to Dubai with children we always stay at JBH but we treated ourselves to a luxury weekend away sans children... The choice of where to go/ stay was simple.. The Burj Al Arab, and what an amazing place it is. I'm not even sure where to start as from
top to bottom, start to finish it is both luxury and service at its highest. From the warm greeting received everywhere to the "" nothing is too much trouble"", from The Butler. The view from our 20th floor suite was breathtaking, by simply
pressing the "" open curtain"" button from the tv remote whilst laying in bed, revealing the aqua water and bright blue, cloudless sky. What a way to wake up( don't get this in Kent)! Breakfast was as expected a quality, fresh tasting variety of everything every nationality could want without the hustle and bustle of other hotels. Wherever our evening had taken us,(360/Amal/pierchic/ivy-see reviews), we always ended the night with a swift cocktail at the Skybar coupled with those delicious nuts and olives( hence extra half stone onto my size 8).The day was spent by the exec pool at JBH, the same as we would have spent it if children were here too, where service here is also as ever, great.","5","2014-05"
"Very disappointing.","We booked in advance and visited the Skyview Bar for afternoon tea and considering the high cost of around £80.00 and the 7 star rating of the the hotel we were very disappointed by the experience. On arriving in a taxi no one from the hotel opened the taxi door or welcomed us to the hotel. It was left to us to approach a staff member to ask where the Skyview bar was and as we were early we had to wait in the lobby area with crowds of tourists taking pictures of the structure. I noted that the carpets by the lift were worn and stained. On entering the Skyview  Bar we were requested to wait in a small holding area lobby, standing shoulder to shoulder with other people. There were only 2 seats available. The bar itself was nicely appointed and we had a nice table by the window with a lovely vieiw .The food was disappointing. I did not like the fillings in the sandwiches and also found them to be too cold, as if pre made for some time. I asked the waiter if it would be possible to have some plain  sandwiches ie beef without the spicy jelly but it seemed that the waiter did either not understand the request or it was just not possible to make different sandwiches. Also we found the small cakes too sweet and the scones small and dry. For the first 20 minutes of the meal the receptionist held a loud telephone conversation at the desk regarding some booking problem and I felt that she should of transferred the call away from the area where we were sitting. When we left the hotel I asked the hotel receptionist where we could find the hotel buggy that I had read about on Trip Advisor, to go to the 360 bar and I was informed that this was only for guests staying in the hotel and that we should get a taxi. There was no offer to find us a taxi or advice that a taxi would not be able to drive all the way to the bar- as we found out later. I was sent a questionnaire by the hotel and I completed this  to advise them of the issues I had. I then received a reply that the comments would be investigated and I would be contacted. However I was not contacted and therefore I emailed the hotel and received a copy of an email that the hotel said had been sent to me advising that they were sorry that I did not enjoy the experience and offering me 2 flutes of champagne should I return to the hotel. The reply did not address the specific comments I had made and we would not return to the hotel .","2","2014-03"
"Burj Al Arab Skyview Bar - Highly recommend the High Tea","A special occassion visit to Dubai should include afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar. Book well in advance and bring a copy of your booking so the security guard will let you onto the property. A unique experience with very well trained friendly staff all over the hotel. Best view is the window table second from the corner. Go early as no bookings taken for window tables. Nothing was too much trouble. The high tea was fab fab fab and catered well for our allergies. Compliments to the kitchen staff. No dinner required afterwards. The toilets were exceptionally clean and Hermes hand lotion provided which was a nice touch. Do go to the gift shop downstairs on the way out. You will pick up a nice Burj Al Arab souvenier like the special gold threaded ornaments for your Xmas tree which are only available at this hotel. I was given a lovely delicious birthday cake, a red rose and a box of petit fours to take home. Will be back again.","5","2014-04"
"High Tea in Skyview Bar a Must-Do!","High tea at the Burj al Arab Skyview Bar on the 27th floor is a must-do.  Be sure and make reservations, and bring your confirmation sheet as you cannot enter the hotel grounds without it.  We were a little early for our 4pm reservation, but they suggested that we walk around and take pictures if we'd like.  The hotel lobby is gorgeous with real gold gilded everywhere and an aquarium and fountains by the escaltors.  The high tea experience was fun and each course was fabulous.  Single dishes were served and then tiers of food, all delicious.  Even the teas were excellent and we tried four different ones from the 'wellness' section of an extensive tea/coffee list.  So, if you don't want tea there are other options.  We had plenty to eat, but you can have as much as you like apparently.  As were were in Dubai to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we were given a lovely red rose and chocolate cake (see pic).  Lots of folks celebrating something as nearly everyone seemed to get the rose.  At the end of the meal, we were given a nice box of chocolates to take home.","5","2014-05"
"A Special Experience","We were visiting Dubai on a 3 day stopover on the way to New Zealand and whilst it was different than we expected the things we did  including our Afternoon Tea at Burj Al Arab all lived up to expectations. We had read varying reviews but it was great to be dropped at the hotel after a drive round Dubai with our private car tour guide. We had a little time to wait so sat in the lounge listening to the music playing whilst absorbing the opulence of the interior of the hotel. At our allocated time we booked the 4pm Afternoon Tea so we could see the sunset across the Palm we went up to the Skyview Bar where we were given a window table with a lovely view. The service of the staff made you feel special. The menu was all explained in detail and beutifully presented, the food all served on a cake stand in the same sail shape as the hotel. We were not rushed and never had to ask for anything the staff were most attentive and as it was our anniversary we were presented with a box of fancies and a rose to take away. A most memorable afternoon and we had had plenty to eat so did not need dinner. It is worth the money for the experience, I highly recommend it.","5","2014-01"
"Highly recommended - great way to start any trip to Dubai!","I went to the BAA Skyview Bar High Tea and it was incredible! Amazing food, great service, and spectacular views! For the equivalent of about $170 AUD it was a great afternoon well spent. Don't forget to book in advance! The bar had it all - the food was incredible, drinks freeflowing, and we even saw a couple of celebrities. Amazing!","5","2014-04"
"Great hotel, great staff, great stay!","Everything! The staff were very friendly, courteous, knowledgeable & polite, it's so nice to be greeted by your name! The suite was fabulous and the views were awesome. Had a great stay!!

Quality of facial tissues in the suite.They were quite harsh on the skin, would have expected soft tissues. Kitchen was very ill equipped,ie no crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils etc.","5","2013-12"
"Something Special - A Very Impressive Hotel","Exceptional hotel with excellent service. Very spacious rooms.  We particularly liked the cocktail lounge overlooking Dubai.

Could not fault it.  Stayed there for a few days with friends on a stop over.","5","2013-08"
"Al Mahara Restaurant - Exceptional","Al Mahara is a wonderful restaurant. Excellent menu and stunning wine list. Courteous, attentive and really helpful staff. And watching the plethora of fish swim by is an experience not be missed. Cary Martin, London.","5","2014-04"
"Awesome","I´d visit in april-14 the skyview bar and Al Mahara restarurant, both are excellents, excellent service, with a smile on their face resolve everything you need, make you fell like a queen, highly recommended","5","2014-04"
"Afternoon tea in the Skyview Bar","We had a wonderful afternoon tea in the Skyview Bar. I would definitely recommend it. Champagne and as much tea as we could drink......I've never seen so many varieties.The food tasted wonderful and was presented beautifully. The service was very good.Expensive afternoon out but totally worth it. We were made to feel like royalty and I would definitely go back or recommend it to others. The view is spectacular. And the interior of the hotel is awesome.","5","2014-04"
"Disappointing","From the outside a stunning looking hotel, not too bad on the inside for that matter. Unfortunately the friendliness and knowledge of the staff leaves a lot to be desired. Some were bordering on rude. Considering this is supposed to be one of the top hotels in the world I was very under whelmed. Had breakfast there and for the exorbitant amount charged I expected a lot better than what was offered. Worth a visit but only to say you've been there...","2","2014-04"
"PERFECT","My short stay here was just perfect,if only everyday life was this grand.The decor,staff and the meals are all wonderful. If i could retire then this would make a perfect way to enjoy the rest of my life as a KING.","5","2014-05"
"Dubai Glamour","I have stayed at the Burj Al Arab four times. My stays have been for two nights each way. I stayed there in 2009 and 2010. The Burj is glamorous and sophisticated. 

Get the hotel limo service to pick you up from the airport. For US$200 they send their Major Domo to greet you at the plane. He escorts you to baggage where he collects your luggage and then he puts you through the VIP line at customs and immigration. You are then whisked away to your awaiting limo and driven to the hotel.

Experience is what life is all about.  From the double story suites (gay couples are given two bedroom suites. Once we received an upgrade to the Emirates Suite; 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, living room, dining room, office, cocktail bar and lift between the two floors ), the glamorous furnishings (everything that is gold coloured, is real gold), the 24 hour butler service, the Hermes bathroom products and colognes.....and the list could go on. The indoor swimming pool is on the 44th floor (remember, one floor is actually two floors) and overlooks Dubai. Breathtaking.The breakfast is unbelievable. Dinner in the underwater restaurant is delicious but expensive. Not for the faint-hearted. But the fish tank must be seen to believed. A jacket must be worn or it will be supplied. The room key (a leather wallet) gives you access to any other property owned by the family that own the Burj. I suggest a boat trip on a motor launch that can be arranged by the hotel. Mind you, we also rented the hotels Rolls Royce Phantom, driver and guide for a tour around Dubai. A very special experience.  The Burj Al Arab. Well worth the experience.","5","2013-08"
"Excellent Teatime at Burj Al Arab","Very good value,excellent service, very nice view.
We had teatime in the Sky View Bar located on the 27th floor.
Snacks are of very good quality. For us it was not really clear which drinks were included.
We are going to return on our next visit.","5","2014-04"
"Afternoon Tea…Nothing Special!","We were looking forward to a very special treat of Afternoon Tea in the Skyview Bar at the Burj Al Arab and certainly do not mind paying for something that is a once in a life-time opportunity and a special occasion.  We found the experience somewhat disappointing overall and overpriced for what you receive and experience.  The Sky View bar looks a bit dated and worn, even the bathroom facilities were nothing to write home about and the taps and sinks could do with a jolly good deep clean.  The view is good, but not as spectacular as the view from the Burj Khalifa and the temperature of the room was very hot and it did not seem the air conditioning was working.  The staff are attentive although our waiter's command of English was very poor and we struggled to understand him and we had to ask more than once for more tea and just a glass of water.  We were not particularly enamoured with the food and found the sandwiches and savoury items to not feel or taste very fresh.  It was all very cold, hard and dry and the fillings were really nondescript.  The sweet selection of cakes and pastries was pretty much the same and rather disappointing.  Maybe it had all been kept at too low a temperature or for too long in the refrigerator.  In all, the whole Afternoon Tea experience was just okay and nothing special, I have had much better in London hotels and even small country tea rooms locally.  The hotel areas we were allowed to see such as the lobby and reception area is opulent and impressive, it is just a shame the experience we had did not match up to that or meet our expectations.  Would we recommend or repeat the experience? No, I would say save your hard earned money for something else that is better value and more enjoyable.","3","2014-04"
"The best dinner","I only had the pleasure to have dinner in the Burj Al Arab, and what an experience it was! The staff were very friendly, the whole place is a once in a lifetime experience. The dinner was at one of the restaurants on the 22nd floor, we had an amazing night view of Dubai from up there. 

I had a 6 course set meal for dinner, which was expensive but well worth it! it contained the likes of scallops, duck and veal. I recommend anyone who visits Dubai to go here and taste the lifestyle.","5","2013-06"
"Worth every penny","Booked a meal in the Arabian restaurant, had pre dinner drinks in the 1st floor bar, fantastic meal and then up to the sky bar. Fantastic experience, the staff looked after us like royalty. Only 1 negative is the sky bar needs a make over. Will return on our next visit . ","5","2014-05"
"unforgetable lifetime experience, but..","This is a difficult review, and one shouldn't choose to live or not live in this hotel solely based on people's review. This is an experience to have, but given the price one is paying, there are things that I just can't give it a 5 star.

I will skip all of the goodness of this place and just focus on a few negatives.
1. SOOOO many tourists. You can't get in or out of lobby without running into groups of tourists and fight your way in/out of the lobby.
2. Billing accuracy needs to be improved. The bill I get from restaurant and final bill often don't align.
3. Restaurant food is good and I can only give it a 4 star comparing with the price I pay.","4","2014-04"
"A bucket list stay...","We stayed there for our honeymoon, from the beginning the service was amazing, they welcome you at every step of the check inn process and have a personal butler for each floor. The restaurants for breakfast were pretty good, we never had lunch there, but for dinner I would recommend eating outside the hotel, or at other Jumeirah hotels inside the same group, the ones in the Burj Al Arab are not worth it, they are very expensive, service is poor, and food regular, maybe I would recommend it only for the experience but be prepared... the ones we tried outside the hotel were way much better, the ones in the Medinat are really good. 
When you are there you have to try all the pools, the one in the 18 floor, or I don't remember in which one, is worth the visit.","5","2013-07"
"Reassuringly expensive!","This was a ""bucket list"" stay for two nights in April. I had promised myself a visit here since the hotel opened and a family holiday to Abu Dhabi for a week provided the perfect opportunity.

I doubt anybody stays here without fully researching the hotel, and all the superlatives have been expressed many times. It was my sons 11th birthday and he was more excited than we were to be staying here, even if it was only for two nights. Driving up to the security point I showed the guard our booking which he seemed to think was a restaurant reservation and suggested we were too early! It was only 30 minutes before standard check-in time so I asked him what he suggested we do? He then seemed to overcome his confusion and apologized as he waved us through. Security is obviously at the forefront here and I expect some of the regular  guests  find that reassuring and necessary.

Our rented Avis Toyota Landcruiser was unloaded and hastily valeted away to some part of the underground structure, where its impertinence would not offend the Rolls Royce's, Ferraris and Lamborghini's with more visible parking arrangements. We were greeted at the entrance and ushered into a side annex for 5 minutes or so before being escorted up to our suite on the 13th floor. Here we were introduced to our butlers and then taken into the suite for the completion of the check-in formalities. 

Although you know what to expect, it is still a jaw dropping ""wow"" moment as you survey the suite and all it has to offer. This was the ""basic"" deluxe suite, but I would have been happy to live out the rest of my days in it. Sadly my bank balance would have expired long before I did. The room key (my son is a keen collector of such things) was  simply a blank white plastic card (no doubt for security) but presented in a lovely small leather credit card holder. 

The suite is just wow! By that I mean WOW! I started to feel like a James Bond villain behind my desk with all the high tech equipment and the rising TV in the bedroom. All that was missing was the white Persian cat and of course my ransom demand for one billion dollars!  In fact the ransom would have been partially useful in settling the room bill on departure. A coke from the minibar will set you back £8. However this will soon seem a bargain. I think the hotel would describe the prices as ""reassuringly expensive"" and I am sure that is right.

The butlers on our floor were absolutely fantastic and although I suspect some face recognition technology was employed whenever we approached the reception desk on our floor, they never failed to greet us enthusiastically every time we approached. On the last evening they arranged a guitar serenade complete with birthday cake, non alcoholic sparkling wine, card, and canapés to celebrate my sons birthday. He (and we) were completely blown away by this.

Breakfast (which was included) was without doubt the best buffet breakfast I have ever eaten anywhere. Gulf shrimp, Tasmanian Salmon, Exotic fruits. Everything was delicious. We ate dinner in Al Muntaha (the restaurant at the top) on the 27th floor. The table was by a window with views out towards the Palm. The service and the food was excellent. The bill was as high as the view, but again reassuringly so!  

The staff in the hotel were all great, but special mention for the butlers on the 13th floor particularly Paulo who arranged a tour of one of the Presidential suites for us. As great as that suite was, it was really only a larger version of what we already had. If I ever become president of a small nation or indeed a James Bond villain, then I would book it without hesitation. 

The ladies on the pool level reception always greeted us with a smile and insisted on finding out whether we were going to breakfast, the pool or the beach, so that they could facilitate seeing to our every need. Clearly they had us mistaken for one of the celebrity guests. That is certainly the way it felt.

The private beach area across the causeway was lovely. An attendant (of course) escorts you to your sunbeds and arranges a cool box full of ever replenished water to be at your side at all times. Cold towels are provided regularly. As lovely as it was to lie on the white sand beach or wade in the azure blue sea and look up at the impressive and imposing structure of the hotel, you couldn't help but feel you should really be back in your suite lapping up the luxury of every minute available to you. 

If this hotel is on your ""bucket list"" do it at least once. The trouble is that it will spoil you, and once probably won't be enough.","5","2014-04"
"DisneyWorld meets Vegas at a Hyatt on steroids, plus surveillance!","This is a very difficult review to do. I have a love/hate complex with this place. And we went out of our way to do the full BAA experience - arrived from the airport by helicopter on the roof, stayed in a ""panoramic one bedroom suite"", rented a Ferrari 458 Italia, ate at 4 of the restaurants, had drinks in the rooftop bar, did the spa thing, etc etc, so we gave it every chance. And ended up conflicted about the whole thing

 On the one hand, the place is everything it seems to be from a distance - incredibly, awesomely beautiful (on the outside), with a genuine effort by all staff to be hospitable, and with some stunning public interior spaces. On the other hand, the decor is kind of hideous - think Vegas bordello meets Arab harem tent - complete with a mirror on the ceiling over the bed and gold, blue, orange and red the predominant colors. After a while you wish for black and white for sure. And the bathrooms are this sort of ridiculous marble and gold concoction with mirrors everywhere, which is good for narcissists, but can be rough first thing in the morning!

And coloring everything was something I for sure didn't expect - the place is 75% occupied by families with young children. Amazing, at the prices!! Thus the Disney reference, and the sense that the BAA is as much a theme park as 5 (or 7) star hotel.  The lobby is a constant scene of tourists snapping photos (they get bused in, it seems), and the gate at the entrance to the causeway actually has people crowding around to see who goes in and out (tho our Ferrari was helpful here!!). So there's a strange informality and touristy aspect to the place unlike what you'd hope to find at one of the world's best hotels. I'd certainly never stay here on business, for example

But, but, but....It's hard to get over the sheer beauty of the exterior architecture, or the views from inside. And the beach experience (a temporary place near the Jumeriah Beach hotel) is very nice - comfortable lounges, great water, good service, and the BAA itself floating above everything as if in a dream. And it is nice, in theory and mostly in pracitce, to have ""7-star service"". We had all of our needs taken care of, including the drying of bathing suits, rapid laundry turn-arounds, and ben a paramedic arriving in the room when my companion had some stomach discomfort.

But, there are some jarring and annoying aspects to the BAA. For instance, in the spa/gym, if you use 'special' equipment there is an additional fee! But a special note must go to the 'butler' service on each floor. Yes, they are there 24/7, but that also means that every time you enter or exit your room, the monitors and cameras at their desk near the elevators track your movements, and the butlers swoop in to ask you how you are doing. Nice in theory, but amazingly intrusive and actually unnerving in practice. A little like being in a police state, in fact.

The restaurant food was pretty good, but, again, the scenes are very touristy, not elegant. Eg not 5-star.

On last thing that was not technically the hotel's fault, but which I feel they could have alerted me to: The Ferrari rental people (arranged through the BAA concierge) do not tell you that in Dubai there are traffic cameras on every road and at every intersection, and that these cameras issue automatic speeding tickets! YIKES!  We'e in a Ferrari and we can't speed?  Unfortunately, We did not know that in advance, and we indeed did speed!  To, it turned out, the tune of $1550.00 in traffic fines for a one day rental!!!  now, I have had Ferraris elsewhere, and nowhere did this ever occur. In fact, in, say, Vegas, you are told to drive the car ""like it's meant to be driven"". While we were clearly guilty, and did of course pay the fines, the whole thing was distinctly unpleasant, and the BAA might have given us a heads-up, as the rental had been arranged weeks in advance

So, the surveilance/police state thing really left a bad taste - butlers plus computers plus cameras constantly following you around. Moscow, where we were in March, was less intrusive. And they had armed guards and metal detectors at the entrance to the Ritz...","4","2014-04"
"Beautiful but service level does not match the beauty","The suites at this hotel will take your breath away as will the views.  Unfortunately the service at the hotel does not match the beauty.  Encountered several disappointments during our stay when dealing with the staff. Probably will not stay here on my next trip as a result","4","2014-04"
"Worth it for the experience","Its great to go once to experience, but wouldn't recommend for a long holiday. The rooms are amazing, the butler outside your door is a little intrusive, but service is great, but be prepared for the bill","4","2013-05"
"Great experience","Wow!  Went for afternoon tea in the sky lounge which is on the 27th floor.  Would definitely recommend this.  From the moment you enter this hotel it's luxury, gold everywhere.  The afternoon tea was great.  Shortbread and strawberries on arrival followed by a selection of sandwiches on different types of bread and rolls followed by beef, mashed potatoes and a mustard sauce then a cake selection, tea or coffee( again huge selection of teas and coffee.","5","2014-04"
"Sky Tea at the Skyview Bar","The Burj Al Arab is a hotel that normally is not for ""normal"" people because its a 7star hotel and way to expensive to stay there for a night or more. The only way to see this beautiful hotel from the inside is to do the Sky Tea at the Skyview Bar on the 27th floor. That's what I did too, It's not cheap as you will understand in a hotel like this but it was really worth it. The people are very nice and the food was good. We had a table for 2 at one of the most wonderful spaces their are in that restaurant. The view was at the Jumeira hotel and the harbor. So nice to see. I asked for a table next to window but at the reservation they said that they could not promise me. I think when you book this long before you go and ask for it, you have a bigger chance to get it. It started at 16:00 hours and we left at 18:15 hours. But they did not rush you. You can arrive half an hour earlier so you can make pictures of the out- and inside of the hotel.","5","2014-04"
"Junsu Bar is the best","f you are in Dubai I would highly recommend to admire this Hotel , a true masterpiece of modern architecture.
To get close to the building is required to be guests of the Hotel. I advise you to book a cocktail at Bar Junsu. It 'a space inside the Burj Al Arab, with the ceiling studded with thousands of crystals Swaronski effect Milky Way. The young Prasad will serve present and aperitifs oriental flavor.","5","2014-04"
"Evening Cocktails","A fantastic evening we had with friends, I have read a couple of reports about afternoon tea here not being anything special (& a friends view) so booked cocktails, there is a minimum spend, just turning up is an event! supercars - including a titanium Rolls Royce on parade, (you do need a booking to just get past the security barrier to let you on the island), make sure you bring your print out of it, I booked direct and had to change my booking a couple of times & the reply's where dealt with within a few hours  with no mistakes, the ambience is amazing, our waiter was very polite - background jazz playing, and cocktails fantastic night. Will go back there one day. (perhaps for afternoon tea so I can make my own mind up!), An amazing place!","5","2014-03"
"What can I say? It is 7 stars!","It is grand, grand and grand from beginning to the end! They even give you Hermes toiletries. Food was superb! Actinides for kids nearby at wild wadi was joyful. Security was tight. They screen everyone coming in and out. Our room is like double storey house! Huge and grand! Everything is gold plated. We had a corner suite and the view is insane. We could see the palm islands and beyond.","5","2013-05"
"Afternoon tea","I was lucky enough to experience afternoon tea in the Burj al Arab and I can safely say the experience was amazing! Everything from the food to the service to the general atmosphere were fantastic! Definitely a treat worth experiencing I will certainly be recommending! ","5","2014-04"
"Excellent experience!","It is not just a hotel, it is an experience. At least one should stay here once in a life time! Our family had a wonderful stay in this superior hotel. Everything was perfect at this place, the rooms, restaurants, facilities and the people. We will never forget this wonderful experience.","5","2013-12"
"Skyline Bar","Lovely bar and the cocktails were amazing. I would definelty recommend the Mr Big Cosmo!!! We decided to order some food too which was good when it came. I think they forgot about our order. The waiter apologised though. I also mentioned this on the review sent from the hotel after our experience. Which they promptly replied with a personal apology. Definelty a must do if you are in Dubai to say you have been and to see it.","5","2014-02"
"High Tea - disappointed by service","Burj Al Arab has always been a very special treat for me when I visit Dubai. This time I booked High Tea for two. The setting was beautiful and we were seating by the window as per my request. Food and drinks were great, but we were very unlucky with the service. My daughter's drink was spilled on the table and it was taken away although she did not finish it. No replacement brought it. They have forgotten to bring our cocktails with the second course. The drinks were simply left on a side at the waiters table for about 15 min and, when I pointed out that I saw them there while on the way to the bathroom, our cocktails were brought in but the ice was melted and they were simply not good. I had to ask to bring a freshly made one. Then the tea arrived much later than French pastries. Everything took a long time although the hostesses were pleasant and polite. I was disappointed by the whole experience and would give it 3* for service, compared to my previous visits when the service was absolutely impeccable. I wanted to give my daughter a true Burj experience on our last evening in Dubai and it was slightly spoilt by poor service level.","4","2014-04"
"Magic experience brunch at the Burj Al Arab","We visited Dubai and had on Sunday brunch at the Burj Al Arab hotel in their restaurant located on the 27th floor. We arrived at the hotel, car valet service was available, we could visit the hotel and than with a great view of the Palm we moved on the lift to the restaurant. the fodd was of the biggest variety experiences so far, great service and wonderful views. if you visit Dubai take this option it is the value worth.","5","2014-04"
"Afternoon tea - wish I could have stayed","Afternoon tea was a real experience: couldn't fault anything. Everything was high quality and service to match. Couldn't have another cake afterwards (and I really like cake). Lovely view over the beach too.","5","2014-04"
"Very impressive","Went here for a high tea one afternoon in Dubai, very impressed. Food was spectacular, and the views from the skybar are amazing. You can see both ends of the city from up there, and the Atlantis Palm. 

Service was great, really couldn't fault it at all. We didn't have a window seat, but it doesn't matter, you can still see the views and get up and take photos anyway. Worth a try for sure. ","5","2014-04"
"Nice stay, hotel room is kind of tacky","My husband and I spent three nights at the BAA on our way home from Africa.  Overall, we had a very lovely time.  I had wanted to stay at this hotel for years, having seen it way back when during the Roger Federer rooftop tennis tournament.  

I'm glad I stayed here, but I likely won't stay again.  At $2,000+ a night, it's no where close to the most luxurious hotel we've stayed in.  On the plus side: the rooms are huge, the staff are incredible, and the grounds are quite nice and well maintained.  The morning breakfast buffet spread is impressive and the food is very good, albeit very, very expensive.  There are designer toiletries, and the evening turndown treats were always fun.  

That being said, the room itself just wasn't my idea of luxury. Yes, the room was huge - 2 floors, a huge spiral staircase, a couch that easily held 8 people.  However, it honestly felt like a preschool had vomited all over the room, what with all the primary colors.  Blue, yellow, red - I understand this is the decor that appeals to people in other regions, but it isn't my style and ended up feeling more tacky than luxurious.  Also, there was a mirror mounted over the bed - that isn't, in my opinion, luxurious.  More like ""Pretty Woman""-ish. 

I'm really glad I stayed here to check it off my travel ""bucket list"", if you will, but I don't need to return.  

I also think the lobby and restaurants give the average person enough of a glimpse into what the hotel is like that staying there isn't really necessary.  I wouldn't discourage someone from staying here if they wanted to, but I would not put this in the upper echelon of hotels/resorts I've been lucky enough to visit.  Definitely very good, but not great - which one expects from a ""seven star"" hotel.","4","2013-10"
"Dubai's Iconic Structure Indeed Provides a world class lodging experience with great service -- wow","We had an extraordinary stay at the Burj al Arab as part of our honeymoon.

First, it is great to experience being in, let alone staying in the iconic structure of this city – Dubai’s statue of liberty, Eiffel Tour, or Big Ben.  The exterior is stunning and the interior cannot be forgotten either.  We loved how the interior colors vary slightly with each floor, creating a beautiful color pallet as one gazes up from the lobby (see our photo).  The room interiors are certainly luxurious.  I cannot deny that they are a bit Las Vegas with lots of gold finishes – also not sure we needed a mirror above our bed but again it’s part of the Burj experience.

The staff were just extraordinary and so kind and attentive.  What makes a world class hotel.  Their special touches for our honeymoon will not be forgotten such as the very extensive flower arrangements in our room after returning from our Culinary Flight (see below).

I would add that the spa is stunning.  The wall mosaic paneling makes it feel like you might run into a Roman Emperor there, or perhaps literally a sheikh.  It is beautifully and tastefully done.  Particularly liked the pool with its panoramic views of the city.

We did the Culinary Flight which was a unique and wonderful experience.  It entails visiting each one of the Burj’s restaurants.  The staff was so attentive and treated us like royalty – thanks especially to food & beverage manager Ivan A. who oversaw a great dining experience and then spent time chatting with us during dessert, providing fascinating details on how the property works.  Please see our review of Culinary Flight.

We were so pleased to have experienced this wonderful top hotel of the world and would recommend it strongly.","5","2014-04"
"Beware of the Service Charges, they bite!!","All of the rates at this hotel are subject to 10% Municipality Fees and 10% Service Charge.  There is also a ""Tourism Dirham Fee"" of 20.00AED per bedroom per night.

Why do I have to pay a service charge fee?  The room rates are already sky high for the service.

Why can you not just include these fees in your quoted prices?  Why don't the quoted prices on your website and in your communications with guests reflect the final costs?","1","2014-04"
"Cannot help returning to this fabulous hotel!","Just returned from yet another visit to the Burj.  Aside from the general splendour of this place, I must comment on the absolute top class service.  The management cannot do enough to please and the general attitude of all the staff from operational managers to butlers and restaurant staff is simply unique; the general idea being that nothing is ever impossible and the quicker it is done, the better! The restaurant on the beach is a new addition and the service there too is superb.  Variety and fresh produce makes it a popular place to go.  The beach is immaculate and no expense is spared in providing each guest with free afternoon snacks, (they call them amenities), which are brought to you directly on the beach.  Plentiful provision of recliners and side tables makes one's experience on the sea front, a most pleasant one.  The heated swimming pool is exceptionally well looked after and there is an unlimited number of support staff who work hard to make your every wish come true.  Super stuff!! 
Do not neglect to visit the souk, the hotel mini transporters will take you there for free and the hotel has made arrangements that all its guests have an opportunity to go on a barge free of charge on a tour of the surrounding area, leading to the souk.  Do not miss this perk as the views are stunning.  
Finally, aim to visit the fish restaurant, which protrudes into the sea, nearby.  The fish they offer there is on another level altogether! Expensive naturally, but the experience is worth it.","5","2014-04"
"Beautiful place, attentive staff, lovely food","My 2 year old son was delighted to see huge aquarium on both sides with schools of fishes, made us feel like heaven. 
Our nice tea with hot and fresh addendums was great. 
My son got his first ""fish (soft toy) named George"" from the hotel. Caring and attentive Ms Marianne made us feel that we visited best place on earth.
Burj Al Arab is must to do in Dubai,","5","2014-03"
"Wonderful but not really worth it, go to...","the hotel is one of the best I have been to! the price is really expensive but not worth one night. There is a lot of things you can do, but we didn't have time to explore the city anddd the hotel. I suggest staying at the jumeirah beach resort outside the burj al Arab, and it is the same company, it's worth the price, and they share the same pools.","5","2013-06"
"Sky Bar for lunch","Went for lunch at the Sky Bar before leaving Dubai . It was a very special experience with exceptional food and service , though not for the thrifty . Unfortunately there had been a sandstorm so our view was clouded but still very special . Tip . If you are staying elsewhere book through your hotel concierge who should print a pass for you to access security .","5","2014-03"
"So so...","We made a reservation to eat and have some drinks at the viewpoint restaurant, and probably due to all the requests, fame, and prestige, I'm afraid to say we were very disappointed..
Although the view is incredible, we can't say the same about the service and attention...
I guess the prices are totally ridiculous due to the view, and the type of experience they try to sell you, but actually the food and drinks are just the same as a regular restaurant..","3","2014-04"
"Truly amazing","Burj al arab is so special, I often entertain my clients here and it is a fantastic place to do business, my family often comes with me and they enjoy the situation of me being in a place where we can do both. It is currently getting very busy for Easter and I will be sorry to check out tomorrow.","5","2014-04"
"Sky Bar","Having never been to the Burj, my good friends recommended it was a must to visit whilst in Dubai. They were right! We went for cocktails on my last night and it was a real treat to experience the splendour and opulence of the hotel. I would recommend that one books a.s.a.p to ensure one is seated at the best tables in the bar especially at nighttime which overlook the city. We were late booking and were seated at the other end overlooking the ocean.  Not much to see in the dark but we were forewarned at the time of booking! 

One last comment on dress code though. At the time of booking we were given a receipt confirming booking. On it the dress code is clearly stated. Cocktail dresses or similar for ladies and smart for men. No tee shirts, jeans, sandals or similar. To my horror, whilst passing through the end of the bar to the rest rooms, there was a gentleman sitting in one of the prime seats, wearing a white tee shirt, no collar and short sleeves. All my three friends saw this as well and we all were disappointed that standards were not being maintained as requested by the management.. I think the dress code should be adhered to at all times.

However, it was a wonderful evening enjoyed by us all. Thank you.

"Flawless! Skyview Bar!","I made reservation, which everyone should do if you're planning to go inside this Amazing place. I made mine online which is easy. I Did the afternoon tea with my siblings.  One word.. Amazing.. we loved it. They feed you pretty well and they serve you well. We had the best sea view. And we couldn't ask for better seating.  It's a must visit.  And the prices is reasonable.. 450 dirham per person.. which is around 120 dollars.  But it's with every penny 👍","5","2014-03"

"Simply Superb","Everything about this hotel is truly WORLD CLASS.
The staff are welcoming and seem genuinely interested in ensuring you have a trouble free stay, absolutely no request is seen as too much to ask.
The food is superb, whether it be in the simple(well it's not really simple) buffet, served in the room,on the beach, in the submarine restaurant or at the Top Of The Hotel in the summit.ALL the food, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner is exquisite.
The suites are out of this world, with fantastic views of The World, The Palm, Jumeirah (depending upon where you are located).
I have stayed here several times in a duplex suite and a 2 bed suite when the family travelled with me...kids love the attention and treats they receive.
Helicopter transfer from and to airport is costly, but what do you expect...everything here has a price and none of it's cheap, however, if you have the money you certainly get (in my opinion) value for money.
Huge baths (and bathrooms) walk in showers, luxury accomodation at the very highest level.","5","2014-03"
"Best of the best","Sky view bar is one of best in the world. Service is impeccable. High tea is highly recommended.
No words for it, is just a magical experience with unbelievable service. Located on 27th floor of hotel with a breathtaking view.
If you are having special occasion, they arrange flower and a goodies bag for take away
WONDERFUL experience 
A little pricey 600 Dirhams per person but worth every Dirham

Rooms are amazing and hotel facilities are top of the line with Golden service","5","2014-04"
"Jewel of Dubai, few areas to improve","Burj Al a Arab a property that can be truly termed as the Jewel of Dubai. What they offer is not an hotel service but an experience which is beyond luxury.

We checked in for a three night stay from the 20th Feb. We booked the one bedroom panaromic suite and insisted on having the same view as advertised. And it was exactly what we got upon check-in to our suite. The view, the room, the ambience all proclaims high levels of luxury and a life time unforgettable experience. Have tried to sum up below the key points based on our experience.

1) Reservation:

Initially we did have hiccups with the response time to our reservation requirements via their reservation email id. Took me one phone call and an escalation mail from my side to get things sorted out. However at the end everything was done as per requirement.

I think the reservation team needs streamline a little bit more to avoid multiple representatives handling the same guest thereby avoid confusion and repetition of information.

However the housekeeping team and the chef's team were proactive and reactive to our email requirements.

2) Arrival at the Airport

After clearing immigration and getting our baggage I had assumed that we would see one representative from the hotel near the exit door after the duty free shop however their was none. We were clueless and after walking for a certain distance we located their booth inside the airport. When they saw us and verified the details they were concerned on we taking so long to check out from the immigration and served us juice and water while we took some time to rest with the small baby.

If they can greet the guest near the duty free it would be really helpful considering that it will be little confusing to locate Burj staff in this huge airport for first timers to Dubai.

3) Airport Transfer

We had requested to book for the Rolls Royce Phantom for pick up and drop for the airport transfer however after checkin we realized that the Phantom was not booked for drop back to airport (another issue with reservations department). Nevertheless the Phantom experience was amazing, the chauffeur was very charming and well trained.

However pls not when the hotel commits that we will play your favorite songs in the car during the airport transfer, we realized that it doesn't mean that. It actually means we have to pick up a song we like from their prefixed song menu and ask them to play that.

Upon meeting the Chauffeur, a delightful bouquet was given to me which was beautifully arranged.

Since we had informed that we had a baby with us a baby seat was arranged in the Phantom however the same was not provided during our return back to airport when we availed their complimentary Mercedes airport drop service based on the package that we had taken. This was a bit strange and was wondering is safety is tagged to a price.

The car is very well maintained and very grand. It was bliss seating inside that and cursing the roads of Dubai on our way to the hotel.

4) Check-in to the Suite

Upon arrival to the hotel in the afternoon, we were greeted with wet towels and dates and was taken to our room by a hotel staff.

Check-in was done in the room with one small hiccup:

Our security deposit had to be made either with credit card or cash upon checkin and not through debit card, which was not informed to us by the reservations team.

5) Un-packing of luggage:

Un-packing of service when requested took them a long time to respond to the action.

6) Butler's

It would have been easier for the guest if one dedicated butler could be assigned to the guest per room during the stay and maybe another one for night shift. We had different butlers being send every time thereby making it uncomfortable to be dealing with different person every day.

Also we felt customer profiling is sometimes being done by the Butlers where the butler who was assigned to during our day of checkin didn't greet us on visit our room the next day but when on with her work. Some of the other butlers were very courteous.

The floor receptionists was also very helpful however we felt he was not well informed on the guest billing details thereby during checkout asking us to pay for a service which was already part of the pack, following which he once again verified the same and agreed to out understanding.

7) Housekeeping and Dining services both In-room and the restaurants

Both these teams can be termed as the star performers of the hotel. Their hard work towards guest satisfaction clearly shows in their quality of performance.

Keeping the room Spick and span, catering to all our needs, sterilizing baby bottles, turn down service even for the kids, and all done with a smile.

In-room dinning staff are also well trained and perform their activities with thorough professionalism.

I had informed them exact timing and details for serving the infant food and the same was done with high precision.

One loophole: For the world's luxurious hotel, they would need to invest some money on new cutleries as we had to return our cutleries provided to us as part of in-room service as they were fully worn out.

8) Room

The panaromic suite was very spacious with the ground floor easily accommodating an additional bed and the first floor having the bedroom and the baby cot.

Beach slippers, towels and toiletries were all kept in the room.

Hermes toiletries as well as lots of towels.

Few points to note:

a) Their is a huge mirror right on top of the bed which becomes very uncomfortable to see once people are lying down. It seemed like a very weird idea to put a mirror on the ceiling above the bed.

b) Not sure on the gold IPad, since our room had a tablet of an unheard brand, as heavy as a brick to operate the room controls. However since the butlers decided to Knock on the doors rather then ring the bell we couldn't use the controls to open the door and had to do it manually every time, since the door open button works only if the person rings the bell.

c) fruit platter preferences were adhered to which was really helpful since my baby is allergic to certain fruits and keeping whole fruits such as pineapple is very dangerous with kids around. Hence we had that removed. Thereafter every day the fruit platter was made based on our initial requirements.

d) complimentary baklawa and dates kept in the room was very fresh and soft.

e) all infant requirements were taken care of in a professional manner.

f) The bed was as soft as feather.

9) Baby's and Kids

Children will freak out with the chocolate cart that arrives at your doorstep in the evening not every day though and they are permitted to freak out on taking as many varieties of chocolates and popcorn as they like. It is at no additional charge.

Baby- the baby cot was so cosy and well done with teddy bear and a lullaby musical equipment stuck to the top and wonderful and soft mattress and quilt.

Infant menu is also available upon request and contains a healthy mix.

For breakfast in the restaurants their are baby chairs as well as babies are given tiny little aprons so that they don't spill on their dress.

Turn down service sometimes contained special things for the baby as well.

Infant toiletries were also kept in the room along with baby bottle sterilizer and also a new feeding bottle.

The lifts are huge with enough provision for strollers and to go to the ground floor from the fountain area with a stroller their is a lift provision. 

Kids along with their parents can also pre schedule a visit to the turtle rehabilitation center, located in their other property.

10) Other notes

a) Their are shops in the ground floor as well as an ATM machine. The shops also stocks provision items such as diapers, swim wears, souvenirs etc. 

b) It is very difficult to get buggies some times from the hotel to the beach area specially in the morning.

c) Kids are not allowed in the Skyview bar and also in few of the restaurants for lunch and dinner such as the aquarium restaurant (not sure of the name) of the hotel.
 
Overall we can say yes this was a wonderful family holiday, however we felt that the opulence of the place supersedes the hospitality and the warmthness of the place.!

"Fantastic Afternoon Tea in the Sahn Eddar Restaurant, Peter L, Hungary","Unbelievable visit. We had Afternoon Tea. I booked for 2 and went 3. At the entry to the restaurant I just casually mentioned that we were 3. The receptionist didn't missed a beat, just disappeared, maybe for 40 seconds, then came back and escorted us the table. First a lady waiter came to us, introduced herself and told she would take care of us. The Tea's first 'course"" was a glass of champagne. The service was outstanding, the meal taste is wonderful and the china is tailor/designer made. Although the meals were small portions, at the end the 7 courses added up. During and after the Tea we walked around the floor, visited shops and had a look around. I specificly selected the Sahn Eddar restaurant because assumed that from here I would be able to see the structure of the building and could take some photos. It turned out I was right. I took a lot of pictures, at the beginning I was anxious but later it seemed nobody was bothered. We drank 1 glass extra champagne, they charged for that 46$ but I say it was worth to take it considering the whole experience.","5","2014-03"
"Sky View Afternoon Tea - Perfect!","A truly unforgettable experience. The Hotel is amazing and our Afternoon Tea was wonderful. Starting with champagne and then lots of little courses all served by our attentive waiter on beautiful china, overlooking The Palm. I am Coeliac and my gluten free option was perfect and my Husband's was fantastic as well.  It is expensive but absolutely worth every penny. True perfection! ","5","2014-04"
"Awesome!","Booked the burj al Arab for afternoon tea, food and service outstanding and a great experience. Staff were very attentive and the view from the sky view restaurant were amazing. Would recommend it to anyone going to Dubai.","5","2014-03"
"Dream Vacation!","Simply awesome hotel. Personalization starts right at the airport itself. I had booked a Rolls Royce for pickup and was received very well. The welcome at the Lobby was also great with the staff greeting you with local fanfare. I had leased a Lamborghini and it was standing right next to the lobby, felt like a star each time I took it for a drive with all the photos taken :). everything was well arranged for and seamless. The Room on 21st floor was simply breathtaking, goldplating everywhere including restrooms!!. I had brought my 2 kids along and everything from baby monitors to car seats where provided. The floor Butler was very accomodative to all our requests including a late check out. Each restaurant at the Burj Al Arab was distinct , we tried everything from the Sahneddar to the skyview bar. The best part is no matter how high you set your expectations on this hotel, the experience will beat it! Will surely visit again.","5","2014-04"
"Special treat for 25th Anniversary","My husband and I spent a few days in Dubai in March celebrating our silver wedding and decided to have afternoon tea in the Skybar. What a fantastic experience. The hotel is amazing and has the WOW factor from viewing it from the beach to stepping inside, no expense or detail has been spared. 
Our afternoon tea was booked for 4.30pm on the 20th March, we arrived at 4pm and spent 20 minutes admiring the interior befor being whisked up to the Skybar via the external lift by very helpful staff. 
The interior of the skybar is reminiscent to me of a 1950's ocean liner with a lot of white and strong shades of blue and green, it is very striking. We were shown to our table which was sadly, not actually in the window but we still had a good view and there was never a problem if anyone wanted to get up and wander around to admire the fantastic views and take photos of the palm or downtown Dubai, we were lucky as the day was clear so the views were amazing.
We spent 2 hours eating afternoon tea....which was an amazing and very special experience. A glass of champagne and stuffed dates to start,  followed by shortbread with fresh berries, slice of roast beef with pomme puree and mustard sauce (which was an unusual course but very tasty), a selection of sandwiches in a variety of different breads, a large selection of fancy cakes, scones and a dessert (camel milk brulee), finally a sorbet to cleanse the pallette, all washed down with as many different teas as we cared to try. We were also presented with a red rose and a lovely chocolate mousse gateau to celebrate our anniversary by our very atttentive waiter and given a small box of chocolates as we left. The price may seem expensive at first sight but the whole experience took us three hours and the quality of food and attention was definately 7 Star so if you go to Dubai this is one thing you should do if at all possible.","5","2014-03"
"Bur Al Arab","This place will knock your socks off!!  Our two story suite was decorated like a 15 Million dollar penthouse with 7 star service to match.  The amenities are fabulous and the architecture is stunning throughout the hotel is amazing.  The food is great but expensive.  The wine list is not for the feint of heart as the prices average about 8 times more expensive that similar wines in the US.","5","2014-04"
"Wow!!! Probably only ever go there once so enjoy and font look at prices ;-)","Wow!_ I always wanted ti go here And so treated myself last week...nb!!_ you must book or you won't pass security gate....I booked for cocktails in the skyview bar for my aunt and myself...we were given our time and told very politely there was a minimum spend which worked out approx £42 each .....from the moment we arrived and greeted by doormen I felt like royalty....we took lift up to the skyview bar after being memorised by the amazing fish aquarium in the reception.   We were shown to our window table and quickly given gorgeous canapes...we chose our cocktails and decided not to look at prices it was like monopoly money!  But I probably will never be back ..... 2 cocktails later and a scrummy prawn snack it worked out for me approx £80 but I have no regrets....the music...atmosphere.. Attentiveness of staff...view was worth it....if I win the lottery I'd live to go for afternoon tea and see the view in daylight","5","2014-03"
"Culinary Flight Dining - The Best of the Best!","What can you say when you are presented with the best meal in the best hotel?  My boyfriend and I went to Dubai for my 50th birthday, and I knew I wanted to celebrate with a special dinner.  This was an excuse to go over-the-top.  I did want to eat at the Burj, but I could not decide which restaurant to choose from.  When I discovered the Culinary Flight, a truly magnificent dining experience, I knew this was it.  Since each of the 7 courses are served in a different restaurant of the hotel, you basically get to try all of them (and dining here is the only way to see the hotel if you are not a guest). While the menu is limited, the portions are full sized - not tastings.  Go hungry - and allow at least 3 hours.  We would have liked to start earlier to see the sunset from the Skyview Bar, where you have your first course (the pre-dinner cocktail), but you cannot arrive before 7 pm, as they serve high tea in the late afternoon.  The food was divine; I was able to have a piece of steak in the seafood restaurant, and I must say it was the best beef I ever tasted.  As much as we did not want to fill up on bread, you just can't help it, as each course has a different variety.  Ordering is done in advance, so the wait is not too long.  Each restaurant was stunning, and the service was impeccable, as they escort you from place to place and address you by name.  It makes it very personal.   They even went over and above on two counts... we received a complimentary lamb dish, courtesy of the chef of Il Iwan, the Arabian restaurant, as well as an additional dessert to commemorate my birthday.  Beware, it is not cheap... but then again, if you can justify the expense for a special occasion, then I highly recommend the Culinary Flight.  This is not your ordinary meal... it is a truly wondrous dining experience to be savored!","5","2014-03"
"Afternoon Tea at the Burj Al Arab","My partner and I were recently in Dubai to celebrate both our bithdays (18th and 23rd March) and went to the Burj Al Arab for afternoon tea in the Sky View bar. I knew the view would be quite good but......it was absolutely spectacular! We were really quite lucky to get a clear day with little to no haze and the views over the Palm at one end of the bar and Downtown at the other were something that has just got to be experienced!
The service was impeccable and the content of the afternoon tea was also perfect. 
From the champagne welcome through all the courses of sandwiches, pastries, dainties and scones, everything was done in a way that made you feel as if you were someone really special, especially when my partner was presented with a birthday cake and a single red rose, she was absolutely thrilled.
For anyone visiting Dubai, I would say that this has got to be on your list of things to do, it is absolutely perfect, it was certainly an experience we shall never forget, and so glad we did it.","5","2014-03"
"unlike anything else","I can't think of a single thing that can be improved upon. The service was impeccable. The suites are impressive and perfectly outfitted with simply the best of everything. The staff remembers you and your preferences of the smallest detail are noted and integrated. The property is its own enclave of luxury that you may never feel the need to leave, but alas business is business and most people will either need to or want to explore the surrounding areas. Our clients were attending a three day event off site and the events concierge manager handled every detail expertly, specifically
some rather intricate transportation and security needs that were seamlessly executed. In short this property is a global gold standard, as one would expect.","5","2013-11"
"Afternoon tea is amazing!","If you are visiting Dubai go and have afternoon tea at the Burj al Arab and you will not be disappointed! The staff are welcoming and so efficient, nothing is too much trouble and the food is delicious and plentiful. It was great to just get to see this beautiful hotel, and the views from the lounge used for tea are stunning.
We are planning a return visit next year!","5","2014-02"
"Superb attention to detail","This Hotel continues to wow me, it over delivers at a magnitude which has to be experienced to be believed... It's not cheap, but its one of life's experiences which you just must try if you can !
From the minute you cross the bridge to the Hotel you feel special like an individual VIP, just before you meet the wide smiling polite who greet you like the special guest you are. No one here   can ever do enough to help. From the exquisite Hermes bathroom amenities, to a nice bottle of red wine, fresh fruit & flowers and your choice of newspaper every day, the gift each night on your pillow, free Wi Fi throughout the surprises just keep coming. Even your beach bag is collectible !  Talking of beaches The Burj has it's own exclusive one which you get to by buggy, at your convenience of course. No problem is ever a problem for long, especially when Mr Ahmed Ereiba  
is there to help. He has such a caring attitude and is such an asset to The Burj.    
This hotel is without doubt the Worlds Most Luxurious Hotel.. try it and see  .....    
You'll leave with a big smile guaranteed !

"wonderful property but delays on arrival","My husband and I are not in our first flush of youth and arrived in Dubai on a Silversea cruise.  We had arranged to be collected from the ship by the Hotel.  The ship arrived on-time at 8am and we disembarked at the time we agreed to be picked up.   There was no-one there to meet us.  We did find a representative of the Hotel but he was picking up another guest.  He was very reluctant to help us but eventually 'our car' came about an hour after it should have arrived.  The car was nice and we were offered a choice of music for the journey and cool towels and water in the car but at our age we cannot really stand for an hour in the hot sun.  When we arrived at The Burj we were welcomed and offered dates and delicious tea but then had another long wait for our suite to be available.  Our daughter had booked the hotel as a treat for us and I know she had paid for the previous night so that the room was available for our arrival.  When the room was eventually ready 4 hours later we had been upgraded to a lovely suite with a snooker room in it.  A waste for us but the suite was superb.  The suite was stocked with free amenities and we were given a bottle of champagne for the problems on check-in but we were so tired by the day of waiting around that it really spoilt our 3 night stay.  I know that our daughter told the hotel that we were not young so it is a shame that they did not make sure that our room was ready.","3","2014-01"
"awesome ambience","thats a great place to visit once in life with beautiful architecture .:) where i was welcomed and with a best service and care aboutthe belongings... i dont remember name but the person gave me tour was very kind humanbeing ..","5","2013-11"
"Food and View","Although I did not stay there myself for over night in the hotel I had booked for lunch and tour around the hotel. I certainly enjoyed my lunch as well as fantastic view from Al muntaha Restaurant 27th floor.","5","2013-04"
"Very good, but wow - so expensive!","Burj Al Arab is really all about superlatives! The hotel is over the top in every single way! Incredibly large rooms (bigger than most apartments I've ever lived in), very generous toiletries and amenities, etc., nice pool, beach and spa. My one criticism is that in the restaurants, especially the signature ones, they do up-sell very aggressively. Detracts from the experience.","4","2014-02"
"The most amazing hotel!","Although I did not stay there myself (far too pricey for a business trip!) I was lucky enough to be able to do a tour of the hotel. It is simple awesome in the truest sense of the word! Not only are the views breathtaking but the interior of the hotel is truly amazing. Amazing suites and restaurants with a view that cannot be beaten! Staff are very professional, friendly and always on hand to assist.This is the place to stay for that special anniversary, when only 7 stars is good enough!","5","2014-03"
"bad manner butler","one day stay here, surprised by the building, dreamt to come. really beautiful hotel, nice dec. but mood was destroyed by a butler call Damon,this guy don't know how to serve guest, the attitude, do I looked poor?!  if you don't know how to smile don't work!! very bad manner. the way he look at you you can sense the angry and ignore from him. I spend money here not to bear you. I should have complained about this when check out, but to catch flight I prefer write here. 
don't recommend this. the staff is showing their noble and pride, you call yourself 7 star???","1","2014-03"
"Experiance the beauty","It was the trip of a lifetime...
Everything was high class. The athmosphere inside is magical. I couldn't find a single dust spot in the entire suite. The luxury is everywhere and the staff is friendly all the time. I had the best sleep in that Dux matress. You can't go to Dubai without seeing Burj Al Arab.","5","2013-04"
"Atemberaubend - breathtaking!","We had this culinary flight and the location, service and the offerer food and beverages were all really high class. We enjoyed a very courteous staff at this unique place and a breathtaking view over Dubai. Very extraordinary, very impressing, remarkable and recommendable!!!","5","2014-03"
"Such a tall hotel","My worlds best hotel is the Burj Al Arab. It's in Dubai, the worlds riches city in the world. At night, fountains fall everywhere. The light is fire. It's decorate of nature and high-technolagy. I've heard that hotel is at the beginning of the ocean. So that hotel is the best hotel in the world. It has good service. Good view. The end.","5","2014-02"
"One of the best","We stayed with our two kids at the Burj in one of the two bedroom suites from March 4th to the 6th and it was amazing.  It is one of the most beautiful hotels with the service to match.  Everything was perfect, we enjoyed the surroundings and the food.  On our next visit we hope to  again spend a couple of days to enjoy the amenities and the service.","5","2014-03"
"Heaven in Dubia","Stunning, beautiful, exquiste these are only a few of the words to describe this hotel. It is amazing everything that you could ever want or need. I enjoyed every minute of my stay hear including the staff singing happy birthday to me on my 21st Birthday. My only criticism is that the pool area is letting the place down its so small and when the sun is on the opposite side of the building you get no sunlight. The beach is the other option and this was superb.","5","2013-05"
"Unique","Very unique service is amazing must see if you're in Dubai the lobby is huge and fountains are just wonderful   View from room is great and very close to emirates mall amenities are first class the security is very tight but you don't really notice , good job !!!!","4","2014-03"
"Late morning Skyview Bar Tea","Having tried to book for afternoon tea during our first visit to Dubai some three weeks before only to find it was fully booked during the time of our visit we were offered a new service which was effectively the same as the afternoon tea but started at 11am until 12.30pm, the bonus being it was slightly cheaper and definitely more relaxed and less hurried as there were only 20 of us in the restaurant.

The whole experience was worth every penny, the view, the ride up to the restaurant on the panoramic lift, the staff and their excellent unobtrusive service and finally the sandwiches, cakes, scones and sweets which were delicious. There was so much of it that we couldn't eat it all so the staff packed what was left in a box and we took it with us together with a box of 4 delicious Belgian chocolates.

We have had afternoon tea in many cities around the world but this left the rest standing and was a wonderful memory which someday we hope we can repeat.","5","2014-03"
"Simply different","Now whenever I would want to feel like a queen I would definitely go to Burj Al Arab.. No other words can describe it other than magnificent. It is beauty in the water. From the time you enter please keep your cameras handy on stand by, you don't want to miss any photo memories afterwards. The lobby is breath taking it has two huge aquariums on the side with beautiful waterfall which looks like fish jumping here and there. The staff is friendly from the valet till your room. The upper lobby is as colorful as the entire hotel. The lifts are all golden which signifies the color of the country as it is actually land of gold. The rooms are huge with a butler service. Choose any side of the hotel you will have a breath taking view. The rooms are fit a king and the bathrooms definitely fit for the queens with Jacuzzi and bath salts. Living room is my priority with 8 seated dining table and soft sofa with a view of Dubai's palm Jumeirha and The World.","4","2014-02"
"A treat, an experience!","A must do if you're visiting Dubai for the first time. Well worth the amazing experience. 
The service is excellent and the surroundings are beautiful. Located on the sea, perfect sights of the Jumeirah hotel and luxurious cars, you definitely feel special. The food is delicious and filling and the staff are welcoming as soon as you arrive. Went for my mums 60th birthday and they also organized a small cake to take home.

"Feast for the eyes","This is just incredible - it is the most incredible structure with true Arab design and decor!  A feast for the eyes but the restaurant was certainly not a feast for the stomach- the service was good, the food very average and the wine excellent.  It was certainly worth a visit to see the view and experience the hotel in its glory, however, one should not waste one's $$ on the restaurant when Dubai has so many other fabulous restaurants.","4","2013-04"
"Sky View Bar high tea do not miss it","First we had our doubt because its not a cheap experience. But its worth every euro we spent. If you come in time you can sit near the window and overlook the city of Dubai and the Burj Khalifa.
The staff is excellent and a pleasure to talk with. The food was what you can expect of a hotel like this. Also a chance to look in a hotel ike this and use the glass lift. I would say go!","5","2014-03"
"Worth a visit","We went to BURJ AL ARAB hotel for afternoon tea.. It is the ONLY 7 star hotel in the world. It is absolutely fabulous. The interior is beautiful, the restaurant is on the 27 th floor. On entering they ask if it's a special occasion, birthday/ anniversary ect. It was our wedding anniversary , which our son treated us to.   A glass of champagne is poured for you. Then starters is a date with orange . Then a fresh berry tart , a good slice of meat & a swirl of creamed potatoes, then sandwiches & a variety of cakes & scones. Tea or coffee. The service is excellent. Since it was our anniversary I got a small cake with HAPPY anniversary & a fresh red rose. The view from the 27 th floor is amazing. You can request a take home box with any cakes or scones which are left.","5","2014-03"
"dream come true: afternoon tea at BAA","thanks to an autralian blogger who lives in Dubai; ic hose this venue overe the sky experience at floor 27, cause I did not wanted to be in a tourist crowd. Junsui turned out to be the experience at BAA that we were looking for. Great view, great food, great service and fair price..what else? oh yes! we were in the Burj Al Arab...dream come true","5","2014-02"
"Once in a lifetime experience","I stayed here as it was on my bucket list to & it was the best hotel experience ive ever had! I got picked up from the airport in a white s class mercedes & greeted with flowers. On the way to the hotel the driver couldnt have been more polite & offered me bottled water & asking if the car temperature was ok. I arrived at the hotel to be greeted by my butler for my stay. I was shown to my suite & shown how everything worked. They took me fresh fruit & juice without me asking! The bed was so comfy & the suite was out of this world. Gold plated tv, staircase, toilet fittings the lot! The room was spotlessly clean also. I wasnt sure how to work the bathtub & couldnt get the plug to work so my butler came & didnt just show me, but ran my bath! I was treated like royalty. The breakfast was lovely & fresh & again, staff couldnt do enough. I got a manicure in the spa which I felt was highly overpriced for what it was but enjoyed a pamper. Used the pools which were so relaxing. Thank you Burj al Arab for making my stay so memorable & im saving for my next stay already!","5","2014-01"
"Dream come true","Burj al arab is one the most luxorious hotels  i have ever stayed in, from the rooms to the food and the view- completely breathtaking! It made my trip to dubai even more beautiful and memorable! I would tottaly suggest every1 dis amazing hotel","5","2014-02"

"ONCE IN A LIFE TIME EXPERIENCE","If you get the chance and would like to experience a once in a life time opportunity then the Burj Al Arab is the hotel for you.  This was the most memorable stay I have ever experienced.  The service was second to none, the food was amazing and the overall hotel was out of this world.
I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Absolutely fantastic!!","5","2014-03"
"Great, improvements required","The Location is great, the architecture is great, the aquarium in the lobby is a great welcome, the reception that takes place in the lounge and not at a desk is individual and professional, the elevator down to the restaurant at the aquarium is a unique surprise, to watch the fish during dinner is sensational, the quality of the food is superb.
The two-level architecture of the suites is great.
The remote control is funny and could be a challenge for non-technical People.
Improvements recommended:  The interior design of the suites is a bit overdone and not of excellent taste, not a perfect style, however very convenient.  The buttler service at the beginning is a bit too much, he shows up every 5 minutes to offer something, the big TV set in the bedroom is oldfashioned not state of the art, the check out service on the same floor is routine and professional but not heartful. The shuttle service to the airport by a Rolls Royce is to expensive and the driver does not even carry the luggage across the street, for § 250 you get the Feeling being delivered by a Yellow Cab in NY
Overall it is a nice experience which is pretty unique.
Is it worthwile the high Price??? For 2-3 das, YES.
Major complaint:  You cannot hook up you personal Notebook to the Internet, you only can use the Notebook provided by the Hotel.","5","2013-06"
"A truly outstanding hotel","A stay at the Burj Al Arab is a must, the service is excellent, and the food outstanding.

The building is breathtaking standing out against the sea and sky, the foyer breathtaking, rising 27th floors up into the heart of the building - a truly outstanding hotel.","5","2014-03"
"absolutely fabulous","I celebrated my 55th year birthday in Dubai and capped it with High Tea at the Burj Al Arab.  The experience was tremendous,  The staff were excellent and helpful, the food was enjoyable and continued to be replenished if I required.  The view from my window seat was outstanding.  I was alone but didnt feel alone.  The staff catered to my every need and to finish presented me with a lovely single rose and a lighted candle on a small cake.  Such a lovely gesture.  I would recommend this experience and the hotel to everyone.  A must have experience.  Thanks again to everyone who made my high tea special.","5","2014-02"
"Over the top","It is over the top in all areas but so what ,you will probably only do it once.

The rooms were outrageous but great ,the restaurants and the afternoon tea were over priced but great.The whole place is so completely outrageous we enjoyed every minute of it ;

YOU REALLY DO ONLY LIVE ONCE.","4","2014-03"
"Skyview Bar at Burj al Arab","Very nice bar with right ambience and atmosphere. Perfect service from entering the Burj al Arab until personal waiter at the table. Live jazz music adding fine mood. Food and drinks were delicious. Definitely worth visiting anytime.","5","2014-02"
"Believe the hype...","Brilliant bar, beautiful setting, once in a lifetime. Just do it. Dont analyse it or over think it. It's worth the sensorial experience. Sit back, select your poison and enjoy. Book in advance and arrive at least 20 minutes before reservation.","5","2014-02"
"Overpriced, overrated hotel","It's a nice hotel, but 7 stars, really?
The décor of the hotel it's lame and everything it's overpriced. The food was excellent though...Anyway, I had higher expectations from this hotel. There are so many beautiful hotels in Dubai, it's really not worth staying at this one.","2","2013-12"
"Gorgeous hotel","My husband and I enjoyed our visit to this hotel. It was the highlight of our stay in Dubai on the way back from the Maldives. The rooms were huge and gorgeous but the colors a little over the top which was what we were expecting. The service within the hotel was great but the guards outside the tower were a little obnoxious when you came into the hotel. I understand having to check the guests names but even when they knew we were guests, they still had an attitude. After showing them our passports, one guard took it and flipped it around then asked us if our passports were ""diplomatic"" (which they clearly were not.. and what difference would that really make?).  We sometimes felt like there was a bit of attitude from some of the employees and having stayed at a lot of luxurious resorts and hotels around the world, we were quite surprised. With that said, service once within the hotel was great. The butlers were always around to help, they even organized a whole cake and rose bouquet surprise for us. The doormen were also helpful assuring the taxis that we got into would not rip us off (we did get scammed by one in the city). If visiting Dubai again, we would definitely stay again as it truly was part of our experience in Dubai.","4","2014-02"
"Decadent","The first view of this hotel is breathtaking standing out and stretching into the sky, this Hugh building is stunning.  Walking up the main drive and passing the rolls Royce's as they drove up and down the drive was exciting.  Inside the foyer is amazing and looking upwards the roof stretches up to the 27th floor , up a long escalator which moves along side the large aquarium is interesting.  A large water fountain display at the top here before getting the lift up to the 27 th floor where we had a very sumptuous lunch in a restaurant with full length windows affording great views over the beaches and Dubai.  The service was second to none , the crockery Furnishings and decor was great too. The food also was superb with a great choice of dishes. I would highly recommend this hotel for lunch and a few hours of escapism.","5","2014-03"
"Wow","7 starts for a reason , the service is exceptional , very fussy when booking in which is understandable but a bit annoying . Shares beach with Jumeriah and reached by buggy as is exec pool although small pool on site .","5",
"AMAZING","The Burj Al Arab is a must see if you visit Dubai, this is a mind blowing place, you cannot get onto the property without a reservation. We had a private dinner with 15 of our staff memebers it was a black tie event, as we experienced all over Dubai the service was great , the food outstanding amazing views from the 27 floor where we had our private dinner. It must be said that this hotel is VERY expensive so be prepared for that should if you make any kind of booking here for dinner or anything else, but you are guaranteed an experience of a life time.","5","2014-03"
"SUPERB","I stayed here for one night, it was absolute luxury almost beyond words. I could not fault the staff or hotel in any way. Food is the best, but be prepared to pay a lot of money for this kind of service.","5","2013-11"
"Great Atmosphere","We decided to pop in to Al Muntaha Bar And Lounge for a Drink.
Drinks were priced perfectly, we did not order food as we had dinner at a different venue. Make sure you get a side window view to enjoy the evening. Smoking is not allowed and for some reason most of the crowd was elderly to us we are in our 30s","4","2014-02"
"Astonishing!","I have traveled extensively and when I had the recent opportunity to visit the Burj Al Arab I couldn't pass it up. Although there are no official designations for ""7 Star"" Hotel - this one would take the honors! The beauty of the tower amidst the water is tranquil and a beautiful sight. Upon entering the lobby the hotel embodies everything Dubai wants to be: bigger, better, extravagant. 

From the main lobby with the beautiful water fountains and fish tanks on the side walls to the exquisite shops on the second level, this hotel is certainly one of the over-the-top destinations I have been to. It is well done, not overly gaudy - the finishings were well thought out and it showed.

Upstairs to the duplex 2-bedroom unit - each floor had a desk at the elevator station and concierge. There was no lacking for staff, which if I heard right has over 6 employees to every guest. That is incredible! The room was bright and elegantly furnished. Spacious was the word we were looking for. The room had all amenities and was breathtaking. I will say however that I did find the mirror over the bed in the master was reminiscent of Vegas or the old Pocono love shacks and it could've done without that for sure. Maybe it's up there so you can look up at yourself in this opulence and see that, yes, it is really you!

If you are looking for the ultimate hotel experience, you need to stay here for at least a night or two, or until the budget breaks. It is THE experience of Dubai and one that you need to have. I understand that the hotel also gives tours (book ahead) and if you cannot stay here, you should at least visit. It truly will blow you away. And like many of the Dubai properties I visited I found that most are elegant and tastefully done. By the way, one of my favorite things I heard constantly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi was that if you see gold on a ceiling - it actually IS gold - not paint like at home!

Burj Al Arab - a must see!","5","2014-02"
"Poor from a self proclaimed 7 star","Reserved a table in the sky bar on the 23 of February. As we both work in hotels we were really looking forward to this experience. Unfortunately the first contact with the hotel wasn't the greatest one. We contacted the hotel by email to book the table for some drinks. We got a reply back with and the wrong date and a different time what we requested for. We emailed back to change the reservation, the email we got back had the right date but still not the right timing. Later we found out by ourselves that the bar only opens at 7pm, that is why they changed the time automatically instead of explaining the other options for the timing we requested. 
We arrived at the hotel by cab. Everything looked amazing, as you would expect. 
We found our way towards the bar where we ended up in the waiting area which was quite full with other guests, not much seating places for a waiting area and not very welcoming. After 5-10 minutes waiting we were showed our table by the window with the view of the city. If you expect a view of the palm you should book a table for dinner as far we understood. The complimentary nuts and canapés were great, the same as the waiting staff which were attentive and knowledgable about the drinks on the menu. Any special request was served without any hesitation. We ordered the sweet tapas which we were not really impressed with, might be our taste. Unfortunately we had to leave before we had finished our minimum expenses (265 AED per person) The waiter informed us kindly about the above. We were charged the minimum amount. Which we understand. Our most disappointing moment was when we were leaving. We were waiting outside the main entrance and expected a taxi. The bell boys asked us if we were staying in the hotel or we were outside guests. We informed than that we did not stay in the hotel and that was it. No further help for any kind of transport. Even when a taxi came to drop of guest, they did not stop the cab for us . After 10 minutes waiting and with nobody who looked interested in getting us a taxi , we asked the bell boys if there is any other options. He informed us that we should walk over the 0.5 km bridge to the main land to find a cab over there. Not a service what you expect from a '7' start hotel. It felt only if you stay in the hotel or come with a Ferrari they will look after you. We stayed at the ITC Maratha in Mumbai where we we're overwhelmed with the service. A bit disappointing as you spend quite some money for a unique experiences.  ","2","2014-02"
"nice experiance in burj alarab","the location, services is amazing, one of the best place to stay in 
although i stayed one night however i wish if i make it for 2 days to enjoy more. 
every this is perfect, expect little smell in the room however it has been solved by supplong the air refreshing machine ..

the price is quite expensive","4","2014-02"
"Wow","Visited here with my family.  From the Bugatti Veyron in the car park to the amazing decor this place is a must visit destination.  We took dinner in the Al Mahara one evening and then the Al Muntaha.  If you would like to experience the best service, with the best food in the best surroundings then this is the place to do it.  The entrance to the Al Mahara was via a lift pretending to be a submarine.  I was nearly convinced until I saw the same turtle swim past more than once!!!  The food in both restaurant is outstanding and the wine simply perfect.  I can not wait to return this year.","5","2013-08"
"Afternoon tea","We recently had afternoon in the Skyview Lounge, I was SO looking forward to it and may have built my expectations too high. With our exchange rate, it worked out at £83 per person, I did not expect it to be value for money but I expected to feel that it was worth it for the experience - and I was disappointed.

The hotel is lovely but it did not have a 'wow' factor for me, the staff were very courteous and we got a nice table by the window - absolutely beautiful view, very nice glass of champagne, excellent choice of teas. First food was a small piece of shortbread with stawberry and raspberry on top - the shortbread was not light and crisp so not a good start. Next course was beautiful, a very tender slice of roast beef garnished with mashed potatoes and a drizzle of bread sauce. The selection of sandwiches were nice and we were offered (and accepted) more. Then scones and pastries - and this is where I particularly feel that the hype didn't match the actual experience. We were staying in the Shangri La Hotel where the pastries are superb, they look wonderful and taste delicious - our afternoon tea pastries at the Burj looked nice but not fabulous. the scones were more like buns, not light and buttery. I know it is easy to be critical but I just feel for the cost, the standard of food did not match up. I have had afternoon tea in several very nice places and my favourite to date is Gleneagles, Scotland where the standard of food was extremely high.

I am pleased I have been fortunate enough to have had the experience  but I would not  recommend it as a 'must do' when in Dubai. I rated it 'average' which is not really fair, if there had been a 'good' choice, I would have used that.","3","2014-02"
"Completely Ridiculous","I can't believe this place even exist. We were there for 6 nights and not once did I open the door to our room, press the button in the elevator and so on. As guest you get to go to Wild Wadi Water park and every time we went I had to be forceful that I can walk the 2 blocks (give or take)
and I didn't need a ride, the same thing with going to the beach. On the night we arrived we had room service, as with everything here it was EXTREMELY expensive but my wife now list the room service ""The best restaurant in the world"" do to the Cesar Salad. Everyday you will get new shampoo, razor and shaving cream, toothbrush & paste, body wash, ect. The service is just amazing. The buffet breakfast is the same, there are 3 restaurants you can choose, all with great food and service. The view was of the world islands. Now I ask my wife were should we go on vacation? The Burj is the only answer I get. The only thing is we asked for help renting a car and when the guy picked it up I was informed that if I did it myself it would have cost half, the bad thing that goes with staying at a hotel like this.","5","2013-11"
"Holiday","Another excellent stay at this fabulous hotel. The staff were very helpful and attentive can not fault the service. The rooms have fantastic views out to sea and the palm. We look forward to our next stay.","5",
"Simply breath taking, worth the stay","First time I stayed and it was absolutely stunning. Just got off from my trip and I remembered my stay in Dubai's best hotel. Food, service and staff are the best keep it up. Highly recommended for your trip!","5",
"Spectacular view","This hotel is lived up everything that we heard. Service and facilities will definitely meet your expectations. They will consider your diet, mood and security. During my stay the main pool was under maintenance.
Stay at burj al Arab for your honeymoon, you will know why once you enter your bedroom.","5","2013-09"
"Wonderfull and amazing","over alll excellent hotel and would like to visit again soon. every single thing and services are fantastic. definatly would suggest if anyone want they should atleast go once and try their hospitality.its amazing from staff to food..","5","2014-02"
"Ultimate Luxury..!!","The architecture is beautiful, the interior of the hotel is amazing, huge and impressive and the decor looks amazing in red and gold. It has superbly ate: impeccable, courteous and pleasant. Large aquariums entry are interesting and very successful cascade. And what a splendid view of the city and the Sea.","5","2013-07"
"Surpassed all our expectations","Once you have stayed here you will be spoilt for life. From the minute you step through the door you are treated like royalty. Melanie welcomed us with a juice and hot towel and then whisked us straight up to our suite.
The suite is two-storied and larger than the average modern home. A large living area, dining area, office and bathroom occupy the downstairs. You then ascend the sweeping staircase to your enormous bedroom and ultra-luxurious bathroom with Hermes toiletries. On both levels you are entertained to the most magnificent views from the floor to ceiling windows. The curtains are electrically operated but we never wanted to hide the view.
We were introduced to our butler, Robert who looked after our every need. He made us feel completely relaxed and always had the time to talk to us. We must also mention Noel, our other butler who also help make our stay memorable.
All other areas of the hotel including the pool, restaurants and Sky bar are sensational but it will be the suite and service which we will remember the most. 
Would we like to stay again - definitely. In the meantime we would encourage everybody to treat themselves once in their life.","5","2014-02"
"Catered for eight admirably","We transferred to the Burj al Arab because we were fed up with five days of petty annoyances in the Atlantis.  We were a party or eight (4 adults, 2 15 year olds, 1 eleven year old and 1 two year old baby) staying for five days.  The Burj sent two complimentary Mercedes for the transfer (and an additional van for our luggage).  On arrival, we were greeted by name and immediately ushered to our three bedroom suite.  Check-in was a very minor formality consisting of handing over passports and signing one paper, all over in a minute.  The whole hotel is breath taking.  Our suite was on the 22nd floor, on two levels, with three double bedrooms and a special bed for the baby.  Nothing was too much trouble, with an individual attendant on our floor to see to our every need.  The rooms had complimentary wine and sweets and every toiletry you could imagine.  The views over Dubai from this height were spectacular.  We asked our butler to arrange a private tour of Dubai and Jumeira and this was organized within 30 minutes.  We can thoroughly recommend “Milan Tours, Dubai” for their attentive guide and personal driver during the four hour trip.  Complimentary cars to the airport ended a really nice holiday.
In summary a superb place, living up to its name as “the most luxurious hotel in Dubai”.","5","2014-02"
"Warning: you will be spoiled!","I have to start by saying I am an extremely picky and spoiled traveler! This is one hotel that I've always wanted to go to, ever since I heard it was the only 7 star hotel in the world. I have to say I was very impressed by the service. There were so many special touches that really make you feel special. From the bouquets of roses for the ladies to the full size hermes his and her toiletries to the little gifts each night at turn down! The staff in the whole hotel was amazing, they really were engaging and each one special. During breakfast we were sitting outside enjoying the scenery and some coffee and it was a little chilly out so he took my cup to refresh my coffee and brought it back in a warmed mug and warm cream to add. It was the small yet consistent things like that the make this place 7 stars! The only negative I would have to say is that the decor really needs refreshing and the technology in the rooms is outdated. The decor is very unique and interesting but just really needs a refresh. The air in the room felt stale and had a weird smell, not terrible but just not perfect. The sky bar also felt a little 90's. but the other restaurants were very beautiful!!

","5","2014-02"
"Afternoon tea","I had no chance to visit or to stay, however I was told to try the afternoon tea over, and I think that gonna be my next visit before ending up my vacation in this lovely city. 
I used to be around this attractive building and I really like watching it by midnight.","5","2014-01"
"BURJ AL ARAB, DUBIA","LIKED
1) THE DECOS
2)THE SERVICES
3)THE AMBIENCE

DISLIKED
1)PRICES are too high compared to other similar place in other parts of the world, example :HONG KONG :SHANGRILA , MARRIOT etc HOTELS ; RITZ in SINGAPORE, ATLANTIS in Bahama......
2)BOOKING procedure is too tedious
3)Advance credit card payment sounds not in keeping with  a 7stars (so claimed!)  HOTEL statues!!!","4",
"Living Fabulously","This hotel is truly the most beautiful experience anyone could hope for.  We spent a few days here on our way to the Maldives in celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary, and it was absolutely worth the time spent.  Too many times you see pictures online and then reality is a far cry from what you see when you arrive.  That is certainly not the case here.  From the minute you walk into the gorgeous lobby until the moment of checkout, you will have an experience that will last a lifetime.  We were picked up at the airport by a Mercedes from the hotel. The driver had flowers for me, was helpful and knowledgeable, and considered our every need (even giving us the option of what type of music to listen to).  The check-in in our room was fantastic.  No standing in line waiting for the next available.  It was late at night when we arrived after a 13 hour flight, and we certainly appreciated going right to our suite.  Of course, the suites are phenomenal.  It felt very much like we were in a very up-scale sheik's residence.  We did a corner suite, so we had the Persian Gulf on one side and the city on the other.  Really, no words could describe it. The butler service was impeccable. Answered every question we had.  Really only used the concierge service once, as all our information came from the butler.  Only reason we used it that time was because we just happened to be in the lobby.  I am not easily impressed.  We have traveled around the world, and staying in a 4 or 5 star hotel is our norm.  This place blew us away.  Nothing else like this in the world!  Thanks to all the staff who were always smiling and made us feel right at home.","5","2014-01"
"Paradise","Had the privilege of staying here for 2 nights , wonderful would be an understatement . Right from entry in the hotel you are addressed by your second name , the laser fountain in the lobby is just too good , the underwater restaurant, the bar on 27th floor is amazing and gives a complete view of Dubai. And wait the personal butler in the room , a 2 floor room, with amazing view, the dark blue and yellow interiors which don't pinch your eye, and Hermes toiletries , i can go on and on .... Must stay to live the experience ","5","2013-03"
"Worst experience","Okay, I didn't stay here ever, so I am writing this review as of terms of visiting quality.
1-And only- The people at the guardhouse were very unpleasant and impolite, as they said we aren't guests and we would have to make meal reservations. We told them to book us under lunch, and she said lunch hour just finished. We asked if we could get a tour of the lobby, and she responded, ""I'm sorry, but the lobby is closed for Ramadan."" We drove away saying that we hated people too arrogant and proud of themselves.","1","2014-01"
"Paradise!!","The hotel is out of the world its a stand alone property with watermark and its a palace which has almost everything.i would appericiate the behaviour of the staff as they are very helpful.truly a 7 star property.","5","2014-01"
"Understated luxury...not!!","This is the epitome of great hotels, your own butler in a duplex room, bath run for you just as you like, mirror above the bed, fabulous views...everything you'd expect from a 7 star hotel and more","5",
"HEAVEN ON EARTH","Just returned from Dubai and the best thing was the Burj Al Arab Hotel. It truly is the finest run property from the moment of arrival to your departure. The rooms are like Park Ave luxury apartments. Our standard King was a 2 story marvel. Plush, large rooms with no detail missed. Sweeping marble staicase with custom hand made steel railings. Even the amenities were over the top- Sail shaped boxes with Dates and a second box of assorted Baklavah. Of course champagne and complimentary exotic fruits. We had a magnificent view of the arabian sea and coastline. Although expensive the ""Winter Dreams"" package had over $1200.00 in amenities. If possible save up and experience this slice of perfection!  As far as Dubai it was Las Vegas on steroids with shopping instead of casinos. Dubai's only saving grace was the endless soft white sand clean beaches. Don't expect too much arabian culture it is very sanitized city with no camels anywhere. There are plenty of Rolls, bentleys and Ferraris instead.","5","2014-02"
"Still a gem, however a bit old a bit lack of service","Booked three bedroom delux suite for one night. The architecture, interior(a bit old), and the mood are excellent and reminds of tale arabian prince house. However, the service does not live up to expectations. 

When we checked in I asked for kids bed( do not know why it was not there, worse hotels put the bed in right away). When we came from dinner there was no bed, so I asked again, waited for half an hour for them to come. The family was sleepy in bath robes and waiting for kids bed.when they came we stood there with robes and waited till three guys prepare the bed. 

The hotel feels cramped into little space. The swimming pool area is dissapointing and very small. The indoor pool, nice but too much chlorine and they let dressed up people from outside walk in to take a look while others are bathing. Sauna area is simple any medium level gym type. 

Well it is an experience to see the building, however the hotel is not a 7 not even a 5 star hotel. They have to try harder. And definitely not worth 9000 us dollars for a night even if you get a gold (old) ipad:))

The restaurant on the top floor is good and food is tasty, however the service pushy and makes you fell uncomfortable. They push to order more and more. I am looking after my food so one dish for dinner is enough for me, but they several times pushed me to order some more. They leave for a few minutes and then they come again to harrass us to order more. We irdered a champagne bottle, before even halfing it , three times with brakes they harrassed me about ordering wine and each time they recieved an answer that We have not finished our champagne yet. Of course they brought the dishes not at the same time. They gave one of us an appetizer and the other one chefs pretaste(my brother did not get one):)) there are better restaurants. ","3","2014-02"
"Burj Al Arab - AMAZING","I am a travel agent and recently visited Dubai for 9 nights.  You can't go to Dubai without going to the Burj Al Arab Hotel (The Iconic Sailboat Hotel) that sits on its own spot in the sea.
The only way to get into that hotel to see it is to have a suite reservation, a reservation for dinner in the restaurant, or a reservation in the Skyview Bar.  We went to the Skyview Bar.  They have a minimum that you have to spend, but I was determined to see that hotel.  
When you walk into the hotel its like it is dripping luxury!  First thing you see if a massive water fall, with escalators on either side of it.  Their vases on the tables don't really look like vases. All you see is red roses in different shapes.  Everything is gold to make is luxurious.  You cansee all the way to the top of the hotel in the middle with the suites on the outside.  They even have a private landing pad for a helicopter.  Thats for the person that stays int he most expensive suite.

We went up to the Skyview bar ina beautiful elevator and the bar was beautiful with windows all around.  Lots of color and the waiters there were so professional in their attire and the way they dealt with the customers.  The Bar menu is like 20 pages long listing every kind of Hard liquor (only the best), wine, mixed drinks, Champagne and Beer.  You are given a 3 tier dish with nuts and olives on it and a place of canapes. We were sat at a window seat and looked out at the ocean and city.  Simply Stunning!  

I can't say enough about good about our experience at this hotel.  Its stunning and well worth a visit to it!","5","2014-01"
"Dubai Hotel","For a 7 star hotel I thought it was a 2 star hotel, the food was terrible. I found that my themed meal was as average as my local pub. I am very sorry to the staff which I have to say was a brilliant experience but the woman behind the main desk accused my wife of steeling the towels when the maid took them out to be cleaned so please Burj Al Arab can you sort the woman out. Thank you.","1","2013-09"
"one should try if you can","The overall experience was great… breakfast outside in the mornings wonderful with great staff. The rooms were very beautiful, spacious, even double storey. Bathroom amenities all from Hermès for ladies and gents. Room service breakfast early am. before heading to the apt. was something. The seafood restaurant a bit disappointing? (Pricy and I would say not worth it).","5","2013-12"
"Excellent service and room","Stayed at the 2 bedroom suite for Chinese holiday. Even though the hotel is packed with people, the personal service is exceptional. Room is fantastic with a lot of space and a big living and sitting rooms. You should definitely check out their pool on 18th and downstairs because both pools give you completely different feelings about dubai, one relaxing and one overlooking dubai city. 

Will return to hotel despite of its high price. It worths every penny you spend. 

On a side note, the restaurant downstairs in the fish tank is a must.","5","2014-01"
"The only 7 star hotel in the world","Repeatedly voted the world's most luxurious hotel, this magnificent destination offers you the finest service and facilities throughout – right down to an optional chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce
Yet for all the wonder this stunning structure provides when you finally see it in person, it is the service within that really makes the Burj Al Arab so extraordinary.","5",
"Disappointing...avoid","Food is of high standard in room service and restaurants, although breakfast buffet is pretty average...(try Atlantis The Palm for a superb buffet)
For a supposed 7 star hotel, their accounts system is so poor that you have to sign room charge slip for a complimentary breakfast, and they promise to deduct from final bill... (It was deducted) but is that really most professional way to track guests usage of breakfast facilities? Make them sign 'false invoice charge' ... Poor procedure to force signature on incorrect invoice, so their accounts and audit dept get usage information... No follow up on my enquiry for status of Sirius membership, zero management feedback on above points when raised with junior staff... Pretty average service levels.. wifi service runs slow in suite on 7 th floor, had to use LAN cable,  lobby music can be heard all evening from inside suite on 7th floor, so make sure you insist on higher floors for quiet evening.... Visually, the hotel is opulent and well maintained, pity the details are not well executed. Overall poor,  my advice would be to get a signature suite at Atlantis The Palm..","2","2014-01"
"Overrated and posh","Everyone has been talking about Burj Al Arab for a few years, so it really is the symbol of Dubai and stands out as an architectural landmark! Really beautiful and has awesome views, though is it really worth the price?
All rooms have two floors, a bedroom, a huge living room and bathroom with traces of Arabic design! it is totally air conditioned so people who are dust allergic will not fully enjoy the stay. There is a butler on each floor to serve all your needs) And that really helps, as using Room Service is useless - takes ages and they dont really understand the demands. For example, we tried to order tomato soup and a kids meal from the restaurant, but they'd refused having one whereas our butler managed to organise it!
The best place in the hotel is the Spa, which you can visit even without staying. It has astonishing views and good treatment. The beach is nice and really clean, with a lovely buggy service. Unfortunately, most things are overpriced and not included (actually, paying for the room you only get the room)! And crowds of tourists in the lobby as its an attraction!
So be prepared to look great even if you are just strolling to the beach or are out of the Spa)
All and all, the hotel is nice to stay for a few days or to celebrate something though I'd never recommend it for a long holiday!","4","2013-11"
"Incredible weekend!","I was taken to this hotel as a birthday treat by my boyfriend. 

I can honestly say I have never had or probably will have a better hotel experience in my life!!!

There was constant surprises of flowers, cakes, birthday wishes and the most courteous, attentive staff.

Our suite was upgraded to a two bedroom duplex and you have to see to believe. Totally out of this world! 

We dined with friends in the seafood restaurant where we had a fantastic meal looking at the aquarium! 

Everything about the weekend was perfect. Breakfast was fantastic, by the water looking onto the wave hotel, very peaceful and relaxing. 

We smiled from ear to ear for 2 days and I will always remember the experience! 

I cannot put into words how incredible it truly was and this review does not do the burj Al Arab justice at all!","5","2014-01"
"Not what you will be thinking......","Went to the burj al Arab to have a spa session.  The session was great.  Sole use of the infinity pool, jacuzzi, steam / sauna etc and had one of the best massages.  Expensive at £130 but very good.  Went to burj al Arab to experience what it was like...all I can say is what a let down.  The place looks very tired.  Very Las Vegas and full of burly Russians charging about the place in football shirts.  Certainly not the classy and exclusive atmosphere they are after.  I am sure it was when it first opened but the nouveau rich are taking over.   The are many fantastic hotels with equally good facilities - I wouldn't bother having this on your Dubai itinery.","2",
"Fantastic and more!!","Everything one hears  about this hotel? It' has much much more to offer . I for one had visited to have dinner here 3 years ago, and thought it was overdone , over the top  and too showy.more of a show place than a place I wanted to stay in, but my husband who had stayed there for a business trip raved about it, I was skeptical, but was I very very pleasantly surprised?!!!'   With its unapologetic grandeur and overdone glamour to its service,  this is a truly luxurious hotel it's an experience. The trappings are all very obviously luxurious, the gold bathroom fittings, the duplex suites  overlooking the sea, incredibly luxe fabrics used for the curtains and the sofas, fabulous beds, yes,also  a gold framed mirror positioned directly over the bed!! It was the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept in. The bathroom had all Hermes toiletry, you get to take back his and hers Hermes perfumes too!!  Push of a button opened your yards and yards of curtain in a second another button pushed up your discreetly hidden tv for viewing , switches which dimmed and brightened the huge chandeliers. Nespesso machine in the living area, flowers on all the table tops, 3 different newspapers, fabulous welcome canapés served very elegantly, everything!! But for us this hotel truly stood out , because of its service. Such a famous hotel , a famous landmark the place for the glamorous and the rich, it could have become easily complacent, but no, the level of service and attention to detail that they have maintained is incredible. Rooms have butlers stationed outside with their own desk and computer , nothing was too difficult or too much trouble  for our butlers , emergency medicine needed , demand for another newspaper , request for another vase for flowers, arrangements for buggy to be taken to the other side, different coffee pods , at any hour, and all done efficiently smoothly and smilingly. This is the truly most luxurious aspect of the hotel which makes it stand apart from every other luxury hotel. To be able to keep this standard all these years is most highly commendable . Just the hype of this hotel can keep it going for years, but they have gone the extra mile and have put much effort into maintaining their  position as being one of the most glamorous and unique hotels of the world.","5","2014-01"
"Dubai 5 day trip","It was brilliant experience, foods, baverages, services, and environments are all deserved 7 stars hotel. but if the hotel could let guests take a short sightseeing with the hotel in different areas. maybe more people will choose Burj Al Arab to stay the next time they go to Dubai","5","2014-01"
"Burj Al-Amazing!","Visited the burj al arab, and in short have to say an amazing 7 star hotel. Amenities, food, service, view and luxury like no other! This is must do see in dubai, even if its for the amazing afternoon tea experience, or staying a night or 2 it is highly recommended. A jewel on the edge of the sea and magnificent luxury great enough for the sheikhs and modern man to marvel at. Great experience a must do in dubai!","5","2014-01"
"Dreamlike","We stayed on floor seven for two nights. Overall the experience was fantastic and the view of the city spectacular. The service was exceptional good and all the staff did their best at all times to make our stay at Burj Al Arab outstanding. The interior was a bit too much if you ask me , but then again I am european. When you stay there you get the feeling of being someone important, and that nothing is too luxurious for you. The room are enourmous and very clean. Our butler was fabolous and made our stay very pleasant. A big plus is that you get acess to the other hotels facilities in Jumeriah if you stay at the Burj Al Arab. The only thing is the price, I really don't know if the prices is relevant if you compare to what you get.","5","2014-01"
"Luxery trip with golfcar","The Burj Al Arab is not open to the public and it's on a peninsula, so you can't get close. But there is a rather affordable way to get in: high tea. If you order the high tea on the top floor, you can enter the hotel and do some ' site seeing'. And yeah, everything that looks like gold, is actually gold. but the best thing, we were staying in the Jumeirah hotel next door and they will take you to the Burj Al Arab in a golfcar. It's funny how tourist at the gate (entrance to the peninsula) look like you're a filmstar when your 'limo' brings you to the gate and it opens for you!
Food wise, the High tea is excellent and the view is magnificent. While we were there, a real fimstar must have been coming or going, because we saw the helicopter landing op the special platform...","5",
"Amazing place","We stayed on floor seven, the view of the city is amazing. The place is a bit in your face and staff are in the room much more than any other hotel we have stayed at. The sleep quality is fantastic and the overall experience is very pleasant. If we return to Dubai I may choose the place over the bridge and to the right as that seemed more relaxing. This place does have the best breakfast ever mind you.","5","2013-03"
"Didn't stay there","I went to visit a friend staying at the Burj Al Arab and we had a hard time getting in. After much, we entered the hotel and to my disappointment the lobby is small. There didn't seem to be much to the hotel. We went up their floor where we meg the floor butler who also had to view our IDs before letting us go to the room ( even with my friend right there). At this point I figured the room would be spectacular. I was a bit let down when I got in. The views were spectacular but the decor seemed a bit dated to me. The rooms were spacious and the bath rooms  very large. But I feel that yellow, blue, white and gold in one room is a bit over the top. For the amount you would be paying at the Burj Al Arab you can have a modern hotel with more contemporary decor! I wouldn't stay there..","3",
"This is how service should look like!","All the way from check-in to the last goodbyes, this is how a hotel of this caliber should work. Everybody knew your name, everybode treating you in a manner I have never seen in a hotel!
The room was enormous, tidy and neat! May seem like an overkill from some pictures but in reality it's pretty decent and unobtrusive.
The breakfast at Junsui was probably the best I ever had and will have!
The facilities are awesome, unfortunately I did not have enough time to try the spa and the pool. Al Muntaha restaurant was marvelous, nicely decorated and I'm not even mentioning the view..
Special thanks to Olga for taking care of my reservation, Konstantina and Anna for taking care of us throughout our short stay and showing us around and the gentleman who showed us the whole lot our room has to offer.
I cannot wait to come back to Dubai and here!","5","2014-01"
"Third stay and excellent as usual","The Burj Al Arab is consistently excellent.  We stayed in a panoramic suite, though we have stayed in a ""standard"" suite (if you can call it that)  which was also superb.  Panoramic suites are  the corners of the building so you really are treated to the most spectacular views.  

On arrival we were ushered straight to our suite where red wine, dates and fruit awaited.  We were then asked if we preferred white wine and we accepted the offer.  It is very hard to leave your suite....  we did eventually and headed for the pool which is not huge but private and quiet- cold towels etc on offer. During our three night stay we also went to the beach where we had beds in the shade and sun, so you can swap between the two.

We have stayed at Jumeirah Beach hotel on a number of occasions too and we enjoyed the lap pool there, BA gives you access which we also made the most of.  On this occasion we ate at Al Muntaha after cocktails in the Sky Bar.  We noticed that food is now served in the Sky Bar which has made it a little busier than our last visit and made a window side seat more difficult to obtain.

Breakfast was varied and good but strictly buffet style, though you could choose your eggs and they will bring them to you.  I suppose if I had to find a constructive criticism, I would prefer an a la carte breakfast, but that is just picky!

The butlers were excellent as always.  We do like to pack and unpack ourselves, so we did not keep them too busy.

Full size Hermes Perfumes and toiletries on arrival as usual.

All in all this hotel and Al Maha are our destinations of choice in a busy Dubai for a treat.  Have just joined TA hence the belated review.","5","2013-06"
"2nd time was a treat","this was our second time here after 10 years and an anniversary occasion for one night only. Once again we were treated like royalty (which is what you expect here) We were looked after from the start and were given an early check in as requested..I went straight to the steam room and pool on the 18th floor which is the best. The concierge, staff and butlers were always happy to help out and please us...Thank you for the wedding anniversary greeting card, chocolate cake and flowers from the Manager! this was a great surprise and it's always the little details that you remember most. They even let us order Pizza delivery for our friends that visited us in the evening. Also great assistance from our chauffer to the airport..Good times..Love the Burj!","5","2014-01"
"Fantastic","Says it all- nothing is better than this - its just amazing.

Had the best trip - great rooms, people, staff and scenery 

The private beach is a must!

Also, the service is great! Just ask them for anything and it works !","5","2013-07"
"Wonderful experience","We stayed here in a panoramic room for 5 nights in August. The fun began at the airport when we were collected by a Mercedes S class. In no time we were at the hotel being greeted by numerous smiling faces and we were treated like royalty (which we are not!)

Check-in was in the suite by the butler - there is one butler for every floor.

The room was just stunning. Split over two floors, it was the height of opulence. Beautiful sleeping area, wonderful bathroom with gold plated taps and a delightful mural on the wall. Great view from enormous windows. It was just the height of luxury.

I never thought about the merits of the butler, but I soon saw the point. They were extremely helpful and friendly - they always carried our bags and unlocked the door for us.

But, they were very smart. They engaged us in conversation and subconsciously found out our dining tastes. Then, restaurants were suggested - and even sometimes booked speculatively just so we didn't miss out! It made life so easy for us and greatly enhanced our stay. They were just so eager to help.

We often thought about visiting the BAA but were put off by a misconception. I thought there was a strict dress code in place at all times. However, you can take the lift to the ground floor and come out at the pool level without needing to dress up.

The dress code is more relevant for dining - you will need a suit (gents) and nice dress (ladies) to eat at al-Mahara - the seafood restaurant.

We were a bit sad to check out at the end of our stay there. We had been treated so well by everyone - the staff are just so professional and friendly. It is rare to feel so welcome and valued but we felt at home here.","5","2013-08"
"Disappointed with the experience","Burj Al Arab is Overrated. We had lunch and had to wait quite a bit to get a date for our lunch. Getting into the hotel is itself full of security red tape. The lunch is ridiculously overpriced and very disappointing. Rather skip a visit to this restaurant and had look at the rooms which are very gaudy and again overpriced. In my previous visit stayed at Atlantis which I feel is far more superior.","4",
"Stunning","Unique hotel , excellent restaurant with unbelievable fish tank .internal waterfall great but the submarine is truly tacky","5",
"Very Aesthetically pleasing","Beautiful building especially seen from the private beaches at Madinat or Jumeirah beach hotel. If you're staying at any Jumeirah hotel you should be able to get a complimentary day pass to either of the beaches but if you're not staying it may even be worth paying to use the beach facilities (pool, buggies, beach, towels etc) and to get up close and personal to the Burj Al Arab","5",
"Different","The burn was iconic when built in 1999 and still has a lot to offer the very rich.  The normal suites are special but time and other hotels are catching up.  Now the Royal suites are something else with there sweeping staircases and kitchens also room for the chef or maid. I like the fact that you can answer the door bell and lt the butler in without leaving your bed which swivels to save changing place. Very nice don't judge the Burj by the odd visit to the restaurants or just going to see the fountain explode it is much more behind the scenes I have been privilege to see even though I could not afford to stay over night.","5",
"Great Hotel, only if you can get in.","The hotel is actually does not feel that big when you get in.  It has a strict access control so unless you stay there or to have business (dining, manicure, afternoon tea, etc.) you are not allow to ""drop-in"".

The building looks nice from outside.  The view from the top floor is also very good.  The foyer is splendid.","5",
"A&R in UAE","Extremely nice experience! Nice to enjoy luxorious service now and then in the life. Staff really take care of you and your needs. The second stay was as good as the first one in Feb 2014. For sure want to go back.","5","2014-01"
"Best hotel we have stayed in so far...","Yeah, expensive it is. But you get what you paid for. This is an amazing hotel, both architectural and in decor, and amenities. The rooms are unbelievable, we had a two-floor panoramic suite but my understanding is that all rooms have also two stories. The in room stair makes you feel like you are in a palace. Service was outstanding, butler available at all times, anything we ordered we received in the room within seconds. Toiletries are certainly upscale. Hermes signature toiletries all over. 
Restaurants were very good, breakfast had more variety of food in the Asian restaurant compared to the pool restaurant. We liked it a lot. The views from the room were great. The curtains were a little bit slow to be raised through the automatic system, but I guess that was not a big deal.
Overall the best hotel we have ever stayed in, and we have travelled a lot all over the world. Difficult to beat as the best hotel option in Dubai, however, many other hotels in the same resort area offer comparable service for less money. But if you want the best, stop looking. This is it.","5","2013-06"
"Excellent Hotel in Dubai","I stay this hotel for 3 night and I can say There is no better hotel in World better than this hotel. Till Airport Welcome to Hotel I receive excellent service. I can say I receive same service that listed in hotel website. Personal Butler Service is excellent in any little things they help me. I come with Child and there are many things like Wild Wadi Water Park, Sind Bad there we can go with child.","5","2013-11"
"Our honeymoon stay","We stopped here on our last  day on honeymoon got free upgrade to panoramic 1 bed room  free Hermes goods aftershave perfume best views over gulf best place to stay love this place would go again soon x","5","2013-07"
"Amazing experience but not worth the dosh","I was fortunate enough to be treated to a night at the Burj al Arab so ironically it wasnt my dosh that was spent at this hotel! Nevertheless I reviewed it as if it were.

Its an incredible experience driving up to the much acclaimed Burj, which you usually only are able to view from afar. As you would expect per the many emails you have seen, the experience is very grand and the hotel impressive.

The Suites are laid out very spaciously to avoid you having to bump into any neighbours at all. The butler was right outside my suite which was very helpful as I can be high maintenance at times!

I unfortunately found the rooms dated and dont feel that much has changed since the hotel opened. Finishes are high quality, however the design is not my taste. I have stayed at beautiful ""traditional arab"" desigined suites before that managed to marry modern concepts and traditional, however this was not one of them. Furniture was big and bulky, with colours too bold and outdated. The bathroom too, however magnificent the marble was, didn't quite meet my expectations. The shower was massive however the drain incredibly noisy. I found the bedroom a bit drab with no wow factor, and for an 8000 dirham a night suite, one would expect many wow factors. 

Yes the staircase and chandeliers were impressive, but my statement above still stands.

Breakfast was extremely disappointing. If you have had the honour of dining at the Palace at the Lost City in Sun City, you would know what a 7* breakfast is. The breakfast on offer barely made 5* star standard. The breakfast area wasnt even impressive save for the beautiful view of the sea. I was however delighted to see many friendly South African staff

On the plus side, the lashings of Hermes toiletries in the bathroom brought me much delight and was worth the baggage excess I had to pay! (massive bottles (as opposed to the hotel accustomed miniatures) of Terry D'Hermes (male) shaving cream, after shave balm, deodorant, perfume, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, and the same in Kelly (female) sans the shaving toiletries. There were tons of beuatiful boxes thorughout the suite with baklavas and arab suites (which unfortunately could not fit into my luggage). Service was always excellent.

I will not negate that the hotel is magnificent however the surrounding hotels are just as impressive, offers similar facilities and splendours at a ""fraction"" of the price. 

I will return after a renovation (fingers crossed).","5","2013-12"
"What an experience","We stayed here for my honeymoon in September. Check in was quick and easy in the suite itself. Kind and helpful staff, slightly strange when the private butler offered to polish our shoes and unpack our suitcase (refused of course). High tea was amazing, tastiest lamb I've ever tasted in my life!!! Free access to wild wadi water park which is walking distance from the hotel. Couldn't go to their main signature restaurant because my husband didn't have a suit to fit the dress code so opted for smart casual at their buffet restaurant, defo not worth the price. Eat elsewhere!! Apart from that everything else was amazing, spacious suits over two floors, pure luxury. This is the place to be if you can afford £1000 a night or even just for the high tea, an experience you'll never forget. ","5","2013-09"
"Perfect","The best service we ever had in the Emirates,nothing is impossible,all the stuff are doing their best to make you feel at ease.There is never a NO as a first answer.The rooms are huge(the price also,but Worth it),nothing is missing to make you feel at home.
The beach is very nice and you can enjoy the open sea as opposed to the Palm.
We tried several of the restaurants,they were all nice and service at the top but not oustanding.If you find yourself at Jusui next to a group of noisy uneducated and unpolite Chinese group,your evening might be spoilt.
The bustours organized for the Chinese visiting the hotel are also a nuisance!I saw a mothee handing a plastic bottle to her son who peed in it in front of the guests.A luxury hotel should not be Disneyworld or some kind of museum for outside guests.","5","2013-12"
"High Tea","A lovely high tea at the burj al arab.
Refreshing sparkling date juice and plenty of tasty finger sandwiches and sweets selection. 
The staff are very professional and really look after you. You are not made to rush and can take as long as you like. you can also have a loong around on the floor of the restaurant where there are shops and fountains. 
really enjoyed ourselves","5","2013-04"
"Santa at the Burj Al Arab","This was our third Xmas in the hotel and one of the best...we know many of the staff now and this is a big part of our trip. Picked up as always on time, delivered safely to the doormen, escorted to our suite, breakfast in Bab Al Yam with Sumi and her team. The beach bar was fab on Christmas Day watching all the fun and festivities run by Satish and Santosh and their team..well done guys..we had our Xmas Dinner in Al Iwan and better than hotels in Scotland re prices, service and food. That's one of the reasons we keep coming back. As always my biggest thank you must go to Nimal in reservations and he knows why....🎄🎄🎅🎅🎅
Where do you go from here I keep asking myself 😉😉","5","2013-12"
"Simply superb","The best hotel I have ever stayed in. The service is beyond impeccable and the rooms were incredibly spacious. You pay for it though - at £1,300 per night (Xmas season), this is by far the most expensive room I have ever booked, but I have to say I came away feeling it was kinda worth it!?!! Pool area is lovely - a tad small, given the size of the hotel, but they do also have their own beach. At both you receive cooler with bottles of water, glasses with ice, cold face towels and spring water facial spray cooler - lovely! Sweets and fruit also free in both these areas. Make use of the buggies - they're great. We really felt like royalty and received and impeccably personal service. Would definitely stay here again. ","5","2013-12"
"Simply the Best!","If you are ever traveling to Dubai, a stay at the Burj Al Arab is a must.  We stayed at the Atlantis before our cruise and at the Burj Al Arab after the cruise.  From the moment we arrived until the time we left, we were impressed with every detail of our stay.  The public areas and the rooms are over the top with impressive decoration and detail.  We stayed in a two bedroom suite that had no only a bar, living room, dining room with a powder room, office with desk, fax and laptop, and elevator.  We never needed to use our room key because every time we got off of the elevator we were greeted by our butler.  The views from our room were amazing.  Floor to ceiling windows gave a very expansive view.  We even had a party in our suite for the people that we met on the cruise. The staff were very helpful and pleasant.  I agree with their self-proclaimed 7 stars!","5","2013-01"
"Total Luxurious experience and awesome services","Stayed at the Burj Al Arab for 2 nites.  It was a total awesome experience.  King and queen treatment from the start and each room will get a personal butler who will attend to your request. You get to check in inside your own room and total attention is on you only.  Gosh..at times I felt so overwhelmed.  Totally no complaints about the top notch services and we did dined at one of the restaurants on the 27th floor.  Food quality was good and needless to say about the service, again top notch.  Before we left the hotel after checked out, we ate at the poolside cafe.  The food was not so good though but can't complain about the service.  Guess for that price of money paid for room and all, the service and all had better be top!","5",
"Wow.....what an absolutely delightful experience","Well, what can I say, as no amount of words can describe just what a wonderful hotel this  happens to be - a stunning bedroom suite with amazing views, and the most caring and attentive staff that really made our stay a truly memorable one. What began as a 'one off' surprise stay for my husband's special birthday, has now turned into a 'when can we go back again'.  Some things in life are just 'priceless' and this experience happens to be one of them.  My advice is....go, go, go  and find out for yourself, you will not be disappointed.","5","2013-12"
"a sight to see..amazing","the actual building itself was amazing and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.cocktails were delicious, Great view, great atmosphere, great service.It's a real joy. Not rushed at all and excellent service as you would expect. Not a cheap option but a great afternoon.
 So glad we took the opportunity to experience a stay at the Burj! 

will definetly recommend this","5",
"Over the Top Dubai","Don't know what more can be added than has already been said.  In a word, radical . . . The living room, dining room and office were connected to the upstairs bedroom and bath suite by a marble staircase, both with a view of the sea.  Private beach with shark-net and kayak lifeguards.  Watched a helicopter land on the helipad from where Tiger Woods famously drove long woods.  The butler was a bit more obtrusive, as another reviewer commented, than one might prefer.  We stayed here only one night; they want 2 nites minimum, but I didn't have time to take out a second mortgage on the house, so they relented.  The language spoken here is RUSSIAN, not Arabic or anything else.  All the fixtures are covered in gold, which was off-putting to me.","4","2013-11"
"Pure Opulence","I liked that all units are suits, including an office, dressing room, etc, so you can feel close to being at home in your :mansion,"" though there was a lot of gold everywhere which did not bother me so much but I know folk who find that distasteful.","5",
"WORLDS 7*  HOTEL","We spent 2 nights in this luxury stunning Hotel.  We travel a lot and we had a chance to visit amazing hotels around the world  . Burj Al Arab  is truly the most awesome hotel  we’ve ever been. From arrival to departure everything was perfect. Each floor has the personal  butler 24 hrs , excellent  staff and service, each one of the team makes you feel so special . You don’t have to be  a Celebrity ,You will  feel like a  King  or  a Queen. The attention to detail made  all  the difference. Our gorgeous huge duplex suite( 6 floor-number: 605      ) exceeded high expectations ,latest Hi Tech facilities, individual IMac( free wi-fi)  and  luxurious  full size for him/and her perfumes and bathroom accessories from Hermes . 
Once we were dining in Al Muntaha restaurant located on the 27th floor. A little disappointing experience because of food and view. We had cream  soup ,shrimps, and two  kind of fish. Honestly was very  average and overpriced .We were seated  away from  the window and  we missed out on the view. Last evening we had dinner buffet in Jansui Far East Asian restaurant , AED 425.00 per person. The food was truly delicious . Highly  recommend. Small swimming pool but beautiful long , wide sandy beach.
Generally great experience.","5","2013-11"
"Best vacation ever","I dont work for Burj Al Arab hotel or Jumeirah group :) but i do recommend this hotel to who ever can offered it as the best hotel to experience, we spent one long weekend recently and it was amazing, not only the rooms and the facilities but the team, each one of them makes you feel so special and they do all what can be done to assure your happiness

My little daughter Tiana (7 years old) who had the chance to visit amazing hotels around the world, told me at the end of our first night that this day was the 2nd happiest day of her life (i asked her what is the 1st one and she said when she was born :)) 

My wife had tears in her eyes when the team made a surprise for us when we were celebrating our 8th year marriage anniversary, they are amazing

Thank you Burj Al Arab team for all your efforts to make us feel that special and spend amazing time with you

regards
Husni","5","2013-12"
"A sight to see","This place is definitely a sight to behold. The interior is amazing. You can't see it when you first walk in, but go to the 2nd floor and you see the fountain and the crazy, colorful floors.

It's worth the reservation to see this place. And they don't lie about the 7 star hotel and its service all throughout. 

I have more love for the hotels and bars in Hong Kong personally, but this is alright. Worth trying.","4","2013-12"
"Great, but..","Staying as a resident at this iconic hotel is a privilege. The suites are amazing, with many little touches to create a truly memorable experience, the staff are attentive and courteous but.. while the private resident areas are fine, the very large number of non-resident visitors sometimes makes the public parts of the hotel, and some of the restaurants- most notably the Junsui Asian restaurant- like visiting a Chinese airport.
The Bab al Yam restaurant is great for breakfast, with amazing service and a real desire to please. The outside tables seem to be all 'smokers tables', which can be unpleasant for some non-smokers.
The poolside area is small but very pleasant, again with very attentive service. The outside lunch menu is a little disappointing, especially given the proximity of several kitchens with clearly talented chefs.
The gym is excellent, with a wide range of equipment, both cardio and weights, and again the staff service is superb.
A larger selection of wines by the glass or half bottles would be wise given the large number of couples visiting, the high class cuisine and the knowledgeable sommeliers.","4","2013-11"
"Best hotel I've ever stayed at","This was by far the coolest hotel I have ever stayed at in my life. I have been all around the world and Dubai was by far one of the coolest places. There really is so much to do just around the hotel. Anything that we needed we were a button push away and our floor butler handled everything! AMAZING! One of the best experiences we had at the hotel was the helicopter tour off of the helipad on the top of the Burj, a little pricey but it is a once in a lifetime experience. You will get a tour around the ""World"" of islands and the palm tree islands as well. Highly recommend staying at the Burj Al Arab when visiting Dubai!","5",
"I was truly disappointed","After the expectations were so high, I was absolutely dissatisfied with the mediocre level of service. 
The hotel architecture is magnificent and definitively it is a unique building. Watch out, nothing remain forever without the proper care and you can see how the time is taking a toll on the unique structure. 
When I arrive there was no one to open my car door or help me, as a matter of fact once you pass the gate control which is kind of like getting through the spices market you basically on your own. The restaurant on the top floor is not bad but the waitress lack the basic training that a high standard of service requires. That include not pushing anything on the menu even if it is as good as it resulted to be because what we remember after the visit is no how good was the recommendation but how pushy and bad trained was the waitress. I have to admit that I was not impress and I am planning my new year eve vacations and I am definitively not coming back to the Burj","3","2013-10"
"Luxury","Luxury at its best.One of the lifetime experience i had.From charter plane to mercedes ,all attracts you.
Service ,technology,facilities are just amazing...a world within world.","5","2013-11"
"I like this hotel and come back every year.","We visited this hotel 4 times. My favourite time for visiting Dubai is December and March. The weather in this time is warm. Burj al Arab is my favourite hotel in Dubai. I like all things in this hotel: Rolls-Roys transfer, butlers who can foresee what you wish, restaurants, especially Friday brunches, presents for children, train with sweets. I like beach with warm sand. And I like pillows, which incredibly soft and airy. May be someone want to say that now hotel a little bit decay, but I think it is the best hotel in Dubai until now!!! If you stay in Burj al Arab, you can go to another hotels of Jumeirah chain. My children spend their time in Wild Wadi waterpark (free entrance for people, who stay in Burj al Arab, Jumeirah beach hotel, Al Qasr, Dar al Masiaf, Mina a salam). Visit this hotel, stay there and you understand that all guest for them - are royalty.","5","2013-03"
"The Real Heaven ...","A world class hotel ...probably the best hotel rating in the world ... the real experience to be there at underwater restaurant ... awesome ... 

202 luxurious duplex suites
Personalised butler service
Eight world-class restaurants and bars
Four swimming pools (two outdoor, two indoor) and a private beach
Assawan Spa & Healthclub
Rolls Royce, Mercedes and helicopter airport transfer service
Complimentary access to Wild Wadi Waterpark for the duration of your stay","5","2013-01"
"nice, but could be better","They have done everything right for a top class hotel. Service, food, interiors, ambience, etc etc. 
The one thing i found disappointing was the escorting from the security gate till the hotel main door. It is a total chaos. They will tell u to walk all the way - which is quite a distance - if the golf cart is not available. This is pretty strenuous if you are visiting in the afternoon when the sun is out. 
The same thing goes when escorting out. If it gets a little crowded outside for Taxi, there is no proper queue and taxis are alloted at random. (There was this guard called Kiran standing out and he had no clue what was going on). 
If you are paying a fortune, you expect everything to work with clockwork precision. 
So, if you have plans after Burj Al Arab and are planning to take a taxi, make sure you have  enough margin (1.5 hours) because it is very hard to find a taxi quickly enough from there.","3",
"7 stars !","Now... come to think of it... THIS IS HEAVEN!  A whole suite... a personal butler 24hrs. The best hotel rating in the world. I was speechless when I walked into this royalty. Marble... gold... carpets.. your name on the TV when switched on with a welcome note.  Wine and fresh fruit.  I really did not want to leave here. I could move and stay here for ever!  One just can not describe the royalty of this hotel.","5","2013-05"
"Good rooms","Huge rooms much too expensive to afford it has really nice staff nice hotel nice beach nice spa nice everything nice food cheap mini bar room service is great tv has lots of channels and movies to watch for FREE and ask a staff to hire a Xbox or play station for FREE the lights that shine on the hotel are AMAZING","4","2012-12"
"Absolutely out of this world !","I'm sitting in our deluxe suite 904 writing this in the most luxurious surroundings sadly waiting for our airport transfer.
We were collected in a Rolls Royce Phanthom which was an amazing experience in itself and when we arrived at The Burj we were greeted by extremely friendly staff who escorted straight to our suite. I have to say in our our years of staying in luxurious hotels noting prepared us for this ! It's the most fabulous room I've ever seen and fit for a king. Full size his and hers Hermes perfume and toiletries in a bathroom bigger than I've ever seen. 
We were a Little dubious about spending 10 days here as we were told it was ostentatious and formal . That couldn't be further than the truth. This is such a friendly hotel, nothing was too much trouble and they made such a fuss over our 10 year old daughter. The beach area was equally wonderful, Amjad had our beds saved every morning and a constant supply of chilled water . The gym and spa breath taking .
The food at the hotel- breakfasts and beach lunches were delicious . I have so much more praise for this hotel. In a nut shell you are cocooned in luxury and personal service that is second to none. We stayed with Jumeirah hotels for 15 years but this was our first Burj experience and Im very certain now it won't be our last ... Maybe June!!! Thank you everyone at the Burj for a dream holiday x","5","2013-10"
"Over the top excellence","If you put aside your garish colour and gold overdose prejudices then this is a tremendous place to stay. Service is as good as anything you will experience at any hotel anywhere. 
This was the first time we had stayed sans kids but in fact it is perfect for families given the large duplex layout. Kids sleep on the ground level with couples upstairs giving necessary separation.
The pool area is small but private. Only downside to the size is that in the weekends loungers are hard to come by due to the influx of marginally obnoxious expat locals who have access due to membership of the Jumeirah Beach Club. The hotel should give priority to hotel residents. Another negative is that currently the private beach area is now squashed between the JBH beach and the Executive Club beach due to the new hotel being built. Management allege that Burj residents will get their own private area back by the end of 2014.
The negatives still do not outweigh what is a highly recommended experience.","5","2013-10"
"Out of this World!!","Wow! what can be said about this hotel that has not already been said?
Awesome, breath taking, stunning, luxurious, opulent -the list goes on.
We stayed here for the final two nights of our trip to Dubai. This was part of my partner's 50th birthday celebrations and was indeed  the icing on the cake !
We had a suite as I expect everyone in the Burj does?
We were located on the 6th floor.
Each floor has 12 suites and a butler assigned to each floor. He /she sits at the entrance to all the suites on each floor level.
The suites are decked out in GOLD!! The theme is Blue. Red and Gold.
Never ever have I stayed in such a beautiful extagavant place as here.
Some say its over the top, but if you are paying £1,000 a night EACH then you would expect it to be wouldn't you??????????
Anyway, we will probably never ever stay here again, as its obviously the playground of the rich and famous, but weve had atast of how the other half lives and it was fantastic!
The staff here cannot do enough for you.
You will want for NOTHING!! Anytime day or night
If you want to spoil your special lady, then ( even if its only for a night) you MUST stay here","5","2013-10"
"Feel like Royalty","From the moment we landed our chauffeur in his Rolls Royce was waiting with a bouquet of flowers, this truly was an unforgettable experience, we had the panoramic suite with fresh fruit everyday, electric curtains, 2 floors, and the strong fragrance of freshly cut Stargazer Lillie's,  we had our own personal butler and a courtesy buggy for whizzing within the Jumeira Area. It was the ideal place for a honeymoon, a memory that will last forever.","5","2013-08"
"Incredible","My godmother and I stayed at Burj Al Arab on her recent visit to Dubai.  She has terminal cancer and this was most likely her last journey abroad and my last time to see her.  The staff was aware of her condition and made the experience more than I could have ever hoped for.  Her ever need was met with a smile, as well as care and concern.  I cannot being to express my gratitude for their amazing service to both of us.  I can't think of anything that would have made this experience better.","5","2013-10"
"Amazing experience","Of course - very expensive, but really an amazing experience and stay.  We felt at home right from arriving at the front entrance.  The service was attentive but not over done and the atmosphere was very relaxed by the pool, gym and breakfast restaurant. There were so many little touches in the room that made the stay feel very different to a normal hotel stay.  The views from our room were breath taking.  So glad we  took the opportunity to experience a stay at the Burj!","5","2013-10"
"Excellent hotel","One of best hotels. Nice architecture. 
The lobby is beautifully designed with floor to ceiling aquariums.
Large beautiful suites that come in 2 floors. Rooms are richly decorated and have an air of opulence and high-tech, and a nice large fruit basket. There is a personal office and a personal butler. The breakfast buffet has probably the best spread in the world with exotic fruits from different continents.","5",
"Ship Shape","I have been lucky enough to have stayed at this hotel on a couple of occasions, first in 2004 then again in September 2013. Everyone knows the colour scheme and decor aren't for the faint hearted but once you relax in to your room while being made to feel like a VIP/rockstar you don't notice it.The staff really want you to have a special time. 

I have to concur with a previous reviewer who stated that going to high tea at a hotel is not staying at it and therefore any review(s) should be posted under food/restaurant not under hotel!

If you are fortunate enough to have stayed at this fantastic hotel you would know that very few of the guest would have high tea in the public areas but would take it in areas reserved for guests of the hotel only or in the living area of their suite! We liked having tea by the pool, followed by drinks in the room before dinner.

Thus when staying at the hotel it is a completely different experience to just visiting as a day tourist. I'm fortunate enough to been able to stay at a number of fine hotels around the world and while the decor is not one I would have in my home, the service and customer service is out of this world.","5","2013-09"
"It's not free to go in","You have to either stay there, or eat there (call for appointment ahead of time) in order to get in.  They check your name and reservation at the front gate before entering the bridge.

Service was nice and polite.  Free sample palm dates handed to you for tasting once you enter. Luxury beyond words.

Don't miss the free golf cart ride that take you to the hotel's private beach/canal.  It picks you up in front of the hotel.","4",
"beautiful majestic","one of the prettiest sites I've ever seen. beautiful architecture and views from the top. get there early to get a reservation.","4",
"Still the best!","Our first time at Burj was in 2004 and one word regarding our stay that time was 'Amazing'. Honestly I was a little bit afraid to be disappointed when we started to plan our trip this October but still decided to try this hotel after all these 9 years.
Well all I can say it is still the best! 
Our room was very clean with a great smell and very well maintained. There was no hint of a shabby feeling. Everything was new and fresh.
The service was great. Anything you need your butler gets for you.
The breakfast was very good, the variety was great (we tried only international buffet on the ground floor). 
The only irritating issue was the shops which were everywhere, on the way to the lobby, on the way to the breakfast and pool. Too much! The shops don't add an exclusive feeling at all.
The beach was nice, spacious, with a good service.
Overall it was again a wonderful stay which I still want to repeat one day...","5","2013-10"
"Totally over the top","This hotel is so amazing that it is verging on the ridiculous.  There is no doubt that it is a fabulous experience to stay here.  The facilities are first rate, the rooms absolutely enormous and very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful - perhaps too much so.  My main criticism is that the staff are obviously instructed to be SO attentive and helpful that at times this can feel a bit suffocating.  Sometimes you feel as though you just want them to do their job quickly and efficiently and then to be left alone!  The result of this, in my view, is that the hotel does not have the relaxed sophistication of top European hotels, for example.  In fact, with the decor, which is clearly expensive but very gaudy, sophistication is not the word that springs to mind at all.  It is extremely impressive, but totally over the top.  However, that is what this place is all about - an experience.  We have even stayed a few nights with our two young children (in a suite which was bigger than our house) on a couple of occasions which is fine, although for an extended stay there are more family-friendly hotels in Dubai than this one.  Really though, it's great fun.","5","2013-06"
"A nice experience but overated","As you know it’s a fantastic hotel with great views and architecture. It's certainly worth a visit but nothing more than that. If you want to impress someone or celebrating a very special moment, this is a great place to do that. The rooms are very comfy to say the least. The restaurants serve ok food. but if you are hoping to get blown away by the food, you will be disappointed. For the price you pay, there are so many restaurants around Dubai who serve much better food. The Sky view Bar, Al Muntaha (contemporary French) & Al Mahara are the favorites. Most people who goes to Al muntaha and Sky view Bar for the view end up disappointed because you really can’t see a thing in during Dinner except for few table who see a bit of the nearby hotels. If you are there for the view you should go there during lunch and you will have a fantastic view or you can go to Al mahara during dinner and dine with the fish. Over all, it’s a very good experience.","4","2012-11"
"My Fav Hotel","This hotel is fabulous. The friendly staff the great decor and the amazing rooms. The price is expensive but you pay for what you get. In the rooms you got free Hermes goodies etc. Free wild wadi passes. The restaurants within the hotel are very good and overall would be going back so soon. The view from the rooms of the sea is to die for. The hotel staff  did everything for us and with your own buttler on each floor you cant complain. Its a really good hotel even with family as the rooms are so big. Everyone has something to do. Will be coming back very soon.","5","2013-07"
"Still the closest to perfection!","I stayed at the Burj Al Arab for a second time after some years.
It was once again a near to perfection stay right from being picked up at the airport by Rolls Royce to check out after 3 nights.
The room was still in very good shape, no signs of deterioration over the years.
The staff was fantastic, very friendly and competent.
I personaly thought the breakfast in the Asian restaurant was a bit boring, it was mainly made for Chinese guests. The breakfast in Bab Al Yam is very special, not huge, but very good quality.

The only disappointment was the food we had in the Beach Restaurant, this is not up to Burj Al Arab standards. I think they know and are working on it to improve.

Stay a few nights, if you can afford it, a lot better than just one night.
See you again...","5","2013-09"
"Superb but a little opulent","My husband and I had a super stay at this lovely hotel everything top notch, wonderful suites and service extremely good,only slight negative is it feels very formal and is not the place for a 'relaxing' holiday.","5","2012-12"
"This is not a hotel- it is a Palace","Our one day stay in this hotel was an epoch-making event in our travel life. The service is just great . Each room has a dedicated butler. The food is remarkable. the views are outstanding. I believe  many visitors from overseas can opt for helicopter or rolls-royce transfers from the airport. We in dubai just drove upto the hotel . Our VIP guests from mumbai were also with us. This hotel has some really VIP guests. many royalty. 
The fish tunnel is a terrific experience. The duplex suites have to be seen.","5",
"'The burj al arab'","It feels good to even say the above title.

Firstly can i state how unfair it is for people to be reviewing an afternoon brunch here! Im sure you can do this under the restaurants section. You are judging the hotel and havent stayed (unless you give it 5 thwn thats ok ha). 
Seriously but. Book a stay its worth every penny and more 

With my stay here i brought a lot of 'baggage' to the burj al arab, i wanted to propose to my girlfriend. No such problem for 'the burj' they threw suggestion my way arranged lots of wee extras and everything went exactly the way i wanted. 

I do admit i was reluctant to leave the zabeel saray for a surprise two night stay in 'the burj' but from the moment the rolls royce phantom picked us up outside the zabeel i never gave it a second thought. The wee driver being offering us cold towels and water with a selection of music before i had a chance to take in what was happening and about to happen. 

He call ahead of security to have the gates open and we are taken through the gates with the flashing of lights .....camera lights. Now the calmness of the bridge as we look up at the massive structure the driver has a cheek to ask if everything is ok and if we enjoyed his driving...... Em...... Yeah.....

We are greeted at the front door with a big man whom made me look like a wee boy.  To be then greeted with i think janine and 4 other ladys offering things to which i cannot mind,i think my mind was racing at this point.  Looking around the place is breath taking. The room even better the views and the intro to out butler was a nice stage. She was lovely person. Unfortunately they changes the nxt day tho and we never seen her again. So much more i want to say but i feel im rambling now. Everything in the hotel is perfect. All the staff seemed to get my 'laddish' humour and even gave some back absolutely brilliant. Francios ** showed us to the 'full' sky bar and squeezed us a seat. I think this was a wee touch because we were residents and we loved it.The pool i initially thought was poor but i was wrong. It adds to the prestige. We would use the jumeirah beach hotels exec pool in the morning and the go to burj late afternoon and watch that sunset. We wanted to just sit in the same spot for a life time

Anyway thanks burj al arab till next time","5","2013-09"
"The Burj, A Reputation Well Deserved","Nothing negative to say at all, quite the opposite. This hotel's immaculate reputation is well earned with every aspect of our stay as we would expect, and more from a hotel of this calibre. Too many positives to mention, a breathtaking property positioned in an enviable location with views and staff to match. Thank you to all at the Burj Al Arab for making us feel welcome and for making our stay a memorable one, we will be back.

Special mention to the Ukraine doormen who welcomed my husband with a huge hug, this astounded him and he is still telling everyone about it. It's the little things that mean the most, and they cost the least to give.....","5","2013-10"
"Happiness is the Burj","You have to visit this hotel for sure. We have now stayed a number of times and cannot find anywhere to match it....We are working people who save to come here and keep coming back as are made to feel special by all the staff at this stunning hotel. Nimal has the patience of a saint dealing with my emails each trip. Our room is always kept tip top by the housekeeping staff. Treat yourself to a relaxing spa treatment with views to die for. Food can be found in several restaurants and our favourite is the buffet in Al Iwan with chef Mohammed at the helm as always. The beach area is private for guests and Satish and his team are always on hand to help.Treat yourself once and you will never forget .....","5","2013-08"
"Burj Al Arab general review","Dear readers,

A few times i have been visiting this amazing piece of architect internal as well as external.
I am one of the lucky who was able to stay here overnight a couple of times and had various business dinners in the various restaurants the Burj has to offer and enjoyed many drinks in the Sky view bar which is on the top floor and provides an amazing view over the Dubai Skyline.

the Burj:

First of all its not easy to get in, and the best way to get in is to let a Jumeirah Group connected hotel make a reservation for you.
Some hotels in Deira and further from the Jumeirah area which are below 5 stars won’t be able to get you a reservation there especially not if it’s just for drink.

The Burj al Arab is a 6+1 star (7 Star is a misunderstanding and doesn't exist) hotel build in front of the Jumeirah beach line and connected to the mainland with a bridge.
At first you will find a checkpoint where they will check your purpose/reservation before letting you cross the bridge where you'll find the entrance and can view a huge array of super-cars usually parked out front from guests or owned by hotel to drive the guests around like the white Rolls & Royce Phantoms.

Once you entered you're again welcomed by a staff member to check your purpose and so on before walking through again.
The service standard of this hotel is very, very high and this will come back more in the different sections of this review.

The first thing that will strike you is the colorful water ballet and giant stairs with huge aquariums on either side with amazing fish assorted.
Reaching the general area on top huge gold plated pillars will strike you and another water ballet with in the middle a water fountain that will shoots as high as 500 feet.
From here you can reach the rooms, restaurants, shopping Centre and so on.

Restaurants:

There are 9 signature restaurants and all worth trying.
In here its about more then food and all giving you a different culinary experience.
One amazing restaurant is the seafood restaurant called Al Mahara supponsingly located underwater which you can reach by stairs or submarine.
In reality the restaurant is located in the parking lot and the submarine is a simulator.
Its a cool experience though and worth the extra effort, don't forget its fun for kids as well.
The Al Muntaha located up in the Skieview and Culinary Flight.
All of these are highly recommended but behold a night here can set you back a couple of hundreds if not thousands so beware.

Rooms:

Obviously there is a price tag on a night in the Burj al Arab.
Expect a couple of thousand but what you get is a 2 floor suite.
Everything in the room can be controlled from a remote with touchscreen display.
Any questions? Any requests? don't hesitate to tick the butler button and instruct one of the 2 butlers available at each floor, packing or unpacking the luggage is small favor.

What to take:

* Platina Card (If going to Dinner, Overnight or Drinks at the Skyview)
* Photocamera","5",
"Wow!","Had a 6 night stay last year and had to go back.  Second stay was for 13 nights and what a stay!  In short it is everything people say it is, rooms are fantastic, food is superb (Junsui is fabulous and the service is second to none), if they haven't got what you want just ask and they will get it for you.

If you have a bucket list this hotel has to be on it and a must do...we will return later this year or early next.","5","2012-11"
"Luxury & Fun in Dubai","What an experience it was to stay at the Burj Al Arab.  The staff were excellent - efficient but friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them.
Our room, or should I say apartment, was amazing with living areas downstairs & bedroom/retreat upstairs.  It was the height of luxury & comfort.  The bathroom was very decadent with a spa & an enormous shower.
We booked the Culinary Flight so we could experience all their restaurants & this exceeded our very high expectations.
Would highly recommend a stay here for those who like a bit of fun with luxury.","5","2013-06"
"Not worth the money","We were expecting more attention to details and a truly unique experience. While we did have a good time, I’d like to point out the following aspects, which myself and my wife were very disappointed by:
1.	Attention to details – it is the small things that make a difference. When we checked in, we were asked whether we are allergic to anything. We said yes, since I am allergic to cocoa and chocolate. We were celebrating my 30th birthday and we went to dinner to Al Mahara. At the end of the dinner, the staff brought a birthday cake. It was a chocolate cake…Nice gesture but for a hotel that claims to be the most luxurious in the world, we would have expected that since we said my wife is allergic to chocolate, you keep that in your file. Why would they ask if you they don't care anyway?

2.	Reservations for dinner – guest preferences and priority for in-house guests.
a.	Sky View Bar. We wanted to go have a drink in the Sky Bar at 7 o’clock – we were told it’s fully booked. We are aware that the hotel sells separate packages to anyone who wants to go, as long as they commit to a minimum consumption. We assume it was fully booked because of that. We were disappointed though, we would have thought that a hotel of this caliber keeps a number of seats available for in-house guests. I guess our expectations were too high, since the Sky View bar apparently didn’t have space for 2. We ended up making a reservation for after dinner, at 10:30 PM but we asked to please have a table by the window. Again, we would have expected that a hotel like the Burj al Arab actually cares when the guest says they’d prefer a certain table – we were wrong, we were seated in the middle of the bar, with a view towards the bartender! And there were tables available by the window. We asked to be seated to one, we were not, we decided to leave and the manager came and finally offered a table by the window. This should have been a great service, great experience but it is not remembered as such unfortunately.
b.	Al Mahara. We made our reservation for dinner for 8:30 PM. When we made the reservation, we specifically asked for a table by the aquarium. We got there and were not seated at a table by the aquarium, even though there were tables available. Again, why does the staff ask the guests for their preferences if nobody cares in the end? I expected a hotel like the Burj to pay attention to these details. We spoke with the hostess and she moved us to a table by the aquarium – it would have been nice if our restaurant arrival experience had been different though.

3.	Speed of service for IT issues in the room. Our TV system froze and we couldn’t do anything anymore. We called the butler for assistance. We thought that it should not take long. Almost 20 minutes later, we called to follow up, since nobody came. Eventually someone came after 30 minutes. We found that quite annoying and unacceptable. To have to wait 30 minutes for someone to show up and restart the system?

4.	Room IT equipment. It is quite a contrast when you look at the room décor and how those old and cheap plastic telephones don’t fit in! They should really upgrade their IT equipment, including the control devices. All could be controlled with an iPad nowadays and the telephones can look really stylish and classy. Also, when the phones ring, it is like the entire suite is ringing. I understand they want to make it easier for the guests but the volume and the ring tones need to be looked into, it could be something less loud and more classy, rather than a really ugly tone that could wake up the entire floor.

5.	Room card deactivation – again attention to details and connecting the dots. We asked for a late checkout and it was provided, for 2 PM. We were in the hotel at 12 PM on Saturday and wanted to go back to our room, shower, relax and then check out. Surprise: our cards were not working anymore. It was embarrassing to have to wait for other guests to arrive so that we can use their cards to get to our floor. My point is: if you approve guest checkout late, make sure their cards work until checkout time and avoid embarrassing situations for your guests.

We submitted this review to the hotel and they responded that they will take this into account and ensure other guests don't experience this. For those of you curios to stay in the Burj, it's really not worth it. Jumeirah has other beautiful resorts (Madinat Jumeirah next door, for instance) so don't waste your time and money by staying at the Burj.","3","2013-09"
"Absolute Decadence","We have stayed here twice and enjoyed the spectacle. Great if somewhat overdone service, and a good selection of restaurants. The rooms are opulent to say he least. Worth one visit. Try the Japanese in particular. View from the top is a must ","4","2012-11"

"Burj-Al-Arab....best hotel to stay in","I visited Dubai with my family for Dubai Shopping Festival and decided to stay at Burj-Al-Arab. My family and I were keen to enjoy a week there and we were not disappointed with our decision. The services are superb . The staff is very helping and supportive and makes you feel that you are indeed in the hands of experts in pleasing the customer. 
Butlers in this hotel never tire to work to make one's stay memorable booking restaurants, spas and offering advice on everything even checking the weather upon arrival to one's next destination! Complimentary trasportation to and from the beach is a big plus although the location of the new swimming pool is within walking distance from the entrance of the hotel and the ride by boat to and from the Souk nearby is also free. 
It is worth paying a visit to the Souk after an evening meal as it remains open until very late at night. The spa is serene and the service exceptional. The Reception team is efficient and very friendly and the housekeeping works very hard to keep the standard of cleanliness to meet even the highest of expectations. 
THANK YOU chaps and needless to say we shall be back next year!","5","2012-11"
"Returning to the Burj Al Arab","Another year, another birthday and yes we chose to return to the Burj.  My family and I were keen to enjoy a week there to celebrate the event and we were not disappointed with our decision.  In fact, the support we received from Mr. Ahmed Ereiba, Lana Gulina and Richard Svensson when a few problems arose re our accommodation was superb, reminding us that we were indeed in the hands of experts in pleasing the customer.

Next, I must not neglect to mention the butler band: Albin, Vasim, Vinu, Firoz, Earl, Harish, Feroz and Paulo who touched us all so deeply with their genuine desire to anticipate our every wish.  Butlers in this hotel never tire to work to make one's stay memorable booking restaurants, spas and offering advice on everything even checking the weather upon arrival to one's next destination!

"Out of this world","This hotel was amazing, the rooms were spotless and so big.  We stayed there for just one night on a stop over from Hong Kong.

Even though check in was later in the day we landed at about 4.30am and went directly to the hotel where we were able to check in straight away.  The staff were brilliant and couldn't do enough for you.

The beach is beautiful and the golf buggy ride to the beach was a nice touch.  Also there is wild waddi water park attached to the hotel which is great fun and free with the hotel where the snacks were also very reasonably priced.

The room and the beds were so comfy, with feather mattress topper on the bed.

Would definitely stay again.","5","2012-10"

"Special hotel for special occasion","Just returned from a five day stay at the Burj to celebrate our Pearl Wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble. The first surprise was an upgrade to a panoramic suite which was superb, following issues with the room we were then moved to a club suite, wow what a room. The butlers were always attentive and majority of times they let you in your room rather than use your own key. We pre booked all our meals before we left UK which took the stress out of thinking what you would need that evening, most restaurants were not full but a times they were busy, so doing this ensured we always had a table at the time we required. There are a loot of day tourists to the hotel which at times does spoil the experience for the guests as you have to adhere to the dress code in the main areas, when on a holiday this sometimes became tiresome. As the beach is across the causeway and really only accessible by buggy we stayed around the pool, which was very pleasant when it was quiet but not so when unaccompanied children seemed intent on running riot in the pool. We took the afternoon tea package which was extremely nice, the position of our table was exceptional, unfortunately we could not fully enjoy as other diners were constantly attempting to climb over us to get photographs of the views, personal space was not respected by other guests such a shame the staff seemed unable to stop this and the layout should be reviewed. On our actual day we took the culinary experience which I must say is worth while, every restaurant was trying to outdo the other which made for an exceptional evening. The places are very limited so if you get the chance book this evenings dinner. Overall I would say this is a hotel to experience once in your life and make sure you go for a special occasion as the prices are not cheap and the standards expected within do make this less relaxing than a beach holiday destination.","5","2013-09"
"Spoil Me","Stayed for a couple of nights and boy I feel ""like a boss"". Spoiled and pampered, I just wanted to scream in ecstasy. Food was exceptional and there's a lot of choices. The amenities... well like my title, will get you spoiled.. :)

"Jewel of Dubia","From the chauffeur drive pick up from the airport to the personal greeting and check-in on arrival, it is a world apart, luxury at its best. Visually stunning both inside and out, you will find it difficult to do any sight seeing besides the hotel itself. Take the time to visit the spa and the indoor pool up high with great views whilst you swim. The more energetic can enjoy a game of squash to work up an appetite in the incredible restaurants. The suites which are all two story with a sweeping staircase are very well appointed all with butler service and no request is a problem for the staff. This iconic hotel is in a class of its own and should be on everyone's to do list.","5","2012-10"
"Astonishing","In a standard room of 170m2 life is really wonderful. But more than that I enzoyed the private zacuzzi which was prepared for me exactly at the time I wished! Music, flowers, everything. Excellent service, amazing view. A little overdecorated and far away from European standards of elegant hotels, it was an interesting experience.The under water restaurant which is not really under water but only surrounded of aquariums was not ideal for me! The bar on the top floor had excellent view but a little oldish atmosphere.","5","2012-10"

"More than 7 star experience","I stayed here for one night in a stardard suite. It was the most amazing experience of my life.
At checkin you are given hand towels and dates to nibble on. They then show you around the hotel and escort you to your suite while you check in inside your suite.

The rooms were the biggest standard rooms I have ever seen- 2 storeys with breathtaking views. It was like a large townhouse. There was a MAC computer, everything was remote controlled and we had 2 butlers at our service 24 hrs.

Our guest services agent/ butler was Kieran- we was very very helpful and professional. Kieran helped us book an amazing tour of the dessert. He was patient and very accomodating! thank you for your outstanding service Kieran!!

We were also delighted with free 4pm checkout because we had a midnight flight.

There was one short fall- we did not like the fact that the hotel was manned. The gate was not very welcoming and it was inferior as if you are locked out or in of an institution. Instead of putting a security guard to man the gate perhaps they could put someone in a suit with guest services experience.

Apart from that I will be back soon","5","2013-06"
"Simply Amazing","Having just returned from our 2 night stay at this amazing hotel i have nothing but praise for this quality and amazing hotel. From the minute we arrived we were treated like royalty and the hotel itself is breath taking from the lobby to the rooms and the staff could not do enough for you.
I can go on and on but but i wont.......lol....thankyou very much Burj Al Arab missing you already","5","2013-08"
"Treated like a VIP.","From the time you arrive at the security check point and they call ahead to reception your journey begins.  You are greeted by you personal assistant for the time that you are here. We stayed in the panoramic suite. And omg. The room was in believable . You get a butler on call 24/7. The prices are a bit steep but that is what you get at a 7 star hotel. The bed are soft and comfortable. The bathrooms full of colourful tiles and gold fittings. (I am glad I don't have to clean the bathroom it would take forever lol) 
Know I now what it must be like to be a rockstar/royalty or celebrity that is the way the staff treat you. 
Overall cant rate this hotel highly enough.","5","2013-08"
"Impressive","Stayed here in May 2013 for three days on a return transit from Europe  with a friend/work colleague. 

Certainly for WOW factor this would be hard to beat. The service was extremely personal to the point of being annoying at the end in some parts! The rooms are quite incredible to see, we had a two bedroom suite that was in effect a two level apartment with dining room, sitting room etc- incredible but gaudy, I suppose that's the Arabic taste though. 

Not dissimilar to other premier hotels where a certain level of dress is expected I suppose but walking down from room in board shorts and a t-shirt and runners to go to the beach attracted quite a few looks of horror and was a little disconcerting to be honest.. How else do you dress to go to the beach?  

The spa is incredible and definitely worth visiting for a massage/treatment.

All in all it was an experience and one I would like to do one more time with my partner instead of a mate next time as it definitely is amazing but at $2K AUD or round about per night (for the two bed suite) it would want to be fairly impressive too.","4","2013-05"
"An experience worth doing!!!","We booked for two nights at the end of our honeymoon and the hotel is amazing - the wow factor is definitely had when you walk in and find out you have a suite room with TWO floors, panoramic windows, a Jacuzzi in the bathroom and his and hers toiletries! The restaurants are pretentious with very small portions, but if you like that sort of thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. The only real disappointment was breakfast - for a seven star hotel you would expect something a little bit special, and to be honest, it was no different than any other hotel - buffet self service with everything going cold and very little staff. 
Definitely worth a visit - the beaches, the hotel, the pool, the service - everything is spot on and makes you feel like a celeb!!","4","2013-05"
"Heaven","Best hotel I have ever stayed in FABULOUS. Went for my birthday and we had the time of our lives. I'm saving already to go again. I must say the hotel is out of this world we had our own butler and he did everything to make sure we enjoyed our selfs, couldn't find any fault","5","2012-10"
"Stunning .","This is a beautiful hotel , restaurants and If unable to go in ...can be very pricey and long booking list . It is a must to just go and view a splendid sight .","5",
"Dining at the Burj Al Arab","Reservations are compulsary to get past the landward entrance. The decor bothinside and out is iconic. The 'brunches' are the cheapest/best vaue option but still very expensive. However if in Dubai it is a must","5",
"Not seven stars but 10 stars!","This is truly the best hotel in the world. We were a little apprehensive about staying here but it was a wonderful experience. The hotel itself is gorgeous and classy and not tacky as we expected. The Rolls Royce transfer was special especially for the kids. The Burj al Arab experience is special due to the impeccable personal service it provides throughout the hotel. The personal butler service is fantastic who organise your whole holiday and make everything really easy and are a good source of information. On the Sixteenth floor Sam our daytime butler was superb and we can't thank him enough. The private dining facility is faultless and good value compare to other 5 star hotels. The pool on the 18th floor is beautiful with spectacular views. The views throughout the hotel were amazing. The buggy service to get you around the souk and private beach was excellent. All in all a stay at the Burj was worth every single penny and in fact I would say it is very good value. I will be visiting again.","5","2013-08"
"Fabulous","Is a beautiful hotel to spend some time in ! The decor is gorgeous and the rooms were tastefully decorated. The buffet is one of the best ones around!  The staff was friendly, efficient, and professional.","5",
"Excellent","I spent 3 nights here whilst on my Honeymoon in june 2013. By far the best hotel i have stayed in. The staff go out their way to treat you 7 star and make your stay special, and no request is too much. Our personal butler was very helpful and courtious at all times. Yes its very expensive to stay, however its worth the money. It is a stay definatley worth experiencing. ","5","2013-06"
"Wow!","This place is for sure worth  its 7stars rank. We were picked up at the airport by them, waiting for luggage in comfortable lounge, then assisted to passport control. Once passing the border another team took us over and led to the parking where white RR was waiting. In the hotel everything and everyone is 100% consumer oriented, polite, helpful, quick, discret...everything one could expect from such place. Swimming pool at the top floor and the one at the bottom are masterpieces - must try - each time you come back from swimming they offer sunglasses cleaning for your comfort!:-), go and try also their beach - 3 minutes from hotel, transportation at demand not waiting even 5 minutes. Variety and quality of food is excellent. We had really a great time there. Perfect for special anniversary!
Ps.the only thing they lag behind is wifi coverage but...who would badder browsing in such a place:-)","5","2013-08"
"Extraordinary place, amazing service","This hotel really is quite out of this world. Stunning décor and service at a level that I have never before experienced. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they even provided a cake and flowers upon hearing of my birthday! Everything, down to the last detail was perfect. Put it on your bucket list, there is not another hotel like it","5","2013-08"
"birthday stay at the burj al arab","We booked the burj for 3 nights  as part of a 6 night stay in dubai for my birthday.one of my main concerns before arriving was the dress code within the hotel.- on arrival on being escorted to the room, we were passed by 4 young men dressed in shorts flip flops etc so I think that answered my concerns
The room was amazing over 2 floors. We had been put on the 22nd floor and were looked after fantasticaly well by butlers heidi and anup.nothing was too much trouble for them.on the evening of my birthday a cake was delivered to the room and the butlers all came in to sing happy birthday-one even playing a guitar! 
The thing that struck me especially was the staff.all seemed to want to go the extra mile-they all seem to know your name.
Only disapointment was the breakfast- we have  stayed in most of the hotels in dubai and most of them offered a better breakfast choice than the burj -we tried both options in junsui and babs al yam and neither really offered the choice I would expect from ahotel of this standard
Apart from that if you get the chance to go just do it!
Well done and thank you burj al arab!

"Chance of a lifetime","Stayed 5 nights here , absolutely worth it's 7 star rating. The private beach and the staff were wonderful. Especially liked the pressie' s on the bed  every night. Felt a million dollars all the time I was there .","5","2012-10"
"Stunning!","I thought that this hotel was out of this world!!! It was my brothers birthday so we had our own private tour of the hotel witch was amazing. The food was exquisite and the accommodation was heavenly. Real top notch. :)","5","2012-09"
"one in a million","from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave this hotel will just astound you, it is everything you want in a hotel and more, no wonder this is the only 7star hotel in the world. 
The views, the attention to detail, your personal butler, the food, the list just goes on and on.
until something else comes along to beat the Burj, this is the only place to go!!!!!!","5","2013-07"
"Skip the inside, but hang out at the beach to get magnificent views of the hotel","From the outside this hotel is a sight to see and architecturally a phenomenon both in terms of engineering and aesthetics.  It's visible quite afar and the best views are from the beach. I was quite impressed by this structure and as tourist attraction visiting is a must for Dubai.  Unfortunately, this was the apex of my experience at the Burj Al Arab.

As soon as you drive up to the hotels things change.  The Alladinesque and cartoonish uniforms the porters and staff wear give you a clue of what you'll find inside. My initial impressions of the lobby and entrance hall can only be described as garish and over the top.  Other parts of the hotel can be described as tacky, gaudy, and generally in bad taste.  Also, the lobby seemed to be stuffed with Chinese tourists taking pictures with the cheesy dancing fountain.  This hotel is trying too hard and overshoots in terms of trying to be luxurious and plush.  In the end you feel like you're in a Disneyland attraction, rather than a supposed seven star hotel.

The Burj Al Arab is a bit of a paradox - from the outside it's elegant and an attraction in itself.  Inside, it is an exemplar of bad taste and unadulterated tackiness.

There are numerous other hotels in Dubai that are much more elegant: Grosvernor House, Kempinski and Fairmont to name a few.","3","2013-08"
"Dubai Staycation","As Dubai residents we have a great range of hotels. Having visited the Burj Al Arab on several occassions for dinner & drinks, we opted for a weekend stay. The Suite & Butler service was superb. The staff are excellent and made the stay so enjoyable.","5","2013-08"
"Honeymoon Heaven....","Amazing out of this world place. A must before you take your last breath on this earth!
Had our own butler Nagesh. Lovely man who would do anything for us.
The spa is stunning. So quiet we were the only 2 in there at one point of our stay. The restaurant at the top is fabulous too. 7 courses, intricate cuisine & long island ice tea's... WOW.....
Breakfast in incredible too. Never before have i had or seen mini fillet steaks for breakfast.","5","2013-03"
"Amazing","We have just returned from a our stay at the Burj, I last stayed 12 years ago when I lived in Dubai and it has got even better! From the moment you arrive the service is  very personal and you feel like a VIP your whole stay, you check-in in your suite, (all suites in the the burj are duplex) we had wine,fruit, Arabian sweets in our room and all were replenished during our stay. The bathrooms are huge with jacuzzi bath full size his and hers Hermes toiletries. It seemed each time we left the room someone went in and tidied around replenished things - this was during Eid and the hotel was busy at this time. We had breakfast in Bab al Yam (near the pool) which offered everything cereal, fruit, cooked etc, so we were very pleased with what was on offer.  The pool is just the perfect temperature, and the service around the pool was excellent your own coolbox with ice cold towels was always being replenished.  My only point is that the hotel is so amazing inside I've always felt that the outside is just a bit ordinary visually but service is the best.  I've eaten in a few of the restaurants previously and they were good but the standard of dining at any hotel in Dubai is very high, Jumeirah beach do a very good buffet and you can get a buggy from the burj across to the Jumeirah beach hotel. The spa is lovely very quiet when I used it pool overlooks Dubai,  The bar on the (23rd floor I think) is worth a visit a unique experience in Dubai and a great view of the shoreline both day and night.  Like many others have said from the moment you arrive it makes for a fabulous stay, the perfect place for a special celebration and memories that will last forever. Although 7star it has a lovely relaxed feel not stuffy in any way, children are made very welcome too. It is a very expensive place to stay but we thought it was worth every penny for the level of attention, service, the standard of the rooms and I could go on and on.   The location is perfect as anywhere around jumeirah is, dubai has grown hugely in the last 10years and everything is in this area now, shopping malls, hotels, marina, the palm so its a great place to be. We will return again and hopefully soon!!!","5","2013-08"
"Awe-inspiring","It was my wife's birthday in Dec 2012, and I thought of treating her in a special way. Burj made this happen seamlessly while I was at work. From a spotless S-500, to a luxuriant 5 hours at spa, taking care of all possible details, to a splendid dinner at Al-Muntaha, followed by a special birthday cake, it was just too good to be true. I'm glad that I selected Burj to tell my wife how special she is for me.","5","2012-12"
"Fabulous again","This was our second stay at the Burj al Arab. On this occasion, it happened to be our daughter's 11th birthday on the day we arrived. The staff at the Burj were fantastic...they serenaded her, presented her with a cake, bouquet of flowers and birthday gift, and all day long they wished her Happy Birthday whenever they say her. The efforts that the staff made to make her birthday special were exceptional.
On our last evening, we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. At dinner, we were given a table on the beach, given complimentary champagne, serenaded, and presented with flowers and a complimentary photograph of the evening. 
The staff at the Burj go out of their way to make every moment of your stay perfect. From the moment that you arrive you are treated like royalty, like unpacking your luggage when you arrive and packing it again for you when you leave! Nothing is too much trouble.
A truly memorable stay!","5","2013-04"
"Fading Glory","Stayed in this hotel 7 years ago and although I paid around US$2,000 for a night for a standard room then, I considered it every penny’s worth. Lately when I saw a good deal by a tour offering two-night stay at the Burj, I immediately joined as I wanted to show my mom this beautiful hotel as other family members have stayed there already. Unfortunately, the experience this time showed fading glory of the hotel.

Shortly upon arrival, our tour of 22 guests was told we could not stay in the lobby (as most were busy taking pictures) and we were being led to an empty suite. As our group was from Hong Kong, a butler from China was being arranged to give us briefing in Mandarin. As he spoke really fast and there were so many things to remember (how to operate the various systems by remote controls, what types of souvenirs were complimentary and what not etc.), our group found it difficult to follow and got bored very soon. After we voiced out feedback that we could not understand what he was saying, the butler looked a bit annoyed but repeated everything again. The hotel just assumed we all understood Mandarin instead of English but that might not be the case. As our guide was not staying in this expensive hotel, he could not go beyond the lobby floor and could not do the translation for those guests who could not understand the butler. This arrangement disappointed some guests within our group because if we had checked in individually, a butler would be showing us the room and briefing us personally (in our preferred language), unlike the lecture-like experience we had. Besides seeing many butlers who were on duty being Indians, we learned that as many as probably 5 tours were checking in almost the same time. That might be the reason for the lecture arrangement but this already tarnished the first impression of the hotel for some guests. Due to Ramadan, we noticed the floor mosaic was being maintained on the lobby floor.

As our room this time was a standard twin room, the size was only half the size of my previous 2-bedroom suite (being upgraded from standard room) as there was no dining room or a kitchen. Nevertheless, every inch of the room (especially the mosaic in the bathroom) was well maintained and clean. I noticed the key holder was a simple name card holder, unlike the previous key which had a small torch. The complimentary slippers were also downgraded to just ordinary slippers like any other hotels. The toileteries remained being supplied by Hermes and other complimentary items like beach bags, bottle of red wine, mineral water and a box of candies remained unchanged. The Apple computer in the room was unchanged but when I called the butler desk saying I needed some training for the use of the computer, I had to wait for 30 minutes before a Mandarin speaking butler showed up. Guess it was the language consideration which caused my long wait. 

Nevertheless, there were still positive experiences during the 2-night stay this time. The afternoon snacks were excellent and all staff tried their best to make our stay pleasant. Due to lack of bath mat in the shower, my mom stood on a towel while taking shower to prevent slippery. The towel happened to block the drains and flooded half of the bathroom. Housekeeping immediately came to rescue and the Nepalese lady by the name of Kumari cleaned up the mess very efficiently with a smile and assured us it was not a problem at all. On the last morning of our stay, the hotel offered guests a free tour of the famous Al Mahara (the aquarium) and Al Muntaha (the top) Restaurants. The butler by the name of Hazel who provided the guided tour could speak Cantonese which was very welcomed by our group. Unfortunately due to the heat and haze, we could not see either The Palm or the World from Al Muntaha Restaurant.

Had breakfast in both the Junsui (Far East Asian cuisine) as well as the Bab Al Yam (pool side) Restaurant. Selection of food in Junsui was abundant but it was very busy as several tours came to enjoy breakfast there as a cheaper option to visit the hotel. On the contrary, the pool side restaurant was almost empty as the selection of food might just be 10% of what Junsui offered but the staff there offered excellent services. This restaurant also had fresh honey comb which the Junsui did not have. As breakfast at both restaurants cost the same, the pool side restaurant did not offer value for money comparatively speaking. Also had lunch buffet at Al Iwan Restaurant on the lobby floor. It was rather disappointing because selection of food was not enough and other than appetizers and deserts, majority of the food was local/Middle Eastern dishes. We ended up eating crab legs and prawns to fill up our stomach as there were no other western dishes. I vaguely remember this restaurant offered caviar seven years ago when we ate there. Think it was all about cost cutting as room rates could not be raised too much given competition from newer luxurious hotels and the hotel were accepting more tours’ reservation than before.","4","2013-07"
"One and only Burj Al Arab","This was our 4th stay at this hotel and every time we stayed there it was nothing but a great experience. In our last stay we stayed in a two bed room deluxe suite and my daughters enjoyed their own room and a grand bathroom.

Everything about this hotel is perfect eventhough we had small complaint in our third stay. The management was very quick to resolve the issue and made us go back there again. A seven star hotel with a seven star service, kudos to the management.

I hope we will go to Dubai soon and will definitely chose to stay here again,

If you can afford it experience it and you won't forget the experience. 

I can go on writing about it but to say in one word LUXURY.","5","2012-09"
"Once in a lifetime, absolutely stunning.","I have visited this hotel many times and each time I love it more and more. 

Everywhere you look there is gold, glamour and impressive water features. 

Even just to go and look at the lobby ( which is enormous) is fantastic. 

The restaurant on the top floor is a must do, however please note they are really strict on clothing- make sure you are in trousers and ties gentlemen. 

Even if you just go in during visiting times, it is a great experience not to be missed. 

At night the helicopter pad lights up in various different colours and it is just stunning.","5",
"Best Hotel Ever","We stayed here for 2 nights for our Wedding Anniversary and it far exceeded our expectations.  Everything was perfect.  We were on the 19th floor in room 1902 and we had an amazing view of the Palm and Atlantis hotel.  The infinity indoor pool and jacuzzi were excellent with stunning views.  We ate in Bab Al Yam and it was a very good buffet with plenty of choice.  We also had afternoon tea and cocktails in the Sky View bar both of which were very enjoyable.  The staff were all very courteous and friendly.  Our room was just so perfect and the only complaint I have is that we didn't stay longer.","5","2013-07"
"Dream visit","Perfect stay at the perfect hotel. Had a panoramic room with the most attentive staff and service, unfortunately only for one night.","5",
"Got a dream birthday surprise in a one night stay here.","Thanks to my husband, we spent one night in the Burj..Have to confess the entire experience was a lil daunting at first..there was a butler on hand eager to assist us and the room was simply to die for. We stayed in the Delux ocean suite which had 180 degrees of ocean views..and overall the experience was lovely. I have stayed in hotels before but never have I experienced such eagerness to please the guests. Each person was willing to go out of their way to make our trip memorable and I thoroughly enjoyed. 

The one negative that I would say about this place is the lack of things to do within the hotel. The indoor pool is a lil claustrophobic and the outdoor pool is very small compared to the grandeur of other hotels. Also they have a massage parlour but at 750 dirhams for a one hour massage,..its a one time indulgence. I did not enjoy the restaurant. The food was too bland and exotic for my liking and I found myself missing the usual treats in a Chinese/Thai restaurants.

All in all it is an experience which one should have atleast once in their lives.. :)","4","2013-07"
"First Class Hotel","We recently stayed at the Burj and loved it.  Its Fancy Schamnzy!!! . Skip the Rolls Service to hotel from airport.  ( Windows are way to small to see out and look at the amazing Dubai skyline )

Watch the building of the burj before you go on (Discovery Channel "" building it "" ) and appreciate the architecture that went into building such a wonder.  The staff go out of there way to accommodate your every need and the rooms are Versace Sheik.  ( no Pun intended )  We found the people of Dubai to be very hospitable and friendly and would highly recommend you go.  Must see.... Burj Kalifa, Ski Dubai, Wadi Water Park, Auto Drome.  First class shopping.","5","2013-07"
"A Fine Weekend Break","From the airport pick up to the airport drop off our weekend visit to the hotel was seamless. The Al Mahara and Al Muntaha food was as good as expected and the staff were excellent and very friendly. The pool/pool bar staff were excellent and friendly as were the Skyview Bar crew. The floor concierge/butlers were brilliant - when asked they sorted things without fuss and welcomed us back to the suite often opening the door for us. We stay in excellent hotels around the world that may almost equal the Burj Al Arab, but I cannot think of one that betters it.","5","2013-07"
"Iconic hotel","Iconic 7-star hotel located on a purpose built island.  The external few is slick and attractive with a very rich internal colors and decor.  View from top restaurant is great, food is average","5",
"WORLD CLASS","The best hotel in the world, My with and two children went for one night for my wife's birthday.
It cost £1000 for the one night but it was worth every penny......................
The rooms were over two floors, they were fantastic..
You have your own butler for your stay at the hotel, My boy loved that!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where ever we go now nowhere in the world would beat this hotel.
AAAAA+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","5","2013-06"
"state of art & luxury !","right from the moment you enter the lobby, ur breath is taken by the creative design, i loved the fish filled walls, as if it is a palace in the bottom of the ocean. 
rooms take you to the colours paradise. furniture very classy. 
we had dinner at AL IWAN resturant. atmosphere was amazing.beautiful oriental interiors. food very good.service very professional and friendly.
spa is another story .... waw !","5","2013-07"
"That is worth the money","We had the opportunity to spend 4 nights there and we had a Panoramic ""One"" bedroom suite. The ""Room"" was gigantic, with combined view of Dubai Marina and the Gulf. We certainly recommend the extra compared to the ""standard"" suites. We enjoyed our stay and we can only commend all the staff for their attentiveness and kindness, even with two young kids who unfortunately do not always behave...","5","2013-06"
"What a treat","We have visited this hotel twice now! First a 2 week holiday and just a 2 night stay.
We always have a 2 bedroomed suite as travel as a family and have always found them to be spotless and all the staff very friendly and helpful. After only 2 nights they always greeted us by name and a pleasant welcome. The food is second to none at breakfast, lunch and dinner. It truly is a treat to stay at this hotel and hope that one day we will be able to return again.","5","2012-08"
"7 star hotel u must be kidding","i have been to lot of hotels, and i had lot of expectations in burj al arab, when i entered every thing look good and felt good but the service was pathetic, no one even bothered to say hi, hello and even at the time of breakfast i asked for tea they served me coffee, and i asked them to change it they looked at me like a pest and the tone of the service personal was like he will kill me right now, if you say that is 7 star.....uff","2","2012-10"
"Kings for the day","Stayed for a week in Dubai and one night at the Burj Al Arab. On arrival we were treated like Royalty, handed scented towels and dates by lovely ladies and were taking to our one bedroom suite by the conceirge. The suite, which was on two floors came with our own personal butler. Our room was enormous, decorated in oppulent gold and blue. The lounge and dining area downstairs had huge sofa's, an enormous TV and was very grand. There was a sweeping  staircase to our bedroom, which had marvellous views of the harbour once the electric curtains were open. Our bathroom was magnificant with marble floors a jacuzzi and lovely Hermes toiletries.
We took advantage of the gym, which was well equiped and the spa, which was very relaxing, again with amazing views from the pool.
Afternoon tea with the accompanyment of a harp was a lovely experience.
Our evening meal at the Al Iwan was superb, with marvellous Arabic flavours, served by multple waiters and assistants. Again breakfast the next morning had so many wonderfull options to chose from
Our stay at The Burj was pure luxury from start to finish and the friendly and couteous staff added to the experience","5","2013-04"
"Absolutely gorgeous if a little bling","Just the most beautiful hotel, great service served with a smile . Our 2 bedroom suite was enormous and supreme confortable with great views. It was very shiny and gold and bling and I felt a little like I had stepped inside Tutankhamen's face mask. fabulos though","5","2013-05"
"SUPERB!!!!","I cannot add wonderful words about this precious hotel, its suites and restaurants everybody else already mentioned! But I would like to underline the marvellous ASSAWAN SPA!!!!! The swimming pool is dream like. The massage experience I got from EGSIN (the massage therapist) was excellent, never got one even close to it before. Very good job!!! The management chose the best staff. Thank you","5","2013-07"
"Excellent stay","Wow!  Have visited.........and now we have stayed and want to stay again and again.  We stayed here in June in a panoramic suite on floor 11 the views are fantastic, the suite out of this world with a sweeping staircase up to the bedroom - but what makes this hotel so special are the the staff they are happy, professional, well groomed and so well trained, and yet still able to have a laugh and a joke.

The hotel is of course spotless, the food service and the facilities next to none.  There are no faults with this hotel, just lots of happy memories.

Floor butlers and room butlers are amazing, well done Basma and your colleagues,we look forward to seeing  you next year.","5","2013-06"
"Overrated Icon","Its over priced, service is pathetic and all that it has to offer is the iconic building. Have stayed here several times and used the restaurants and bars for business. But, there are far better hotels in Dubai that do everything better. Opulent Suites with mirrors on the ceiling. I could hardly sleep over there. If you've had a few drinks its difficult to negotiate back to the room primarily because of the open atrium. I avoid this hotel like the pest. Decor is too confusing but the exterior is great. If you are not living there beware that there is a charge to cross the bridge!","2",
"Luxury and Glamour","We stayed 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite with our 16 year old son.  The suite was truely enormous and had everything you could desire, including the butler of course!  There are golf buggies to take you everywhere (the waterpark - which was excellent; the beach and other restaurants) but you may want to be dropped back at the pool entrance rather than the front door if you are in beach wear as you may feel rather inappropriately dressed otherwise.  We used the spa and had a good massage - there are seperate saunas and steam rooms for men and women (nothing special) - but women can use the mens pool in addition to their own - and the infinity pool has spectacular architecture and views.    The best bit for us was the beach - you even get a cool box delivered to your sun lounger - such luxury!
The let down was the restaurant booking - if you want to eat inside anywhere you need to book early which we were never told, so spent 3 evenings waiting around while our butler tried to get us into places.  We did eat in the 27th floor restaurant in the hotel - great food and views, but very expensive.    People who stay here are also very smartly dressed even if they are in casual wear at breakfast - you can go sleeveless, but may not want to and no women wear shorts in this hotel.","4","2013-07"
"Iconic place to stay in Dubai","Perhaps because I had such high expectations of this hotel due the wonderful marketing I was slightly let down. Yes the architecture brilliant, yes the rooms luxurious and expansive, but I felt the reception service was not impeccable and this was our first impression. Felt a bit theme-parky when inside. The personal butler staff were great and food was good. The breakfast area seems quite common - its certainly needs some kind of a makeover.  I had a couple of specific complaints but as they were addressed very well I don't need to elaborate. The fact that issues were addressed, leaves me ultimately with a good impression.","3","2013-04"
"BETTER THAN THE LAST TIME","The Burj Al Arab is a magnificent hotel, I have been there many times for many reasons and it is better every time, the staff are lovely, everyone is smiling and the views are fantastic and the food is sumptuous and tasty! 5/5","5","2013-05"
"Perfect place to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary","We loved this hotel immensely! Stayed 3 nights! From the luxurious decor in the suite - to the helpful butler ... It was an experience we will always treasure.  The meals were amazing and we particularly liked our swim on the private beach - with baby sting ray and fish.  The water was gorgeous and we had such great service from the life guards on the beach.  They supplied us with an Eski full of iced water and fresh towels.  How could we forget meeting 'George' the huge fish in the restaurant ? He was gorgeous and worth travelling so far to see.","5","2013-07"
"Over the top and utterly fantastic","I love everything about the Burj Al Arab. The two level rooms, the decor, the fish tanks beside the escalators, the majic of the whole place and the service is pretty good to.","5",
"Would not fail your expectation","Spent 2 nights at this ""most luxurious hotel in the world"", don't expect it to be the most contemporary hotel, the decor is somewhat classic than hip. The serivce indeed is top notch, you could speak to your butler and they would not fail your request. The bathroom amentites is something every female will fall in love with.","5","2013-05"
"Most amazing experience","We stayed here for our Honeymoon in May 2012.  It was smooth running from the moment we got off the plane.  We were met by staff whisked away by a chauffer, given flowers (at the airport).  They knew our names as soon as we stepped out of the car, given fresh cold towels, tea and coffee.  We were taken to our room to check in and then introduced to our personal butler.  We were given a tour of the hotel and facilities.
The staff were eager to assist with anything - including running a bath, candles and rose petals included along with a cake and bottle of champagne.
Every time we returned to the suite the butler would give us a ""surprise"" including personally embroidered towels to take home, and different gifts on our bed.
There were a number of celebrities staying whilst we were there and when we mentioned it to our butler he responded by saying ""we treat all our guests the same at the Burj"", which isnt something you get in the majority of hotels.  This made us feel very treasured.
Yes it is expensive but it is a once in a life time experience and something to be remembered.  It was a recommendation from a friend and it surpassed every expectation.","5","2013-05"
"As good as ever!","Stayed here for about the tenth time! 
We love the hotel and this year took our 9 month old baby for the first time. The facilities provided by the hotel for Will were fantastic and most of the things that we packed we didn't need! 
Superb staff, excellent service, great food........another fantastic experience. 

Only downside....it seemed that the hotel was very empty.... Whilst it was nice having the pool to ourselves most days, other guests would have improved the atmosphere as it is a little soulless at times... Maybe Jumeirah should review its pricing structure as it is becoming v expensive to stay there relative to other comparable places.

"Luxury at its best","We stayed there for one night to celebrate my wedding anniversary. They gave excellent service, greeted us like a vip protocol. They gave us early check in at 12 noon and late check out at 4 pm. They also gave us surprise cake and bouqet. The amenities and give aways like full range of hermes products are fabulous. Free unlimited access to private beach and wild wadi was an added advantage. Breakfast buffet was quite impressive. The staff is extra courteous and fully trained especially Rishna was too cooperative. Abra journey to all jumeirah hotels is another enjoyable by all feature. ","5","2013-06"
"decent hotel and remarkable moments","Have you had this feeling where you don't feel like leaving this hotel , well this is one of them , living there is everything you need , decent gym, great food bar lounge , and the location is very convenient   , i would love to stay there again someday .","5","2012-09"
"Worth the experience","What a room! And the service lived up to the 7* reputation. All the food was exceptional, not even a blemish on the fruit in the room. The interior of hotel and room is pure luxury. around every corner something to amaze you. by far the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in, forget about getting up and going shopping.","5","2013-01"
"Wow","OMG could not describe how we felt when we arrived, stepping out of our beautiful white limo into paradise to be greeted by the most beautiful immaculately dressed staff I have ever seen, and as for the suites over looking the sea, spacious elegant opulent need I say more, all the toiletries were Hermes and as for the fruit bowl we could have set up a market stall, every night we got gifts left on our beds (not just chocolates) one night I had a really bad headache and rang the butler (yes your own butler who unpacks for you) he came with a silver tray with red roses and little potions for my head ache wow.
I cannot wait to go back.","5","2012-10"
"Of all the hotels in all the world this is going to be tough to beat","10 SECOND SUMMARY

It's decoration is OTT, the suites have more room and amenities than you could possibly need: mirror over the sumptuous bed, huge jacuzzi, massive shower, wonderful sea view, office area, butler, all controlled from a console that will baffle all but the most techy; but this place genuinely is like no other hotel you have ever stayed in. Everything about the Burj Al Arab is out of the top drawer.

ACCOMMODATION

There really is little you can say about this and nothing you can criticise. It has earned it's place as one of the top places in the world to stay deservedly.

HOSTING

Go on! Test them! They will not be found wanting. Service at the Burj is to a standard that the best 5 star hotels on the planet can do nothing more than admire and aspire to.

Of all things we managed to lose a white gym sock. Given the sheer volume of linen it's perhaps no surprise that this $1 item got scooped up and probably sent off to the laundry. We mentioned it to the butler not thinking more of it. Hours later on our return from the beach the butler apologised that housekeeping had been unable to find it, but they had someone waiting in a sports shop and if we would let them know the size and make they would procure a replacement. 

We were shocked and for a $1 sock not particularly bothered about the replacement. The story doesn't end there. No more than 5 mins later the Head of Housekeeping turned up at our door profusely apologetic, gave us a goody bag of leather luggage tags and the like and promised us he would have the [$1] sock for us when we next visited.

FOOD

May be pricey but you are paying for very high quality incredibly well prepared. It's pricey then but also right up there with the best meals you will have. I'm no a seafood lover so we went to the Skybar - it was awesome.

Of course you also have access to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and Madinat Jumeirah (3 hotels and a Souk with a few more restaurants) so there is something for everyone.

AMENITIES

Yes. Everything you could wish for. The pool is small but with the white sandy beach a stones through away, crystal clear water and service that ensures you are never without complimentary cold towels an water it's no hardship.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Would we stay again? Oh yes.","5","2012-08"
"Amazing Unique luxurious","Burj Al Arab is the super famous, World’s Only seven Star Hotel.  After staying at this amazing hotel all I can say, if there were 10 stars I will give them all to the Burj. Everything about this hotel is unique, luxurious, the best in the world!

The Burj does nothing by halves. From the minute hotel car picked me up I felt like an Arabian princess being whisked away to the white tower.

Every room is amazing. The most special touches are mirror ceiling in the bedroom and the most spectacular views from every window. The butler service is also exceptional. While the beach is the best in Dubai.

It defintely deserves all of its seven stars! A must try for any romantic couple at least once in your lifetime.","5","2013-03"
"Amazing","I can't wait to go back there!

My boyfriend and I went and stay for only 3 days 2 nights and we love every minute of it. 

From the moment you step out of the limo, their staffs are all there to greet you and take care of everything for you. The keyless service is amazing. We didn't even need to bring our keys. Every floor has a butler and whatever you need, you just need to ask. 

The rooms are luxury and comfortable. We will definitely make another trip back. ","5","2012-11"
"Don't waste your time or money","I went for lunch here and was extremely disappointed. The entrance lobby was gaudy and quite vulgar and in need of a touch of paint in places.  The fish in the walls were a very nice touch and the escalators were imposing.  The view from the exterior lift was stunning.  But the food - yuck! The meat was tough and the side dishes boring.  Staff were very snooty.  Could they have afforded to eat here - I doubt it!  All in all not an experience I ever wish to repeat.  Save your money, take photos from the outside and then go to another of the pentiful 5 star hotels.","2","2013-02"
"Bye Bye Burj","Before i came here I read every review I could so that I could maximise my Burj experience.
I had wanted to come here to stay in the Burj ever since I saw it being deigned and built last century. Unfortunately Dubai kept building other iconic structures that I felt I had to wait for to make my trip complete. This culminated with the opening of the Burj khalifa and my decision not to wait for the next thing.
I have read reviews where people are disappointed by the cost, however this is not a place to base your views on cost. it is expensive but as many reviews will tell you, this is a once in a lifetime experience that you will never forget. from the moment the Rolls Royce Phantom picks you up until the last seconds when your car is taking you to your next destination, this establishment prides its self on its ability to deliver dreams. in thirty nine years of travelling I have stayed in many of the worlds leading hotels each one leaves its mark, but in the Burj you are living in a work of art, with such an iconic status it stands along side the Sydney Opera House,  The Guggenheim in Bilbao or any one of the great structures that many cities have built to grace their various metropolises. 
Before I arrived here I thought that Raffles Hotel  had the edge on more than thirty great hotels I had been lucky enough to stay in, but the Burj Al Arab has now gone to the top of the list.
Very good food is very good food where ever in the world you eat it but the knowledge, professionalism and warmth of the waiting staff everywhere in the hotel was memorable. This made my dining experiences even better than my previous top pick La Tour D'Argent, visited some fifteen years ago when Claude Terrail would sit with the diners and organise tours of his famous cellars. As Claude is now sadly departed I feel comfortable in passing his crown on to the Burj Al Arab.
Even poolside the Burj goes the extra mile with cool boxes containing water, ice and cool face towels for everybody. Cold smoothies, sorbets and lollipops handed out at regular intervals and a cooling sea breeze turned on every day to keep my temperature in check.
The rooms are superb but now comes my only idea for improvement. I requested a two bedded room, I knew in advance the beds would only be one meter wide, but in such a big bedroom, I cannot see why two super kings cannot be accommodated. The ceiling mirrors would have to be duplicated and possibly some rooms would have to be designated as rooms with two beds. This said my bed was comfortable, but I would have liked a bigger bed that is available in other great hotels.
I bring my review to a close with a warm thank you to the great staff in this work of art and just recall a scene I witnessed while waiting at the front door of a young thirty something girl stopping at the door as she was walking out and whispering "" Bye Bye Burj"" and wiping a tear from her wide eyes.","5","2013-06"
"Beautiful hotel","Really is outstanding. We sat at a restaurant opposite and he dinner while the hotel changed colour really was very pretty and unique. The rooms in side are fit for a prince and if you have money or really want to have a blow out holiday stay there!","5",
"A day of luxury","My husband and I did the package that included a couples massage and banquet Arabian dinner.From the moment you walked in the door the service was fantastic.Our Thai massage was held on the 18th floor in a room with amazing views of the ocean.The masseuse applied the perfect amount of pressure,total bliss.After our massage we were able to use the infinity pool for a swim before dinner.The buffet was one of the best I've been too,a large variety of well prepared dishes.
In all it was a fantastic highlight of our trip as we felt like royalty if just for one day!!","5","2013-06"
"It was worth it!","We stayed at the Panoramic One Bedroom Suite which was located at the corner ends of the tower providing us with amazing views of the sea and the city at the same time. All rooms are duplex suites with entrance and sitting areas located on the first level and sleeping areas on the second level. The interior decoration was very colorful, a bit over the top for my taste, but then again that was the overall characteristics of this hotel anyway. 

We came for the experience of staying in what is arguably the most luxurious hotel in the world and it was worth it. The price we paid was similar to what we would pay for suite rooms at other luxury hotel properties in the world. The difference is at this hotel all rooms are suites. Our room came with full sized Hermes toiletries, which was part of the package. The package included Mercedes Benz airport transfer that I upgraded to the Rolls Royce as I felt it was just right for that setting :-)

We tried 3 restaurants:
1) Dinner at Al Mahara; with the amazing aquarium setting the tone for the amazing dinner
2) Lunch at Al Muntaha on the 27th floor; amazing views and good European food
3) Breakfast at Junsui; wide array of Asian cuisine

All in all, what we experience was befitting of the setting - nothing was too special about the room but nowhere else a hotel affords all the experiences, the glamor, the food, the facilities - and they all just seemed appropriate here.","4","2012-11"
"Excellent but in need of modernisation","Great hotel, with an exaggerated service (you'll be disturbed every 30min). Lots of restaurants, great breakfast.","4",
"Too much service! Too much questions!","The hotel was fine in need of some modernisation. The service exaggerated (we were called every 30min) they are asking too many questions. The skyView bar is worthing to go (great views). The Al Mahara restaurant not worthing at all (plain food, no atmosphere).","4","2013-05"
"Dubai's best","Had an excellent stay and was very impressed by the property.  The New Years Eve celebrations are fantastic and the views from the suites are amazing.  Well worth booking although not the cheapest option in Dubai it is by far the best.","5","2012-12"
"Truly a star above the rest...","There is always that goes a little bit wrong when you stay in most five star hotels...I mean, seldom do you get that seamless experience, from the bellman when you arrive to the bellman when you depart. At the Burj Al Arab this was the case however. Greeted by name on arrival by three different members of staff, check-in in the room without a fuzz, complimentary fruit and wine on the table, a nice and informative welcome letter from the GM, an attentive butler bringing fresh fruit cocktails...really! Anyway, it all starts on the ground floor in opulent cruise ship like architecture rising to the skies, the finest bling surrounds one going to the elevators, the suites at the Burj (as friends of the hotel lovingly call the property) are spectacular, two storey, arabian Alice in Wonderland meets Versace splendour...extremely well appointed and extremely clean!
Room service or private dining, absolutely seven star, housekeeping and amenities luxurious, walk in closet space ample, bathroom arabian / roman, bedroom spacious and secretly sexy! Alas, well worth a couple of nights!","5","2013-06"
"Add to your bucket list","Staying at Jumeirah's Burj Al Arab, while very expensive, is definitely worth a try.  Overly large two-level suites with 180 degree open view of the Persian Gulf.  When it is over 100 degrees in Dubai and you are not into shopping, staying here is the place to be.  Service is most excellent.  While I am not a fan of butlers, our floor butler Antonio, was unbelievably helpful and arranged a wonderful surprise birthday greeting for my daughter.","5","2013-06"
"pure bliss","A must to do......you really need to spend a least one night here to appreciate what 7 star treatment is ,(going for tea here is like kissing your sister STAY a night!)  the staff are simply amazing I must of entered my room 20 times and never used a key once,  the attention to detail is superior to any hotel I have ever stayed,
The suites (all rooms are suites) are mind boggling  I was only on the second floor and was still high up and had spectacular views, its not cheap but its worth every cent,   check everything out from the cart ride to the beach and having your esky delivered to your deck chair to the indoor pool/spa a truly beautiful building as soon as I pay off my credit card I'm planning a return,..... its not a stay its a experience","5","2013-05"
"Unreal architecture and worth at least 1 night of your life","Staying at the Burj Al Arab has been on my list of places to stay for some time now.  I was really looking forward to this stay and did plenty of work upfront since there is not doubt, it is expensive.  I give some tips below on how to book to get the most for your value. The building and rooms are unbelievable and I do believe the Panoramic Suite is worth the upgrade (for me it was only 250usd extra, so in the grand scheme, not too much)

I do have to say there are a few things to consider before you decide to book:

- You want hand and foot service. What I mean by that is that you feel comfortable that at every possible moment someone is trying to ""do something"" for you.  Do you catch yourself saying ""no thanks, I'm ok""... then maybe you won't see the same value.  Or know ahead of time, just accept that it is their job to take care of you. Example: your butler will walk you to dinner...really not something I want...just want to spend some private time with my girlfriend vs forced conversation with a stranger.
- There isn't a lot of freedom to just do as you please.  Because they want every experience to be 7 star, and still be accommodating, you can't just go to the bar for a drink if you have a few minutes free.  Everything seemed to be ""you need talk to your Butler"", ""you need to talk to..."".  At the end of the day, they are VERY accommodating, but it has to be done by the book. Which can seem silly and just extra work.
- Because this is a place ""to be seen"" at, be prepared for other guests to have some attitude. This is true at all hotels in which there is a certain amount of people who want to be seen as staying there.  I find most of these people pretty laughable, so make the best of it and know just appreciate the opportunity to enjoy such fine things in life.

I elected to book through American Express fine hotel's and resorts (AmexFHR) program...this is available for black and platinum members.  When looking online directly through the website, the price was the same, but through AmexFHR, you get the early check in, late checkout (4pm), free bottle of wine, two 55 minute massages during your stay, and free breakfast.  This seemed the best way to get the most value.

My first suite was 612 and I wasn't too happy with this suite, it had a ""smoke"" smell in it which seemed to be from the previous guest.  After a phone call I was changed to room 1011 and felt the decor was better, the smoke smell was better, the size of the room was better(due to the curve of the building, the 10th floor is about the max size), as well as a great view.  Any complaints, they were there to fix it right away.

The Spa is great, spent a few hours there on two different occasions and was very satisfied with the infinity pool, spa, and services.  

The beach was nice as well.  It is a private beach and plenty of chairs with umbrellas.  A golf cart can take you right there and upon arrival, they provide you with a cooler with cold towels and bottles of water.

Overall, This hotel is a 5 star....don't start thinking 7 star unless you pay to arrive via helicopter, use the bentley's, etc...  The service is excellent, they do everything they can but be prepared for hand and foot service.  If they catch you carrying a small bag, you'll be asked time and time again if they can carry it.  The rooms are unreal and of course you'll spend a lot, but you'll always remember your stay at the Burj Al Arab.","5","2013-06"
"Suite 507","I get shivers down my spine each time I am made to recall my stay at the Burj al Arab. We stayed (3 of us) in a 2 bedroom suite in 2004.

I remembered we landed after 4 am in the morning on a flight from Singapore and had booked the hotel’s BMW transfer service from Dubai airport to the hotel.  We were met just after baggage reclaim by the hotel representative, fast tracked to a private immigration desk and before we knew it we were outside Dubai airport waiting for our car. This little experience gave me an insight into what it must surely be like for celebrities (and the like) because I cannot put in words the look on the other passengers faces as we glided past them.

Anyway our BMW was late and the representative kept apologising, not that I had realised it because we were out of that airport so quickly I was in a daze.  Five minutes later a Rolls Royce Phantom pulled up and one of the party went – that car is for us. To which I said no because I knew that I had booked a BMW. The representative kindly confirmed that the Rolls Royce Phantom was indeed for us the BMW and it’s driver were running late. Well we were definitely getting the looks from other waiting passengers then.  The driver came out, introduced himself presented me with a purple orchid in a sealed vase of water; an iced cold towel and a bottle of cold water.  It was very hot even at that time of the morning back in November 2004. 

So we left the airport and I do remember that once we got past where the Fairmont Hotel and Jumeirah Emirates Towers are, what is now an 8 lane Sheikh Zayed Road both ways was only a dusty path then. Other than the sister hotel Jumeirah Beach Hotel there were no buildings for miles around, the Burj was more or less stood there on its own.

On the way, our driver told us that the then ruler Sheikh Zayed had passed away and therefore certain activities were being kept to a minimum as a mark of respect. One of those activities was the changing of the lights on the outside of the Burj – that did not happen whilst we were there.

So we got to the Burj and were greeted personally by a member of staff and welcomed to the hotel. Immediately in front of us and nestled between 2 escalators were the dancing fountains in their cascading colors. I recall that out of respect these fountains were down to a trickle.  We were then handed over to another member of staff who told us about the areas of the hotel immediately around us and we were then escorted to our suite.

Suite 507 and where to begin...  These suites are huge, to help put into perspective they are bigger than the average 3 bedroom house in the UK. The entrance door on the suite is about twice the size of a  standard exterior house door.  

As you enter the suite, there is your personal office area on your left and this is where we checked in. Fully equipped with a desk, chair, computer, fax machine and paper and on your right is the spiral staircase to the 2 bedrooms. Further down the hall still on your left is a bar and then one of two lounge areas with wide screen television. Turn right and there is another living area where the walls, drapes and lounge chairs are a rich red accentuated with gold.  As a matter of fact everything seemed to have been dipped in some form of gold. Thru a door on your right is the fully stocked kitchen for you or your personal butler to prepare any meal you wish. Or you can simply order room service and have the meal layed out in the comfort of your lovely dining room which adjoins the kitchen.  You can happily host a formal dinner for 8 in this room. And then there is the backdoor for the butler to discreetly come and go.

By the time we had been shown the bedrooms our luggage was there waiting with the option for the butler to unpack it. 

Master bedroom – it has a king size bed with a mirror matching in size over it. Or was it a king size bed – I remember lying across it with my hands outstretched above my head and still did not touch the ends.  Not just a walk-in closet but a walk- in dressing room equipped with dressing table and stool – SATC still has some catching up to do!  And next to this is the bathroom or should I call it a spa with his and her sinks; bathrobes and slippers. 24 Faubourg  by Hermes 200 ml body lotion, and shower gel, I remember later checking the prices of these items in Harrods and thought – ooh!   Bidet, toilet, jacuzzi, ten point rain shower. I stood in the shower – arms outstretched and twirled without ever touching any of the beautiful mosaic tiles on the wall.  The color scheme in the master bedroom was cream and gold.

The color scheme in the 2nd bedroom carried shades of blue/green.  It also had a jacuzzi  - you need not share at the Burj or have to wait in turn. This is the room you would put the kids in – if you were a family of 4. 

Did I mention the floor to ceiling glass panels on each floor offering sweeping views of what was Dubai then? Sumptuous colors, marble and wooden panelling throughout the suite.

You need not ever get up from the comfort of your lounge chair. When the door bell rings, an image of the person at the door is displayed on the tv screen. The remote control for the tv has an access button and one simply presses that to let their guest in. A remote control also controls the temperature, lighting and the drapes.

When we were leaving, the butler gave us permission to take the Hermes products, a burj al arab laundry bag; burj al arab shoe bag (both made of cloth) burj al arab shoe horn, Burj al arab suit carrier.  I hasten to add I still have and treasure all of these items.

To top it all off, the following year when my daughter was born I received a beautiful bouquet of flowers from the then manager of the Burj, Mr Luc Delafosse. Now how is that for service beyond that which is required?

Did I feel like a princess? No, I felt like a queen and I am still reminiscing!","5","2013-06"
"the ultimate stay","a truly awesome place, I was there in May and had the beach almost to myself, the swimming pool was the only disappointment it wasn't a 7 star pool, but that doesn't detract from this magnificent place, hard to judge this beautiful icon if your just having high tea or drinks...its like kissing your sister..... put some dollars away and stay a night then you can see why this place earns its 7 stars!
I would have entered my room 20 times in one day/night from restaurants, pools indoor/outdoors spars etc. and never opened my own door once? the butler service is overwhelming never forgot my name very very personalised service from all staff, from your first stop at security they are on the ball......very professional people in the most beautiful hotel in the world","5",
"Wonderful place","one of the greates building in dubai that will keep you questioning how it was made. the fancy cars, the large carpet in the floor, the design and colors on the walls, and pearl floor.
and the resturants will shock you with their menu.","4",
"One for the bucket list!","While in Dubai we stayed one night here. If you are looking to experience the true meaning of opulence then this is the place for you! 
The whole place is amazing, if you do stay here make sure you spend an hour in the horizon pool on the 14th floor the views are simply stunning. ","5","2013-04"
"Cannot get better than this!","Going to stay in such a prestigious hotel, our expectations were high and I was a little concerned that we may be some way disappointed. How wrong could I be! We have never experienced anything like this - it was superb from the moment we pulled up at the main entrance until we left. The staff are attentive without being intrusive, and the hotel itself is just spectacular. Yes it is expensive for food and drinks etc., but what do you expect? You are staying in arguably the best hotel in the world.
In every single way, I cannot fault this hotel. We stayed for 3 nights and they were all a wonderful experience. We topped off the experience by taking the culinary flight on our last night. This is exuberant, but highly recommended. If, like us, this is probably a once in a lifetime treat (although we are planning a return!!), then this 'meal' is a must. The food and especially the service received throughout is an absolutely unique experience that is worth every penny.
I have read some of the less complimentary reviews on this hotel, and frankly I am amazed. If anyone wants any more than this - even for the money - then they want too much!!","5","2013-05"
"Spoilt for life @ Burj Al Arab","Celebrating my 50th & our 25th Wedding anniversary we spent 3 nights from 31.5.13 to 3.6.13 at the Burj al Arab. From the start to the unfortunate finish, our stay was sublime. The staff were absolutely fantastic, the whole stay was fabulous. The butler greeted us at our suite, demonstrated all of the amenities which took about 20 minutes. Nothing was a problem for the staff, restaurants were phenomenal, an experience that will stay in our memories for ever.","5","2013-05"
"Best of the best!!!!!!!","We spent three incredible nights at this outstanding 2 floors suite. Amazing service. Stunning hotel, the decor is slightly overwhelming but overall fantastic. Mattress and pillows are out of this world, fresh roses, expresso machine, Hermes complimentary amenities, Rolls Royce pickup at the airport, big Apple computer, buttler 24 hours, definitely the most luxurious hotel in the world.","5","2013-05"
"Beware Of The Hidden Catches !","7 star unadulterated luxury, butlers who'll take every part of 2 hours to explain the room amenities security checks at every lift and exit, The Burj delivers on the Grandeur expectations of a wonderful Hotel.
The expertly trained butlers deliver different treats fresh every night, allowing you to indulge and be spoilt. The luxurious His n Hers Hermes toiletries and amenities in the bathroom make the stay complete. Even the remote control blinds can be closed using the TV controller, and the mattress is simply luxurious with a mirror over the entire bed making for a 'different' sleep on pillows which are simply to die for.... Individual red roses and luxurious lip balms are left on the pillows every night. Sounds idyllic ...

So why with all of this does The Burj, employ Managers like Asstnt Housekeeping Manager Gurung Om, and Guest Services Manager Denis Demshin both of whom I had the unfortunate experience of meeting over an issue I had with replacement of bathroom amenities. Why did the Power Happy Mr Om & Mr Demshin need to make such a fuss over a matter they could have fixed in 2 minutes ?
Suddenly my perfect 7 star experience was shattered by this penny pinching, bean counting pair  telling me if I'd stayed in the hotel for a week I could have replacements, but as I'm only staying 3 nights I can only have tooth brushes and shaving kits replaced together with shampoo !
Can you believe it ? with the room rates the Burj Charges.
The butlers turn out to be powerless on problem solving, that's left to the hard faced managers like Gurung Om and Denis Demshin.
As a 6 times repeat guest I expected more... 
We all have choices and maybe  'The World's Most Luxurious Hotel'  needs to think more about that ...

"Superb","My husband and I have spent one night at Burj al Arab to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We live in Dubai and we had never considered staying overnight in Dubai, but Burj al Arab is an experience itself. From the warm welcome upon arrival, the service was outstanding. The two-floor suite had breathtaking views of The Palm and Dubai Marina... everything was beautiful. Some special touches, like a gagdet to control everything from the tv to the curtains; a huge bathrom with jacuzzi and Hermes toiletries, including perfumes; a mirror above the bed; amazing bed and pillows... but the best is the staff. We hav stayd at many properties around the world, but at Burj al Arab, nothing is impossible. Having a 24-hour butler at your own disposal makes everything easy and smooth. Abdullah, our butler, was just amazing. We got free entry tickets to the waterpark Wild Wadi, a must-do. The breakfast was great. We also tried the Spa and had two massages. The best massages ver! Ying, my therapist, was amazing! Unfortunately, we did not try any of the restaurants, but we will do soon for sure! The lobby is stunning. Thank you Burj al Arab for such an experience! And for the cake and roses bouquet on our anniversary... nice touch.","5","2013-05"
"Sublime service","I visit many hotels per year on business and pleasure, and I am pleased to confirm the al Arab is by far the one and if not the best hotel I have visited. The service and staff are beyond welcoming and whilst staying there they cannot do enough for you. Yes the decor is dazzling and slightly overwhelming but meeting clients in the grandeur of the hotel can only add weight of what they mean to you and your company.

I would like to complement jumeriah on a stunning hotel and amazing service.","5","2013-06"
"Best hotel in the world? Absolutely.","There are a few hotels in the world that I adore. Just a handful really. Places we call home when we travel because the facilities and the service are beyond good. The level of service at The Burj is beyond these. It surpasses them and then some. 
If you love luxury and you love service like we do, then go to the Burj. Like the Peninsula Hong Kong, we felt as though we could happily just spend 3 or 4 days in the hotel complex without leaving. (Not that we did, but we could have!) 
There are too many amazing things to list and the luxury of the rooms is not captured in photos. The level of service provided is astonishing. Even at the luxury prices they charge, how they make money with so many employees to cater to the guests was beyond comprehension. For example we came back to the room (house sized) in the late afternoon to find the cleaning team doing turn down. There were 4 of them! 
You will be made to feel like royalty when you stay there. I can't wait to go back! We wondered what we would do in Dubai now that it is Qantas' link to Europe. We would definitely go to the Burj.","5","2013-06"
"Home From Home","Feel sooo totally at home here....not a problem at all from the fab doormen on entering especially Dusko who feels like an old friend now. I remember thinking the first time we stayed here that we would feel out of our depth in this hotel but felt like home hence why we keep going back. We had friends for dinner in Al Iwan and chef Mohammed made sure we were looked after as always. Abbas at the pool had our lounger ready for us each day and would always have a big smile on his face. Sumi and her team are fab as usual in Bab Al Yam as love the choice available for breakfast. Our suite was always immaculate and Nehza made it look beautiful with red roses for our arrival. We had a few butlers to look after us this time and my husband celebrated a birthday and we had the trio of singing butlers and he was surprised but delighted. The beach bar is my favourite as the service is second to none guided by Satish and his great team so thank you all. We are already booked for later this year thanks to the ever patient Nimal 😎😎😎😎. Our problem has been since first staying at the hotel we cannot find anywhere else to match it and feels indeed like my second home. Seeing and staying is truly amazing so try for yourself.","5","2013-05"
"Save your money","I stayed in the Burj Al Arab for the final night of our honeymoon. It was a surprise to my wife as she wanted to go and have a look at this hotel earlier in our holiday and I made every excuse not to go. 

I found dealing with this hotel via email very difficult to impossible, I had to call them from the UK in the end. The Burj Al Arab fell very short on the standards set by the other hotels we had stopped in during out trip. I felt like they didn't much care, almost taking the attitude 'we are the best if you don't like it shove it'. After reading many reviews and the reply's the Burj al arab seem to give to people that do voice the issues they have had, this sort of backs up my the poor attitude.  

We flew from Phuket into Dubai and I'd booked a Rolls Royce airport transfer. We arrived at the airport and our bags took a while to come through. We walked straight through with many of the other passengers from our flight and I was expecting to easily identify the chauffeur and be helped with our heavy luggage. This should have been the nice moment my new wife realised our honeymoon was to come to a fantastic end with a night in the Burj Al Arab. However the chauffeur wasn't there, I checked all round twice inside the terminal taking fifteen mins. I had to fend of a load of questions from my wife who thought I had messed up the last part of our trip. She was getting upset and was heading off to get a taxi. I had to tell her our plans at this point and we then went to look outside the airport. I didn't think a Rolls Royce would be to hard to see, and I was correct. I approached the chauffeur and he confirmed he was waiting for me and told me he had been waiting inside for ages and had just come back out in the last few moments. It was safe to say in the 15 mins it took me to thoroughly check round the areas where chauffeurs wait inside, I can guarantee he was not there, his uniform stood out a mile and he would have been easy to spot. The surprise had been spoilt and given the cost of that service I expected him to stand there all day if needed. 

We found there was very little information to hand in the room and we ended up going on the Apple Mac to check the hotel facilities. We where told on arrival at our room that we would need to book to have a drink or a meal, we asked if we could do this and when the butler came back we where told 10:30 for the sky lounge is the only time.  Hungry and tired we asked for options and that was the best. Really poor, you can't get a reservation at a sensible time to eat in the hotel your staying in and they don't inform you, you need to book in advance. I booked a meal in khao lak Thailand six months in advance and even told them what we would like to eat and selected the wines we drank, had I been told I would need to book in advance I would have booked the day I confirmed my booking. We took the 10:30 appointment to go for a cocktail. They where good and there was lots to choose from however very overpriced.     

We stayed in a panoramic suit and it was fantastic, we where really pleased. I ran a bath and put some bubble bath in there so we could relax. I put the Jacuzzi function on and went away for five mins, when I came back there was a dark scum all round. I emptied the bath cleaned it and ran it again. I jumped in and it didn't take long to notice the scum again, I had been swimming and showering multiple times a day for three weeks. There is no way this scum came from me, we had a Jacuzzi in all four hotels and this was the only one where this scum formed so it looked like they needed to clean there filters or something. The complimentary red wine in our room felt a bit back handed,  it was a cheap £10 bottle, this should have been a bottle of the Burj Al Arab's own branded wine available in the mini fridge or a bottle of some form of refreshing fizz guests can enjoy. It felt like the red wine was aimed at bringing an degree of sophistication however it was just seemed tacky due to the quality.     

With the lack of dining options we decided to order room service so we just ordered a simple pizza and a beef burger to share. The food arrived quickly and the service was great however it was really disappointing value. I don't believe the most luxurious hotel in the world should serve cheap rubbish. The pizza had turkey roll on it, the type you put in a sandwich. That's not very luxurious at all. The burger was requested medium and came rare to blue in the middle, I couldn't eat it however my partner was ok with it. Again very disappointing. All drinks are very over priced even for a bottle of water the Champaign is Four or Five times over priced, the in room bar snacks are just stupid money. As an example It would have been cheaper to open the triple £ figure bottle of Dom Pérignon I had bought, than buy any of the champagne on offer! At least I would have felt like I was drinking something special for the price, and most the Champaign on offer was more expensive for a lesser brand than the bottle I had.   

The worst attention to detail and biggest upset other than the spoilt surprise was check out. I received an Australian man's invoice containing his name, address and all other contact details, how he paid ect. Can't help but wonder who has my information and invoice and what the hotel does to prevent breaches in data protection like this, quite shambolic for the most luxurious hotel in the world that prides itself on service.

£1500+ per night for middle of the road service, poor food, fantastic room excluding the dirty Jacuzzi and poor attention to detail giving out personal details. 

Overall the hotel is amazing architecturally and quite a site to see. It does seem and feel far more interested catering to people that just want to nip in for a look round a meal or drink than it's guests. I planed a spectacular end to our honeymoon in the worlds most luxurious hotel and the surprise I had kept secrete for so long was gone due to poor service. 

Very disappointing.","3",
"Best of Dubai - Burj Al Arab","The hotel stated it was a 7 star hotel. My rating system was 1-5 and I could not believe a hotel could register above a HIGH 5. I was wrong. The hotel exceeded expectations in nearly every topic. If you do not mind paying the price then this is the place to stay.

Each room is two levels and the size of a medium size apartment that is furnished with the best of the best including electronics.

You do not need a key to the room because you are escoted to and from your room. Once you step off the elevator there is always someone to help you with ANYTHING which includes escorting you to your room and opening it.

The views from the room are incredible. One note of how to improve would be that the windows need to be cleaned more often. Being on the ocean in the desert presents a problem of keeping windows crystal clean.

I am not sure I would rate it a seven star but it was the nicest true hotel by a long shot that I have ever stayed in.

Definately worth the price for a 2 or 3 day stay.","5","2013-04"
"Burj Al Arab is certainly a 7 stars hotel!!!!!","My husband and I had the opportunity to stay at Burj Al Arab at the end of our cruise in Dubai, I used to work as a General Manager in the hospitality business therefore I had a great interest of staying at this particular hotel and get my own opinion. In a few words I just can say  that it deserves to be considered the only 7 stars hotel in the world!!! The customer service is beyond any expectations, the positive attitude of all their employees makes you feel welcome all the time. The architecture of course is unique, the view of the Palm is fantastic from the Restaurant or bar at the 27th floor during the day and at night. It was an unforgettable  experience. Great value for your money. Oh, the best pillows to sleep and you can choose from 27 types.","5","2013-05"

"Family Middle East Holiday","As part of a UAE multi-location holiday we used the Burj Al Arab as our hotel for our time in Dubai and we were very glad we did. We were traveling as family of 4 (2 kids aged 9&14) and we were treated like royalty. Rooms of course are wonderful with the signature Burj Al Arab decor throughout and all the various bit and pieces that make it feel like a real treat. Our butler brought playstations in for the kids along with games and chocolates and they were left some form of little gift each night. Lots of little touches that make all the differences.
On the downside, the hotel restaurants do not cater for kids on an evening, perhaps at least offering an early slot for families 6:30 til 8pm would be helpful.
Breakfast and lunch options excellent, beach and pool service excellent.
In terms of getting around, many of the larger shopping malls are close enough by in a cab so its a good place to base yourself out of too.
All in all, cannot fault the place, really looked after us and we all really enjoyed the experience.","5","2013-04"
"Best birthday stay ever!!!!!!!!!","Just spent four nights celebrating my 50 th birthday.
This class act hotel went above and beyond to make sure I had a memorable birthday.Did they ever deliver the goods.My best hotel stay ever and I've been to over 60 countries and stayed at many five star resorts.
This truly delivers its billed 7 star service.
The staff here are truly remarkable and well trained.Everyone was helpful,polite,generous - I don't have enough adjectives.I felt like I left family behind when we checked out.
I honestly believed a hotel of this calibre,price range and star rating would be pompous and snobby.This was not the case.
We were well taken care of.Every need carefully provided for.The staff works hard and listens to make sure you are treated like royalty.
Management has done an amazing job hiring fantastic people from all over the world.
I have net even mentioned the wonderful suites with sweeping views.Awesome.
True luxury in every sense but with down to earth service.
If you can you have to do the Culinary Flight.THE hi light of my stay.We had the opp to try different food at 6 different restaurants over a five hour period.
The Tea service at SkyView bar was a delight as well with amazing views.
Thank you thank you thank you for a wonderful birthday and all the cakes,flowers and birthday songs.
I'm sad I'm no longer there but will return.","5","2013-05"
"There is no better hotel on the planet! It must be on your bucket list.","My friend and I went to Dubai to celebrate his 50th birthday. We stayed at the Burj Al Arab for 4 nights. Well I am speechless. It was the most incredible experience of our lives. This is undeniably the best hotel on the planet. The hotel is a masterpiece in architecture not only from the outside but also the inside. In addition, the rooms are incredible. We booked a 1 bedroom suite which was 2 levels with living room, office , and powder-room downstairs and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. The views were incredible. We were on the 12th floor. We had a small problem of being woken up at 430 am by guests in another suite. We called the butler to complain and this was promptly addressed. In the morning a member of the management team (Rafia) came to our suite to apologize and moved us to a 2 bedroom suite on the 15th floor. Well, we were overwhelmed when we toured the 3600 sq ft suite with an office, living room, dining space in 1 area with an adjoining master living room with large dining area and kitchen. The views of the Palms were incredible. Upstairs were the master bedroom and guest bedroom both with seating areas and large bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs,showers , double sinks. Loved the TV in the master suite which was hidden and popped up when the remote was activated. The management is a class act and we did not expect them to make this move from a $1600 per night room to one costing over $4000 per night. In addition the hotel provided high end toiletries by Hermés and freely replaced  them daily- this always brought a smile each day. 

Each floor has its own butlers who are very friendly and helpful. I would encourage you to get to know them. Your stay will be enhanced as a result. Gary from China was very helpful with his insightful suggestions. On the night of my friends 50th birthday the door bell rang and 4 butlers came in with a cart filled with champagne, bouquet of roses as well as a birthday cake and they had a guitar player with them and then proceeded to serenade him with the Happy Birthday song. We were both moved to tears. What a class act. 

We also participated in the Culinary Flight with wine parings. It was amazing. We started off in the Sky Bar for cocktails where we were greeted by Stephan from Ecaudor.   The Manager from each Restaurant greets you each time and escorts you to the next restaurant; you have 1 course from each. We then moved over to Al Muntaha for our first course of oysters and champagne. The view from these first 2 areas were breathtaking. We then went to Al Iwan for jumbo prawns. Next we were met by Tracy (originally from China) in Junsui Chinese restaurant-amazing swarovski crystals decorated the bar area. The jumbo scallops were excellent. Tracey was a delight to chat with. The next stop was Al Mahara were had an incredible dinner served by the charming Vadim from Russia. The giant aquarium was spectacular to view during dining. Hopefully you will see our friend Mr George! We finished with desert at Sahn Eddar where the wonderful staff (Ramesh from Nepal and Anhu and Alpha from Indonesia) again celebrated my friends birthday. The food was excellent as were the wine parings and this total flight lasted almost 6 hours-you can go at your own pace!

You also have to make time for their beach and pool area with spectacular sunset views. 
Although the prices seem expensive, it is well worth money as everything is impeccably executed. Kudos to the manager,Heinrich Morio, and his excellent team. 

We departed 2 days ago and are fondly looking to return soon.

"Lived up to its 5* reputation","We spent 2 nights here before embarking for a cruise and were blown away by the luxury and opulence of the hotel, and more particularly our suite.

Our Summer Dream package, available for stays longer than 2 days, included airport/port transfers, breakfast, dinner, 25 minute massage, luxury toiletries, etc.

The lobby and welcome greeting from the staff on arrival gives some hint of what is to come, but could not have prepared us for what is certainly the most spectacular accommodation we have ever stayed in during many years of travel.

Each floor has a dedicated team of butlers/concierges to service all your needs, but it is the actual suite itself that leaves you breathless.

From the expansive lounge/sitting area, spiral staircase to the upstairs bedroom, closet/robe area and bathroom.

The bathroom was huge with a full size spa and over-generous shower, finally the bedroom that in itself was bigger than most hotel rooms.

Beautiful fittings everywhere, large flat screen TV's, small gifts at night on the bed, comfortable slippers and robes and attentive staff, I'm not sure one could ask for anything else.

When we were being shown the room features we were asked if the pillows and mattress were to our liking, and were changed during the day to a firm pillow for my wife, and firm mattress; YES they actually changed the mattress to meet our needs.

Sure it is not cheap but when you consider what you get and the experience you have it is a once in a lifetime splurge that cannot be replicated.","5","2013-05"
"One of this kind","One of this kind, must to visit at least once. It is an experience. Would recommend to stay at the hotel for few nights and use every facility, beach etc.. Everything is beautiful and worth every penny. Those tiny double rooms are just above expectations","5","2012-06"
"Expect the very best.....","It's all been said before but from the moment you are greeted to the moment you leave you are treated like Royalty. The staff cant do enough for you. Service was perfect. We are a family of seasoned travellers and have stayed in numerous high end properties over the years. This was our first stay but it will not be our last.
The duplex suites are huge with every possible amenity you could ever want. The butler will be there as often or as little as you wish. The Hermes toilettries are worth a fortune by themselves. Two bars in your room - one upstairs and one down. Complementary wine on arrival, Arabic sweets and daily fruit are supplied.The staff treated the children especially well with their own child size dressing gowns, slippers and a bath toys. After first arriving we were taken on a tour of the hotel. Restaurants were described in great detail, including how suitable each one was for us with two children. When we were shown around the pool area the kids didn't have their swimming costumes with them (they were back in the room) but they really wanted a swim so the Butler went back upstairs to get them for us! Every member of staff greeted us and we were offered countless treats whilst on the tour.
The lobby bar area was elegant with music being played from a Grand piano. We enjoyed fabulous drinks with a wonderful view that overlooks The Jumeriah Beach Hotel.
The decor is incredibly opulent with golds, reds and purples being a common theme. Some have said that this is too over-the-top but it's exactly what we expect and want to see from such a property. 
Yes, this is an expensive hotel, but when you take into account the size of the rooms, the toilettries, the little extras, the most exceptional service levels, we left feeling like we'd had exceptional value for money.
We did not want to leave and plan to return either later this year or next.","5","2012-08"
"As Good as it Gets","I watched the National Geographic documentary on the making of the Burj Al Arab and never thought it would live up to me expectations... but it blew them out the water.  This is by far the most opulent hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.  The service is impeccable, the interior detailing transcendent and the food decadent.
The wallet could only handle one night, but it was well worth it.","5","2013-03"
"burj al arab","i liked every thing about this play 7 stars 24 hr butler & maid service the rooms the amazing breakfast choice","5",
"Another Great Memory","When the Rolls pulled up at entrance and I exited with my roses ( a gift when car picked me up) I knew my decision to indulge myself was worth it. I was meet by my lady hostess who escorted me into the foyer, where I was given a cool towel, a date and a small cup of Arabic coffee. We then ascended on escalators to lift where we entered and on exiting proceeded down hall to be meet by my butler and escorted to my suite. On arrival there I was booked into the Burg in my office while I sat. As you come through the door it is once again confirmed this is no ordinary hotel, sweeping stairwells lead to the second floor, and in front of you is an enormous living area. However what made this a wonderful experience was the staff they where outstanding and a credit to whoever employees them. The surrounding where opulent, the food great, I left laden with gifts which my butler insisted where mine to take. Usually I refuse to use any thing that comes branded, but my gift of beach bag tastefully displaying The Burg Al Arab name and Logo is used with pleasure and has been a life saver as I travel. Yes it is expensive, but for that once in a life memory, I say hang the expense and go for it..I invited friends to join me for dinner nothing like sharing to make things better, as we left dining room we all received a huge bunch of roses..not sure if this was special but sure made us feel that way.","5","2013-04"
"Once in a Lifetime","This has got to be experienced - the other reviews make excellent attempts, but nothing compares with stepping into the lobby and then stepping into your suite and thinking - ""Hey, this is bigger than my condo!""  Be sure to have an overpriced drink at the rooftop bar, dinner on the beach and breakfast on the patio.  Wonderful lifelong memories!!!!","5","2012-11"
"Bull Al Arab","I always wanted to stay here but I just couldn't justify the price tag, so when I was going back to Dubai  I said let's do it, only there for two days . Boy oh boy, not worth the price tag. You have so many great places to stay at half the price with the same service or better.  The places looks like a cruise ship or something out of Vegas , funny, nothing elegant about this place. The services is good , food is ok , and rooms have my grandmother's eye.  4 star for sure bordering on 5 but with those prices you better have things right. It seems that most of the staff are clueless about their own hotel. I just expect so much more, I left very disappointed!! maybe it was because I didn't have my wife with me to laugh at everybody who believe this place is one of the best of the best, bull al arab. Lol","3","2013-04"
"POOR SHOW","Not much to say, apart from:

No toiletries in bathroom
After 3 requests to butler still no toiletries
Lost our luggage
From 5 unti 8 pm trying to trace luggage
Lied to during those 3 hours - being told its on its way etc.
Unable to go out to dinner as a result
No shower - no clothes

"Best Hotel Indeed !!!","I went to dubai for a marriage and we had an extra day off. We were a group of friends and we stayed at Burj. It was a fantastic and the most amazing experience we had. The hotel was good, everything about it was great. Later after staying, we discovered that it is the only 7 start property in the world (not sure though). Well, the lounge on the 27th floor (Al-muntana) was great. It was indeed a life time experience.","5","2013-02"
"Amazing as expected","Fantastic hotel and a fantastic experience.

The standard rooms are everything but standard – 170 m2, 2 floors , your own computer, 2 large TV’s, free wine upon arrival, your own butler and I could go on and on. Everything about the rooms is superb. 

The facilities are also amazing, the spa and the gym is spacious and almost without guests. Everything is very clean and luxurious. 

The restaurants are expensive (not a surprise) and serves great breakfast and dinner. 
Pool Area is nice, and the service excellent (you’ll get free ice cream, drinks, wet towels etc). However, the pool areas on the sister hotels are equally nice, and they also have equally nice beach.","5","2013-05"
"Unexceptional service lacking initiative and interest...","Living in Dubai I took advantage of the UAE residents rate which is still expensive at just over AED 6000/-  Overall a big disappointment:  

On completing the in-room check-in the guest service agent mentioned the room rate out loud and how much would be blocked on my credit card. This is totally unacceptable as my guest should not be aware of what was being paid. I then had to remind her that she required ID's to complete the reservation.  She was not aware of either of my restaurant reservations although I had made them at the time of the room reservation. The Butler who then gave the suite orientation was not aware of my restaurant reservations either.  Both the Butler and the GSA asked where I had booked afternoon tea for the Friday, Sahn Eddar or Skyview Bar and I had to remind them both that afternoon tea was not available in Skyview Bar due to Friday brunch.    

Junsui Thursday dinner:  The food and service was excellent.  The ambience however was horrendous and reminded me of eating in an upmarket road side diner catering for coach parties.  The dress code was not enforced and the overall experience was anything but exclusive.  The wine by the glass was very overpriced. 
 
Al Iwan Friday breakfast:  An extremely average breakfast.  Better is served in other Jumeirah properties.  No pork station and you had to ask if it was available rather than someone explaining this to you or being advised at the time of check-in so that you could make a more informed choice of where to have breakfast.

Floor reception:  On exiting the room on Thursday afternoon 3 staff were at the floor reception, none of whom raised their heads and acknowledged me.  After Friday breakfast before going to the gym I asked the floor receptionist for new towels.  It was not done.    

Gym Friday morning:  No interaction from the staff and unlike on Thursday afternoon, no cold towels being offered. 

Sahn Eddar afternoon tea:  A very pleasant experience.  However, we ordered 2 afternoon tea between 3 of us and an extra plate had to be requested at almost every course so that the 3rd person could share some of the food.  Water should be included in the price as AED40/- for a bottle of water is unacceptable.    

Departure:  The luggage was not ready with the car and although the car had been brought to the front door the luggage arrived sometime later which meant that the car had to be moved again as it was blocking the entrance.  Very embarrassing.

Wild Wadi:  Was closed and we had not been advised of this at the time of making the reservation or prior to arriving.  We had intended to spend Thursday there but had changed or minds last minute due to the cold weather.  Just as well as this would have been another disappointment. 

I was thoroughly impressed by the condition of the hotel as it looked as good as new.  However, generally the staff were not exceptional in any way, lacking interest and initiative.   This was reinforced by the response from the GM one month later which was evidently a cut, copy paste job email in different coloured fonts showing no real concern for any of the issues I raised.","2","2013-01"
"Quite incredible...","I was privileged enough to stay here on one occasion, many years ago, and thought I really ought to get around to leaving a review. 

The Burj Al Arab is magical. 

We were made to feel special from the very start, and our stay was only one night. Sometimes it can be difficult when a hotel has a great reputation, you can build so much expectation...people tend to over analyse and leave mad reviews, but this is a Dubai 'experience' and on my stay I was blown away.

It's clear from the outset that this hotel is a different level to anything else. The lobby design is incredible, the rooms are outrageous, the butler service is spot on, and the view from the restaurant down across the Palm is something special- all incredible, of course in many ways it feels too much, over-indulgent so I can't say I would want to stay there for a long period of time, but it is a must if you can whilst in Dubai.

The food was excellent, over priced on reflection, but when in rome.  We (party of four) had no issues during our stay, and loved every minute. 

Overall an amazingly luxurious stay, hopefully I’ll get a chance to go back sometime in the future.","5","2012-05"
"Spectacular hotel","I brought some friends here for a fun weekend for my birthday.  Unfortunately by the time we arrived via helicopter we’d already spent several hours at a beach club and were all rolling drunk.  Even so, the photos suggest that we were greeted very warmly right from the helipad with a bouquet and red carpet, and the hosts were kind enough to take group photos of us at our request.  

In planning for the weekend I’d had to send passport copies of all passengers to the concierge and had specifically asked that all guests be allowed in the room between landing and dinner (only an hour).  Despite this, we had continuous problems with the room butlers knocking and saying they had an issue with 8 people in a room booked for 4 without their IDs.  Their reasons were ridiculous, ranging from “insurance problems” to a “fire hazard”, hardly believable when the room is bigger than an average house.  I referred them to my contact at concierge who I'd sent the passport copies to but they said he’d left for the day.  Clearly not my problem. 

Dinner at Junsui was fabulous, the suite was absolutely spectacular and the butler service was useful, booking a buggy for us to hang out at the beach the next morning.  Breakfast was pretty good at the poolside restaurant although I was kind of expecting something a bit more special.  Can’t imagine what I thought would be there, perhaps a live pancake station or something but all of the food was first class even if the coffee service was a bit slow.  

Loved the attendants at the pool and beach, they provided cold towels, spritzers and waters etc.  There is a really lovely bar and private beach area called the Majlis and the buggy there takes just a few minutes, from the water there is a good view back to the hotel.  The pool itself was cute but not very big.  It wasn't overrun with kids though which is good for a Dubai hotel on a weekend!  The swim up bar wasnt open even though I was ready for a cocktail by 10am... 
 
Checking out was a pain, my card didn’t swipe and it took a good 15 minutes of faffing around before the butler decided to input the details manually.  I thought they’d offer us a car to come home to the marina (its only a 10 minute drive) but they stuck us in a local taxi and that was it.  

Overall it was an amazingly luxurious weekend, hopefully I’ll get a chance to go back.","4","2013-04"
"An Experience","This was a fun weekend away that I treated myself to while residing in Dubai.  Expensive of course, but I think worth it for the experience.

My one disappointment: I paid for the room for a stay by myself and as is to be expected, I didn't get a discount for only being one person paying for a two person roomrate - of course I paid the full roomrate.  So it came as a bit of a surprise that only the women's toiletries were provided.  Given that the toiletries are full size Hermes products and worth several hundred dollars, I enquired as to whether I could be afforded the full set of toiletries (to pass on to a friend) given that I had paid for the full price of the room for two people.  I was told it was not allowed but that on this occasion they would make an exception.  Single person's discrimination much?

Aside from that, the stay was lovely.  My personal butler was very attentive (although you share him with the rest of the rooms on that floor - however you don't really use his services all that much, it's just a perk of the hotel), as were the staff at the restaurants.  The staff at the Skyview Bar were really lovely when I went there for dinner.  The night view with expansive lights shining is pleasant.  Concierge staff were also awesome.  Upon viewing the in-room magazines, I realised I needed something a little less business like for reading material in the spa bath and went down to the concierge desk to see if they could help.  With a smile, one of the staff went off and returned with three leisure magazines which I was greatly appreciative of.

The room is not so much a room, but an apartment.  I so very much wanted to live in something similar - though the decor is a bit gaudy, but hey, when in Rome.  Two story apartment which even has a half bathroom downstairs.  The bed is heavenly.  Such a comfortable, restful sleep with no traffic or street sounds to be heard (given you're on an island!) and you wake up to a beautiful seaview.

The spa was fine.  Probably not the best I've been to in Dubai in terms of massage, but again, it's the whole experience and saying that you've done these things at the Burj Al Arab that count.  I went for the La Prairie facial and massage package.

The private beach here is gorgeous and access to it comes with the room.

Breakfast is nice, but nothing special.  Ask for a table with a view - pretty much every table has a glorious seaview but I was positioned in front of the barista stall and only had a view of the guys clearing the tables and making coffee.

Overall recommended, even for just a night to have the experience.  I'll return for the high tea and culinary flight meals as well.","4","2012-12"
"Wow!","We stayed in the Burj al Arab during our honeymoon.  We werr greeted at the airport and transfered to the hotel in a rolls royce. The room was spectacular and the amentities were fantastic.

I would definitely stay here again!","5","2013-04"

However food and drink bill will amass afer a week so you need to try a few places outside hotel. This is easy as plenty of restaurants nearby","5","2012-10"
"Simply flawless. Even better than we hoped.","With all the hype over this '7 star' resort I was concerned we were paying for the 'brand' or simply 'reputation' but the whole experience was simply magic. 

Beyond the amazing visuals that treat you with every look (both inside and out) there was the top shelf service. 
The staff were great, they didn't seem to treat the people who saved up for a one night experience any different to those arriving by private helicopter really. 

Anyone inside can look forward to a warm and welcoming experience which was possibly the biggest pleasant surprise of our visit. 

Well done to the team @ Burj Al Arab. Surprisingly worth every cent!!","5","2013-04"
"Last word in luxury","Exceptional from being checked in to wonderful food, especially afternoon tea. It just keeps coming and every thing is so beautifully presented by careful and professional staff. take a trip up to the top bar and experience views to take your breath away.","5","2013-01"
"Love the Burj!","We always enjoy our time here, yes it is not perfect where is, our door was left open all day by cleaning staff and they tried to charge us for a child's bed when we had booked for 3 adults!  However, the suite is magnificent, OTT but very clean and tidy, not keen on mirror over bed as always worry it is going to fall on top of me.  Love the Hermes products they provide, massages were good, pool service good (my daughter loved the popcorn).  We will certainly return.  Just ignore the tourists in the lobby although a group of Japanese tourists did get up to our floor one day and I had to battle through them after having had a massage to get back to my room.","4","2013-04"
"The worlds best hotel","Stayed at the hotel for 10 nights, wow what a trip, our second visit to the hotel, it's perfect in every way. It has to be the worlds best hotel, well located for the Wild Wadi, with complementary access for hotel guests, you can make use of he club cars for Transport. Pick up and drop off in the Rolls Royce is a magical touch.","5","2012-05"
"Burj Al Arab","What an experience. My favourite place in the whole world. The hotel is something to have been an honour to stay in.  I just love going back. The staff really know how to make a fuss of you and your own manager on the floor your room is on. As for your room you feel like a star or royalty. Took my son and daughter and they still go on about it. Each time I return to Dubai I have to go for a visit. It is a must. I love it so much.","5","2012-05"
"Not as good as it used to be","Firstly, on the plus side

Architecturally it's a marvel. It set new standards when it was built, and if you haven't been its well worth a visit , although the spectaculars of water and light shows seemed much less frequent than I remember from my first visit the month it opened.

However

It claims 7 star rating. The food is miles away from that level. At best it's an average food experience. Restaurant service in my case was very poor. The Burj charges 7 star prices, but doesn't deliver anything more than a 4 star experience.

When I stayed previously the accommodation and service were outstanding, I wouldn't stay now, as the large number of curious sightseers , does not lend itself to an exclusive and luxurious experience

There are much better places to stay in Dubai, and much much better food in dozens of restaurants","3","2013-04"
"Unique Hotel","This is the iconic Hotel in Dubai, great design and very very proffesional staff.  You can order a transfer from the airport.The reception was luxurious with marble and gold everywhere. The room was comfortable with details of interior everywhere. Loved the Hermes amenities.

The restaurant was amazing with the aquarium and breathtaking view of the fish and corals. The price is quite expensive but its worth visiting. After all, its a seven stars hotel. 

Breakfast was extensive with lots of choice from Western and Asian food. Great Hotel.","5","2013-03"
"The best hotel of this world","This is the best hotel I ever stay before in this world,everything is so beautiful,the restaurant,spa,the entrance,the fountain,the room.They call it the only seven stars hotel in the world.You can get a special  transfer from airport to hotel.you name it you get it.","5","2012-06"
"No More Than A Los Vegas Experience--Go There Instead!","As discerning travellers who have stayed at the best properties around the world, I can say with complete confidence that this was perhaps the most disappointing considering its notoriety. If this were located in Las Vegas and priced accordingly, I would say it's a kitsch, fun experience--go. However, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Dubai. To begin with, the best part of Burj Al Arab is admiring it from a distance. When there, one obviously does not have this vantage point and is left with a view that is far from remarkable. There is also an abundance of tourist day-tripper traffic that makes staying there feel like being at a crowded mall. Frankly, the interior is underwhelming and the grounds are the same. The pool is absurdly small, dated and placed in a location near outdoor restaurant dining. One would imagine Burj to have a extraordinary infinity pool with spectacular views. It does not. The conceirge service was the poorest I have ever encountered in a ""luxury property""--poorly informed and absurdly slow to respond. In fact, we also stayed at another Jumeirah property on our return from Oman, and found this to be the case as well. The breakfasts were horrendous--particularly considering their $100.00 buffet charge. Although there were three restaurants claiming to serve different food, in fact, they were pretty much the same. The choices were limited and were more appropriate for a lower-echelon chain-hotel.  Living in New York City, we are no strangers to excellent cuisine and have no problem with paying a considerable amount for a memorable meal. Burj's fish restaurant was memorable only for how terrible it was. To spend $1000.00 for two people, this should be amazing. It is not. The portions are tiny. The food itself is adequate. Only adequate. The aquarium was attractive but so is its counterpart in Disney World. An insulting rip-off, frankly. The duplex suites are indeed an experience. Well-appointed if Las Vegas kitsch-- with as many amenities as you can think of. If staying in your room 24/7 is an experience you fancy, this may be worth it. But to come here just to sleep--again, absurd considering the $2,000 cost. Overall, I can best see Burj on the Vegas strip, a property commensurate with MGM or Bellagio-- with a casino.","2","2013-01"
"The most amazing hotel in the world","We opted for the private beachfront setting. We ha our own table on the beach over looking the Burj al Arab. Gorgeous setting but the food was awful for what we paid, £180 excluding tip for 3 courses. £8 for a coke and they literally handed us the can with a straw! Glad I did it but it wasn't worth the money. The hotel only has a few rooms occupied each night so they seem to over charge in the restaurants to compensate this. ","5","2012-09"
"Truly Once (or Twice) in a Lifetime","I was shocked to see any ratings below 5 stars for Burj Al Arab.  But everyone has different tastes and it is definitely very expensive which might have been factored into those lower ratings.
   It is definitely something that you should do at least once in a lifetime, we have done it twice so far.
   The other reviews of this property say it probably better than me ... but it is a constant ""Wow"" experience.  The guest rooms are incredible - huge, more like a two-floor house with grand staircase.  The floor-to-high ceiling windows overlooking the water, etc.
   One of our favorites was the butler serving us breakfast in the morning - truly wonderful experience.","5","2013-01"
"Once in a life time","You will not belive the luxery in this hotel until you have been there. 
I dont have enough words too describe it. its nothing else than an amazing experience

Its superexpensive and we stayed here just one night.
But a have too say what a fabulos, magical and once in a life time experience.

If you have the money, just go for it. Stay at and other hotel, and take just one night here, my good its so extremely pretty!

Another tip is too order friday brunch at Al Muntaha.
You can preorder at Burj al arabs web side. (You can eat here even if you stay  in and other hotel in Dubai.)","5","2012-12"
"Everything You Expect And More !!!","This hotel is one of the most iconic buildings in the world. We came here to celebrate my fiancées birthday as a surprise and had contacted the hotel prior to arriving to make her birthday as special as possible. What we got and the way we were treated was above 1st Class. The private beach is immaculate with cool boxes supplied filled with ice and cool towels and bottles of cold water. Fresh cold water melon is brought to your sun lounger to help cool you from the Arabian heat. The golf carts take you from the beach back to the hotel. The Assawan Spa and Health Club is so relaxing with tranquil music piped as we had our Thai Massage with a view to die for. The Private use of the infinity pool on the 18th floor was amazing, views of Dubai and The Palm. Dinner in the restaurant is an experience not to forget with Chefs on hand to describe their creations with pride. First class service and a special surprise for the birthday girl! If you want to experience luxury and first class service then this hotel exceeds all expectations. Special thanks to the management and all the staff that made this a truly amazing holiday.","5","2013-03"

"I cant imagine more luxury place.","Me and my husband stayed there for 1 night only. Its an amazing place but too expensive to stay for whole holidays while u spending most of the time outside hotel. The best way is to take one night and stay for whole day inside using their luxury facilities. Everything is like in real Palace!!!! Normally we stay in 4-5 stars hotel so it felt really special. I loved pool and spa area. We took a massage for couples and to our surprise massage room was pretty dated. We couldnt use the Burj al Arab beach and water facilities:( It was closed we managed to check in on the only rainy day i a year in Dubai:((. The hotel is huge and they said it was full but it felt very quiet the corridors the pool they were hardly any people. I was a little bit disappointed with the hostess. They seemed to know that we arent billioners and they were giving us funny looks(we  werent drinking or doing weird things:)) I dont think it was appropriate for 7 stars standards. However the apartments whole architecture and atmophere can compensate us anything. We also went to Jansui and Al Irwan restaurants they were great and fairly cheap. After staying there we had a funny feeling that till the end of our lives we will be comparing every place in the world to this one and nothing can get any better...However we changed our mind quickly beacuse our next stop was Maldives:)))))","5","2013-01"
"Luxury with little service hiccups","First time in Dubai and the impressive landmark Burj Al Arab. Arrived at Dubai airport and were pickup by private transfer car to the hotel as requested. Car driver with flowers to my wife, inmaculate Mercedes Benzs and a nice short drive to the Burj. Arrived and we were greeted by name followed by a line of girls offering tea, dates and a cold towel, first impressions were above the normal welcome. Then, we were guided to our spacious two floor suite where we were greeted again by a butler and filleed all the check in papers. The room was spotless, very clean and opulent. Two floors of full luxury, with iMac desktop, flat tvs, Hermes amenities in bathrooms and one of the best beds in all our travels. Settled down and went to have dinner at the Al Iwan restaurant in the hotel for Arab buffet, which was excellent. Over the next 3 days, we were in and out of the hotel, everything under a planned schedule made in cordination with the hotel Concierges. Speaking of Concierges, there are two of them, full time on each floor, from a number of nationalities as far as Argentina or Sri Lanka. They are for the most part eager to help, but seemed overworked with many little things from other guest who requiered the minimum attention at all times. Here is Tip # 1, always double check everything you are told by the Concierges, we were giving wrong information pre arrival and during the stay. They have the best intention but they are quick to give you an answer which may not be true. Tip # 2 On the room, it seems the hotel lacks a procedure for housekeeping, as explained before, they are always ready remember your name, but they forget to bring ice and water to the rooms, towels or replace amenities in the bathroom, these on various occasions. The restaurants are nice, but extremely expensive, to the point to tell you its not worth it. Its not like you are dining with Beluga caviar and foie gras, I would say one its enough to say you dine in the hotel. Perhaps some of the locals dont care about money - its freeflows in Dubai - but we westerners do apreciatte our hard earned currency. Breakfast in the pool area is nice, best is the sense of peace by the scenery - turqouise sea, birds and breeze - excellent efficient servers and a good offering of food items from local camel milk to well prepared omelettes. Tip #3, DONT TRUST THE MARHABA airport transfer service, they were hired for us with confirmation to help us in the airport for the return flight and they misplaced our confirmed reservation. When they understood they mistake, they wanted to charge us double the confirmed rate and as a bonus for the worst service, they left us alone at Dubai airport not showing up as expected on our Meet and Greet service, avoid these people. 

Overall, our experience at the Burj Al Arab was good, many mistakes were made by the hotel - all over -, which were rapidly apologized for, but these I did not expect from a hotel that wants to be 7 Stars. I am also not mentioning here some other important mistakes about security and protocol. I would truly say they need to learn fro Four Seasons about complete excellence in service. The hotel is very very expensive and Im not really sure its worth it. But, if you have money to burn, its a one in a life experience you will remember.","4","2013-03"
"Sadly dissappointed","Our family of five stayed here  for 4 nights in a two bedroom suite  in  midJanuary. It was our 30th wedding aniversary. We had stayed several times previously but the last stay was 6 years ago. The 'children' are now young adults but were so looking forward to going back as they had such good memories of the Burj and the Wild Wadi and it was to be a special experience for us all. The advance purchase rate was AED 10,485+ 10 municipality fee and 10% service charge per night  (approx  AUS $3,300 per night) and on top of that they charged AED 1,500 + the 10% fee and 10% service charge per night (approx AUS $470 per night) to put a single bed downstairs for our son to sleep on.    Totally extravagant but we booked.  Note; the confirmation for our reservation was listed in my husbands name dispite the fact that I had made all the arrangements and payment.  We were also then informed that the Wild Wadi would be closed durning the time we were there.Noooo. How dissappointing
We arrived on the day of our wedding aniversary and had booked the Al Mahara restaurant for dinner. We had asked our 'butler' if he could iron some clothes for us for the evening but no,  one has to pay for a special ironing service.  They did however bring an iron and board to our suite so I could do it. Sounds good having your own butler but he does not do anything that the concierge at a good hotel would not do for you. The restaurant setting is wonderful with its glass wall and marine life and they had made a cake for us in celebration which was lovely. Service was good but the food was really nothing special so I guess one is really paying for the setting. 
Durning our previous stays the buffet breakfast was always in the plush top restaurant on one of the high floors overlooking the sea and the Palm.  This time it was on the ground floor by the pool..very ordinary setting and the buffet was .   
  Unbeknowns to us we had booked at the same time that 2 very large functions were being held at the Burj.  Access , both leaving and returning to the Burj was extremely time consuming and frustrating with all the traffic.   
To sum up we were very very dissappointed.  It fell far below our expections built up over our past experience staying there.If one is paying an extravagant amount of money to stay there then
you want a smooth positive and special experience.  It is sad that our past memories are now tarnished from our recent stay....if I could go back I would not have stayed there this last time.","3","2013-01"
"Worth a visit but butlers are annoying","Odd decor but impressive hotel despite the over eager and omnipresent staff. Our children (aged 9, 7 and 5 at the time) loved the hotel and the ""freebies"" that they were given. Access to wild wadi was good.

"four days at the Burj Al Arab","We flew from Heathrow airport on Emiirates and arrived at Dubai airpot, there was a private limozine waiting to whisk us away to the Burj al Arab. On arrival we aere presented with fresh dates and champagne.
Our two butlers one male and one female showed us to our two story apartment that included the biggest sitting room I have ever seen with a private office that included computer, fax, two telephones and personal stationary. The circular golden staircase led to an enormous bedroom with private suite , tv's and lounge areas. The bathroom of marble and gold plated fittings was again enormous and all the toiletries were D' Hermes. Our butlers were on hand for anything we needed. I t was the most luxurious hotel I have ever been to in my life and is a must for the kick the bucket list.","5","2012-05"
"Great place for solo Femmes  & its not that costly !","Business Season booms in march fr dubai & I happen to be there in Dubai and  booked my time at the Burj al Arab in Dubai having heard a lot of good things about it from my husband and my friends. I was traveling solo and as Dubai is generally considered safe for female travelers, It ws better to book a package & that’s why I booked from Dubaionsale.com – a good wholesaler for dubai packages.

I was prepared to take some risks and planned my outings accordingly keeping a few places as buffer in case I didn’t like the hotel. 

 My pickup from the airport was phenomenal as it was through a Rolls Royce Phantom and though the Travel agent paid for my chauffer but paying a little extra for this service is definitely worth it. I reached the Burj at the stroke of lunch and was immediately welcomed with an afternoon tea and the manager, who acted as a guide for my short stay. 

The manager escorted me to the restaurant premises and guided me through the various courses of buffet available. I sat on the extreme north east tables facing the expansive side of the large in-built aquarium and can tell that it had the best view. The rounded glass at the end of the colony distorted the vision from the tables nearby but was quite nice from my end. The lunch was heavy and the snacks spread of sandwiches, muffins, scones, fruits were readily available throughout the day as nonstop munching delights.

My waiter too was a polite and a genial gentleman. After my meal my impromptu guide took me on a short tour of the hotel and I was mesmerized by the beauty of all the sea view rooms and the great Helipad on the top floor. Thus such was the aura of the Burj Al Arab that I didn’t have to use my “buffer” back up options and I ended up spending the entire time in this awesome resort!! ","4","2013-03"
"Wow what a place!","Where to start! Hotel out of this world. Staff service incredible. Food amazing, especially the underwater restaurant which i forget the name of! Try the salted cod its fantastic. Views from the place unreal. Had one of the best massages ever and the spa is lovely. The sky bar was great fun, views at night fabulous. U must try the brunch as its great. Only thing i can provide a negative comment about would be that some of the sunbed umbrellas were looking a bit tatty and the pool and outdoor bar in general could do with a bit of a facelift and lacked a bit f atmosphere. But everything else aside from those small comments was amazing. Would love to go back... But will need to start saving again! You cannot be dissappointed with this place or its staff, it really is the best of the best.","5","2012-10"
"The hotel service is excellent","The hotel service is excellent, the view is spectacular especially the sky view bar and Al Mutaha restaurant. The staff are friendly and warm.

The hotel is clean and we shall love to come back.","5","2013-02"
"Burj Al Arab revisited","After some 15 stays at Burj Al Arab,  or so its been a year since my last review of this beautiful hotel which has drawn me back over and over agin over the years. Since that review, I had one more stay of 3 or 4 days with my family. There is no doubt that this is a staggeringly beautiful architectural splendor and the staff are impeccably trained, but I did notice a slide in the standards possibly due to the general economic recession of recent past years. The Burj needs to reinvent itself  slightly to keep regulars interested. I want to go back but Im afraid I might get bored so they need to up there standards and throw in the occasional Rolls ride etc to keep one interested. Its a very expensive place and I just feel that there should be something extra to keep regulars attracted. Possibly under previous managers, they were a bit more flexible and innovative, I used to feel inspired as every time I went to stay at Burj there was something special; a favorable rate or a great fuss over my daughters birthday or the free rolls royce ride. What management needs to  understand is that  luxury travellers aka - big money spenders keep on returning to get that once in a lifetime feeling. Initially, I always got that at Burj but in recent times its same same  and they are not quite so accommodating as they used to be. On my last stay 2012 I was unfortunate enough to get sick whilst eating in the Hotel.  Its one of those things that can happen anywhere, but I was too ill to board my flight and had to extend my stay by 2 days. I hadnt eaten outside of the hotel so I feel that they should have given me a much more favorable rate for the two extra sick days I had to spend there, Despite asking they kept the rate the same and I feel that in the interests of true customer service they should have been more accommodating.  When I flew 2 days later, I flew a long international flight still half sick simply because I was afraid of getting worse and the Burj expenses getting out of hand.  On my return I was still a bit upset about this so I cancelled my stay at Burj and went to Jabeel Saray instead, where I spent about a week. I don't know if I will go back to Burj Al Arab - maybe oneday but all Jumeirah properties are excellent and the Burj is outstanding in many ways. I think that I would have liked more communication from management when there and I wanted for Burj Al Arab to keep me interested in returning, I will always think of the Burj very fondly and recommend that all luxury travellers do this  hotel at least once.  Keep up the standard Burj al Arab, but go out of your way to retain your regular clients; you would be surprised how much revenue you can make from returning regular clients.","4","2012-08"
"Outdated, Over the Top, Intrusive, Rude & Expensive with No CLASS","We stayed at The Burj for 1 night simply to try it out.

Negatives about this hotel (there are many):

1 - Very ordinary buffet breakfast menu. Nothing special.
2 - Very Annoying & Intrusive ""Butler"" service. Each floor has a ""Butler"" who are assigned to watch and monitor your every move. We found this service to be very intrusive. Sometimes you want your privacy but in this hotel there is no privacy. 
3 - The technology in the room is very much outdated. There is nothing special that I can say we had never seen before. Upon check-in the butler was making a big deal out of the video-com and the fact that the suite had 16 telephones. We didn't find any of this overly exciting. Just over the top. 
4 - During this single day stay I can say that we had several issues with the attitude of the staff which wasn't expected from a ""7"" star hotel.
5 - In our room the shower was faulty and the floor of the shower was falling away from the drain which means that the water from the shower flows outwards!! They had HUGE towel like rugs to stop the water from running into the rooms but after a 20 minute shower in the master bathroom there was water all over our bathroom Everything was soaked. This was unacceptable in a ""7 star"" hotel. 
6 - They provided a $5 ""Complimentary"" bottle of wine. When you may >$1800 a night I did not expect this. I don't even know why the bothered with it. 
7 - The staff ask you what you need and when you tell them what you need they say ""yes sir, I'll get xxx (whatever it may be) for you shortly "" and then you never hear from them again. This happened to us on multiple occasions. 
8 - Expensive Expensive Expensive.

The good:

1 - We got a whole heap of Hermes amenities. Probably $3-400 worth but when you are paying >$1800 a night, this is kind of expected. 
2 - People in Dubai are crazy about the ""burj"" and everyone acts abit differently when they know you are staying at the ""burj"". It has to do with the materialistic nature of the country. 
3 - Brag Brag Brag

Conclusion:

If you have >$1mil in the bank go and try it for a night and tick it off your bucket list but if you have any sort of a budget for your holiday don't bother with this place. There are many other hotels that you can stay at which are far better. 

You can even stay at Al Qasr which is a sister property. You will get allot of amenities and have a better experience for a fraction of the cost of this place. 

PS: Don't expect high class guests at this hotel either. For some reason ""class"" seems to stay out of this hotel all together.","2","2013-01"
"Best hotel I've stayed at","I have read some bad reviews mostly from people who go there just to eat or have tea………but after staying at the hotel I can honestly say it was the best experience ever…….not a single complaint……the suite and bed are huge…food excellent….staff went out of their way to accommodate your every need……most definitely if you can afford it spend at least couple of nights there you will not regret it","5","2012-09"
"Next Level!","Stayed here for one night in September, 2010! We had a 2-bedroom suite as a family with the most amazing view, I swear everything here is Gold! Not how I would decorate my place but amazing nonetheless!!!

This hotel is truly breathtaking and something you have to cross off your bucket list! Service was out of this world, they make you feel like royalty from start to finish with in-room check in and check out! Each level has 2 butlers on call, I was shocked when I was heading back from the gym and had the butler glide past me, just to open the door for me. Now thats SERVICE!!!

I would return here in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone who likes living the highlife and can afford it... 5 days in the UAE was about 5 weeks in Europe!","5","2012-09"
"From here to the Burj Al Arab","Another Xmas spent in the splendour of this exquisite hotel. Greeted by the best doormen ever who now know have become friends. As they say first impressions.....Another stunning Panaramic suite at the corners of the hotel give you views two ways so you can see for miles each way. Had a great massage but not in the usual room which has stunning views so a little disappointed. However great massage. The food in the hotel is outstanding and wonderful Xmas Dinner by the fab chef Mohammed and his team - thank you all. The beach bar is another of our favourite places and a great welcome by all especially Satish and Carlos who however busy ( and they were) manage to spend sometime with us. The pool area suits us as not too big and again looked after very well. We had friends who came to visit and they were blown away by the hotel and our butler did a great job making them feel welcome. The unpacking service and packing has to been done once...boy what a treat😜😜😜well we have booked again for May- thanks Nimal yet again..","5","2012-12"
"A one off life experience","Spent a week in Dubai with our final night in the Burj to celebrate my 50th. The rooms are like no other I have seen. Pampering from the moment you arrive in the hotel, treats and nibbles throughout the day, whether on the beech or in your room. There is even a bed menu. Yes it’s expensive but it’s the whole experience you are paying for, not just a stunning double floor suite with guest bathroom, office, dining area, lounge area, massive bedroom, change area and a massive bathroom. The views from the lounge and bedroom are amazing. The staff made my 50th a day and evening I will never forget. I will not spoil it by giving details but it was un expected and memorable. Our butler (yes you get a butler) took us to the 24th floor to look down through the stunning building but were stopped by the staff on that level. On returning to change we were met with an apology and not only did we get to see the view but also got a tour of one of the rooms on that level and a viewing of a family suite, all are of the same amazing standard . From other reviews and from experience I think you have to stay to get the full experience, window views and pool side seats were never an issue for us.","5","2013-03"
"Simply the best experience","What can I say it's the Burj Al Arab! You pay a lot and get a lot! 2bdr was huge with all the hermes amenities worth about $1000. Little things like forgetting the newspaper in the morning were quickly made up for by a nice gift basket of champagne, figs, flowers and great souvenir book of the hotel plus an upgrade at the executive towers hotel. Breakfast & dinner great. Spa amazing! Pick up service so personal, with a bouquet of roses for me & my daughter. Chairs by the beach were already prepared  for us only because we walked out of the hotel in swimming costumes, now that's service! however, the pool bar needs urgent attention!!!","5","2012-06"
"Wow!","Oh my God, where to start? The burj al arab is an experience so different and so unique, nothing like we'd ever had before. The hotel is amazing, the suites are 2 floors, with an office, dining room, multiple sitting rooms, huge bathroom, walk in closet, etc. The service is impecable, the amenities are awesome. If you can afford to splurge, it is definitely worth it. We stayed in another hotel in dubai for the first 2 nights and then another 2 nights in the burj, and our conclusion was: first we went to dubai and then we went to the burj al arab. Loved it!","5","2013-02"
"Simply the best","It's a must to visit and a desire to stay. I was lucky enough to be there for 3 days. It is just simply amazing. The architecture is awesome and every room has it's own butler! The service is faultless as you would expect from such an establishment but everything is just that little bit extra, from the projection clock on the wall of the staircase in your room, which, of course, is a duplex suite, to the bed pillow menu and the superb toiletries in the gargantuan bathrooms. This is a place to splurge for that special occasion. Try to watch the fountain display on the mezzanine floor, it's amazing.","5","2012-04"
"The best. Period.","I stayed at the hotel for 1 night.  It was really amazing. The hotel is kept in immaculate shape, it's design is stunning, the rooms are Huge and well appointed (stayed in the panoramic suite). And the service is best I've had. Restaurants are awesome. Can't say anything bad about the place.  I suggest upgrading to the panoramic suite or a couple hundred dollars more.  Well worth it.  Also go for afternoon high tea in the lobby floor it's great. 
If you enjoy staying in hotels then this Should be on your bucket list. 
I'm not wealthy so the price was a bit of a deterrent but after staying here and understanding the experience that you get I think it's worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again for a special occasion (special family holiday, romantic getaway, honeymoon etc). ","5","2013-02"
"wow","Everyone should live like a princess once in their lifetime; that I did when I stayed at the Burj.  I have never seen such opulence, been served so luxuriously, in my life.  from the butler with the room who turns on your bath, plays sensual music and brings you figs, to the Evian filled water bottles brought to you on the beach to spray on your body to cool off.  wonderful, wonderful wonderful.","5","2012-04"
"An experience of Life Time","When we planned to have a holiday in Dubai, we decided to stay one night at the Burj Al Arab. We took a Taxi from the Deira Area and headed to the hotel. Once our name was given to the Gate Security we were promptly received upon arrival. We were treated like a King. from the arrival till we checked out the following day.

The Room! it was awesome, the decor the setup and the floor butlers. Everytime you leave the room and return, the floor butlers recognise you and open the door to your room. We really enjoyed our One Day stay. Definately could not afford a second night.

But our next visit to Dubai, this is defianetly in our planning and budget. a special Thanks to Royston and his team, they were very helpful and guided us well. We planned our next few night stay activities as recommended by Royston. We wanted to eat at an Indian restaurant nearby, his team guys brought us there and even walked us to the Restaurant and opened the door at the restaurant and greeted us to Enjoy Our Lunch and please call me when you are finished and we will pick all of us up in the buggy later. Thanks Again to Royston and his Team.

If you visit Dubai, Please do not miss this Hotel. Cheers!!!!","5","2013-02"
"Look for details , you would be surprised","Firstly the experience itself of staying at the honeymoon suite in probably the best luxury hotel of the world was breathtaking and got us excited .We booked our honeymoon in Dubai through the Dubaionsale.com ,they booked a complete stay,sightseeing etc for 2 of us at decent rates to this costly property

We were greeted by the manager who took us to our rooms. While going to our room we saw that the hotel was located on a ground layer of bulky rocks which was then circled with a solid honeycomb mould. This looked slightly queer and when I asked the butler about the same, he replied nonchalantly that the same has been done to protect the foundation of the resort from erosion. Thus we could help being amazed at the level of details the world’s 4th largest hotel had envisaged.

Our club like suite was around 700 sqft in area and had all state of the art amenities like LED TV, electronic safe, butlers at the push of a button and what not. The Kashmiri carpet complimented the color of the wall perfectly. The bathroom consisted of a huge bathtub, curling irons and hair straightner. The toiletries were all branded and were replaced every day. The head and shoulder massage available along with the blow wave should also be experienced.

During our afternoon tea, we got a view of the 590 ft tall atrium and the panoramic elevator. Given the standards the Burj had set for itself till then, the wide variety of teas in the tea menu came as no surprise but how quickly it was served was!! Moreover served in ancient bone china cups my wife felt like a queen. Thus we had a truly amazing honeymoon.","4","2013-02"
"A once in a lifetime experience...","An amazing experience if you have the money to spare. Very very expensive place but you are truly treated like a VIP once you are in. Complimentary Rolls Royce airport pick-up was a bonus. We were checked in directly into our room on arrival and showed around by our private butler. The staff remembered our names in different restaurants despite our brief stopover for two nights. Food was good but the variety could have been better for such a luxurious hotel. Our hotel room was spread across two floors and was unbelievably luxurious. I would recommend going here at least once just to experience the amazing environment.

We travelled in February 2012.","5","2012-03"
"Ultimate Luxury","A brief trip to Dubai with just one night at the Burj. This hotel is absolutely incredible... magnificent in fact. The sail design is remarkable and whilst I had seen images to see it for myself left me speechless. The service as you would expect was impeccable and suites luxuriously appointed with the finest amenities. I can't recall when I have slept so well! I was unable to have dinner at the hotel however I have definitely added that to my bucket list. In my view there is no hotel in the world that compares to this one. It is worth a visit even if you can't stay!","5","2013-02"
"amazing","absolutely fantastic. We stayed in the hotel and it was flawless. Everything was perfect, from the butler to the room to the practically empty beach. You really are treated like royalty, and this is luxury at it's finest. The high tea is also exceptional and delicious, and the views are incredible. Can't say enough wonderful things.","5","2013-01"
"Absolutely fantastic hotel","On arrival we had lovely drinks with ice in. The hotel building was absolutely fantastic. The rooms was fantastic and very clean with an aircon system to cool you down. I had a very good sleep. The breakfast was excellent. The hotel was in a Excellent location very near the sea. The service was brilliant.","5","2012-07"
"Spectacular","well worth the price, it was amazing from start to finish.  You get your moneys worth here .  we had a two bedroom room and it was big enough for ten people to stay.  staff a bit slow at pool but to be honest the overall experience compensated for this.","5",
"pure luxury","i was lucky enough to be surprised enroute to my  honeymoon with a 2 night stay at the burj from the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty from the welcome in the lobby to the concierge outside the suite the service during our stay was impeccable i don't even think we opened our own door once. being on honeymoon we where treated to cakes and flowers and the food in the restaurants is outstanding and would definitely recommend trying the Al Mahara which is set in a beautiful aquarium . the suite itself is opulent and extravagant and the view over the palm is amazing from the full length windows.if you have the chance to visit this amazing hotel do it its is just pure luxury !!","5","2012-09"
"Opulence and splendour , the ideal honeymoon destination","Out of this world elegance, opulence and splendour. We where picked up by the driver who presented me with a bouquet and the obligatory cold towels and bottled water.pleasent journey. Treated like nobility from stepping out the car, greeted by name and given more cold towels and Arabic delicacies, shown thru lobby and up to our duplex suite on the 15th floor, met by concierge team who couldn't do enough for us. As a graduate of the world renowned scottish hotel school it was great to see these luxury standards in practice. The room was out of this world, very regal and the view was amazing. Fresh flowers everywhere and lovely baklava and dates. We opted for a succinct version of the room orientation. Couldn't believe you can open you door from the remote control ha ha. Full size apple pc with free Internet usage. We couldn't get the iPod dock to work, but our butler chris was great and improvised with other leads. Honestly, the staff could not have been any more attentive. Spa was amazing. Couples treatment with a view over the sea was great. The spa was so peaceful and tranquil, the pool with panoramic views will never be forgotten. In room dinning was like that of Michelin star restaurant. During our stay as honeymooners we received various cakes, flowers and drinks and to top it off personalised towels to take home. On leaving we told our head concierge Mahmood that we unfortunately could not gain access to the sky bar on the Friday night, and he swiftly organised a private viewing before our departure, which added to our experience. On leaving we received the same driver Nasir, don't know if this was coincidence or continuity. It's a place everyone should try and do even once. Out of this world.","5","2013-02"
"Wonderful building","Many stars for this hotel. Terrific landscape view from penthouse. Extremely fast elevators, they transfer you 50 floors in a few seconds.There were perfumes and body lotions in public toilets ! ! ! Very expensive gourme restaurant in the penthouse, we had lunch there.","5","2012-10"
"Unique experience","Stayed at the Burj Al Arab to celebrate my 24th birthday. We booked a Club Suite ( 1908 ) 19th floor. 

I can write a book about the Burj Al Arab, but the Burj can not been told in words. You must see it with your own eyes and experience it by yourself. The Burj Al Arab is unique in every way.  

The butlers are fantastic especially Shakeel and Robert they were so friendly and helpful nothing was to much for them. Thank you very much!

In my opinion the only negative point about the hotel is that they allow so many busses full of tourist. The lobby area somethings looks like the grand bazaar in Istanbul! 

Will we come back to the Burj Al Arab?

DEFINITELY !!!","5","2013-01"
"Got Lucky to afford it: wud remember forever","Standing on an artificial island at a distance of around 1000 ft from the famous Jumeirah Beach and connected to the main island via a private curving bridge, the Burj Al Arab was undoubtedly the best resort we had ever stayed in. Promoted as the world’s only “seven – star” resort, the shape of the formation from the onset gives the feel of a ship. Dubaionsale.com helped us (me and my girlfriend) get a room in this 202 bedroom mega suite hotel in this 28 storied building at a great 25% discount thru some offer and it wasn’t as costly trip as I expected

	A butler was waiting for us with a welcome drink and what not at the entrance. Excellent staff with impeccable service ensured a brilliant entry and they were ready to go to any extent to help us. As we moved into our rooms my wife’s eyes went to the bathroom immediately. She remarked that all products in the bathroom were of the prestigious Hermes brand and an unbelievably good décor. The lighting suited our mood to the tee. As we checked into our suite in the evening we found a surprise gift wrapped in our bed. It was a box of goodies including branded men and women perfumes, chocolates and wrapped towels. 

The Al Mahara literally meaning - The Oyster is the restaurant there and is a gourmet’s delight. The commute to the place is no less an experience with it being accessed by means of a virtual submarine passage and crossing a large sea water aquarium on the route. The food is truly out of this world with an array of dishes being accessible from throughout the globe including exotic dishes like the boiled walrus blubber. The breakfast buffet was replenished spontaneously keeping it overwhelmingly fresh. 

All in all the suites and the views over Dubai are exquisite and gives u a true global experience.","4","2013-01"
"Beautiful Hotel, but...","...to me it is inconceivable that this hotel does not offer a more acessible way for a tourist to visit its premisses, other than the USD 300 for the Tea Room or USD 500+ for one of its restaurants, and even this way they require a reservation in advance. Sure, we all know it is one of the most expensive hotels in the world, but one does not get the same treatment when visiting the Bellagio in Las Vegas. On top of that the staff working at the gates is extremely rude, be it at giving any kind of information or shooing those who, frustrated of not having a chance to enter just to admire the structure a bit closer, attempt to snap a photo by the outer gates. They really should train those people better! ","3","2012-02"
"Spectacular!","I believe this hotel is the Most Luxurious hotel I've ever seen and been! Great service. Lovely staff. Extremely excellent! Will surely come back again. And I took pictures like I've never come back anymore! Awesome! Spectacular..","5","2013-01"
"Very special experience - one and only","We stayed 2 nights at the Burj during our recent Dubai visit.  A lot has been said about this hotel already.  I just want to conclude that
- all the staff are very services orientated, nothing is of any troubles. There's always a smile on their face.
- the decors may not be to everyone's taste.  But hey, this is Dubai.
- the indoor pools are rather small.  You won't feel comfortable doing laps if there're 3 more persons in the pool.  Didn't try the out door pool as its too cold this time of the year.  The shower and sauna area are very nice. The water temperature is lovely, heated somewhat.
- our room on 16th floor facing the Palm.  The view is magnificent. 
Overall, if you can afford it, do it.  It's an experience you probably won't find it anywhere else.","5","2013-01"
"Even better than a dream","This was the most extraordinary hotel I ever went to. The service is personnalised, all your requests are answered and the buttler as well as the entire hotel's team are very nice. We tried 4 different restaurants and all were very fine - the best one being the Al Mahara. Of course, the prices are expensive, but when you go to the only 7 stars in the world, you don't consider the prices. We enjoyed the swimming pool and all the great attentions from the staff when you're just taking the sun. We went for 2 superb massages and spent some monney in the shops.
This was an unique experience and a fantastic gift for my loved one.","5","2012-11"
"FANTASTIC BURJ AL ARAB","Unique setting of rooms, great staff, fantastic sea view, amazing buffet and a great escape!
I really enjoyed my Trip with Friends. It was really wonderful beyond the words to say. I feel to say at least once in a life time to visit this great 7 star hotel.","4","2012-05"
"Xmas eve extravagance","Well from arriving at the drive up until we left nothing was too much trouble for the staff of the Burj Al Arab.
We had our own check in on our floor, the butler explained everything in the suite perfectly. Wherever we went in the hotel we were greeted by name. 
Such a wonderful experience to see staff that enjoy being there to make everything perfect for the guest.
Toiletries to bed turning perfect. We will return to stay again.","5","2012-12"
"Beautiful hotel and location","This is beautiful hotel.  Overlooks the ocean and has a very unique shape.

Rooms are perfect in every single shape and form.  Restaurant serves delicious food and is sticking out from the side of the hotel.

If you are ever in Dubai, you must stay at this hotel as it will surpass all of your expectations.","5","2012-12"
"Oozing exclusivity","Spending five nights in the Burj al Arab was a once in a lifetime experience. Nothing was too much trouble from the moment we arrived. Our butler, Anna, was helpful and charming and sourced lemon and honey for my sore throat. Complimentary flowers, local sweets and wine arrived in our suite and little gifts appeared at our bedside every evening. My husband particularly enjoyed his cuticle cream! The Hermes toiletries in the bathroom were a luxurious treat, especially the foaming bath tablets. We were spoilt for space in our suite and it was a peaceful haven once we had dodged through the numerous tourists taking photographs in the lobby. Breakfast was very good but apart from room service on our first night, we didn't eat in the hotel. The gym and spa on the 18th floor were beautiful and you must visit the swimming pool there. The infinity edge stretches up close to the glass and the view is amazing. The buggies to the beach were plentiful and we never had to wait - although I know that is not always the case at peak times. On one negative note, had we been travelling with our children they would have been very disappointed that the Wild Wadi Waterpark was closed for 2 weeks. We were not informed of this prior to our arrival also we were only told on the day of our arrival that the outdoor pool was unavailable. This left us only with the beach which we were happy with but families may not have been. All in all a wonderful exclusive break but perhaps more suited to couples than families. When travelling with our family we will continue to use the other superb Jumeirah hotels - Jumeirah Beach and Mina a'Salam.","5","2013-01"
"Incredible treat for a couple with loads of money","We stayed at the Burj last December after wanting to see what all the fuss was about with a 7* hotel status, although i still don't see how you can get 7 out of 5, but either way it was an incredible experience.

Pros:

Incredible rooms, with a double story set up with over 100 light bulbs per suite to provide mood lighting etc. 
Enormous elaborate lounge and bedroom with a rather suggestible mirror on the ceiling.
9/10 exceptional staff (one was a little keen on checking her mobile phone, but maybe I'm being pedantic?)
The food bought to the room and welcome drinks were a lovely touch
The sky lounge cocktail bar is worth a visit but with a minimum spend, it was a little cheeky, although as you could imagine in the Burj it didn't take long to spend the said minimum!
The adjacent water park was fun and provided a healthy rest bite from the air of protentiousness and OTT ambiance of the Burj.
Best breakfast I've ever had in my life and worth having it prepared in your room.
Loads of freebies to take home from the suite which made for a nice touch.

Negatives:
Bloomin' expensive, but on reflection worth it for a one night treat. I think if i was super minted I still wouldn't want to stay more than a night as it is quite an intense experience.
The remote control to activate and work the sound, lights, TV etc was excessively confusing and too much hassle. I want to relax and enjoy not remember shed loads of instructions.

It's a real experience and nothing is too much hassle to please you the indulgent guest, but I wouldn't go back, I'd try something else. Still say it's the best hotel I've been to and I'm extremely glad I went.","5","2012-12"
"Amazing Hotel","Stayed for 3 nights in 2012, mercedes transfer from the airport to hotel which is very nice, for an extra 500 you can have a rolls royce. The hotel has a lounge style setup in the airport where you can check in to the hotel and have refreshments while you wait for your driver. Very professional and have not seen this anywhere else. The hotel is amazing and the service impeccable at every turn as others have mentioned. On its own island with gated entry you feel very priveleged and exclusive. Ferraris out front a nice touch for the car enthusiast in me :)

The pool at the top of the hotel has amazing views, everytime we went up there we had the place to ourselves, its a must do.
I even went and had a haircut at the salon up there and without a booking they took me in even though they were taking photos of models for a magazine!! I enjoyed that view, wife didnt :)
This hotel is one of the best you will ever stay at it only loses one mark for value as some of the drinks were really expensive (tax) but then again if you can afford to stay at here you can afford the drinks.

We were upgraded to a bigger a room (its huge) and its floor to ceiling windows offer amazing views of the city, haze permitting. Spread over 2 levels im sure there were parts of it we never discovered. The rooms are of a decadance some will never experience, even if some say they are dated.

A must visit once in your lifetime.","5","2012-05"
"A bit disappointing.","My friend(who is a girl) and I came to Dubai mainly because we wanted to check out how good Burj Al Arab was. We are staying in this hotel now but there were many things which pissed us off today.

First, the check in part. Our tour guide requested for an early check in at 1:30pm and he got a confirmation from this hotel. We were on a tour of around 8 people on the shuttle bus waiting at the hotel entrance at 1:45pm but the hotel didn't let us in because they said the group check in time is 3pm. My friend and I booked a table in Al Mahara for 2 at 2pm. The delay of my check in time made us very annoyed since we were expecting to have lunch but then we needed to wait outside the gate. What a warm welcome from a so called 7 stars hotel! 

The lunch was alright, the fish tank was fantastic and food is quite good. The service is that good at all, the service you get from Shangri-la, four season or Mandarin hotel is a lot better than this.

After lunch, we went to our suite for check in, suite is spacious, and the decor is exquisite. The view from the hotel was marvelous as we can see the ocean from the window. There was a lady who helped us with the check in the room. and the check in part is alright, at least she tried to wear a smile on her face. We were told that there will be someone who was going to give us a brief intro about the room, we have waited for about 25 mins but no one came. Later a male staff Joseph came into our room and promised he would change the amenity set from male to female and he asked us whether we are in a hurry or not, we thought he asked this because he was worried that we didn't have too much time for him. So I told him, no we are not and we were expecting him to tell us all then important information about the room.We asked him if we could have a spare box of chocolate and postcard. Ironically, his answer was""okay, if you are not in a hurry, I will come back later"" and he left without telling us what he is engaging in and how long it takes him to come back. I don't know why it took him so long though. 

After 10 minutes Joseph came back he brought us two glasses of welcome drink, it's a very nice drink. But the guy did not bring us the confectionary or postcard. Nor could he remembered we have asked this questions. The brief introduction was so brief that it only takes less than 3 minutes and the toilet amenity set is not correct and he didn't even notice until we reassure him no one came to change the amenity set. We told Joseph that the size of the slippers were not correct as one of it is size 44 and the other 41. Both are way too big for ladies. We asked for size 37. And finally we get size 39 which is not correct. The amenity took ages to be changed. They didn't give a set of shampoo and shower gel for two people and we had to called the housekeeping and asked for it. It's very very inefficient for a hotel to run like this, we needed to call for more than 4 times in total in 2 hours to urge them to make up what is not good. 

We requested for buggy service with Joseph, and he told us buggy is ready and we could go down and take it to the canal. We went downstairs straightaway, the buggy didn't show up. We spoke to the Door guy Valentine and asked about the status of the buggy and he didn't have a clue, he told us he will arrange another buggy but we still have to wait for more than 10 minutes for it. There are not enough buggies in the hotel area as it is even harder to catch a buggy in another area of Jumeriah resort. One thing which delighted us was the buggy guy Mr HASAN, he is from Bangladesh and he was very helpful and kind to take us around the resort area.

Overall this hotel is good, the room is comfy. There is stint in the coffee making bottle, and quite a lot dust on the cupboard. 

This hotel could be much better if it is more efficient, and if in-room service staff were more well trained. It's not only about the room size or the decor in the room a traveller looks for, a good hotel should be somewhere which makes us feel like going home.","3","2013-01"
"Once in a lifetime experience!","I travelled to Dubai of July 2012 with my Partner. We had originally booked to stop in the one and only the palm but after a issue with our booking we decided to move to the Burj. Our travel advisor called the Burj direct and arranged for us to check into the hotel. With just 3 hours notice they had a room available for us and even arranged for a car to collect us from the one and only.

We stayed in the club suite which was absolutely fantastic, i would even say it was too big for the both of us however the space wasn't wasted nor overwhelming for us. We had our own snooker table which my partner ensured he took advantage off, as well as our own private bar, dining area, and two seating areas. Upon our arrival we was greeted and taken straight to our room where was introduced to our floor butler. We was spoilt with a cocktail of our choice and fresh fruit which was a nice touch after travelling for hours. Our room had panoramic views of the Jumeirah hotel, the beach, and the surrounding gulf. Which was great, as one evening we was politely informed by our butler as well as a letter to our room informing us the sheikh was having a private party on the beach and there would be fireworks. We felt even more special to have a perfect view of a spectacular firework display! We was not disturbed by this at all. The room was sparkling clean and cleaned daily. We had a pillow menu, and my partner made a request for a hard pillow and this was quickly done. Every afternoon we got back to our room we was surprised by little nibbles and snacks. The decor of the rooms and the hotel is very grand but you get what you pay for if not beyond. We was supplied daily with hermes toiletries which goes to show what luxury you are staying in.

The staff around the hotel were more than helpful. Our butler kindly gave us a list of recommended restaurants that was very helpful. we decided to book a few and they kindly took care of these request. They arranged cars for us, and made bookings of any excursions we wished to do. Nothing could be faulted, we was spoilt for choice! I would recommend to swim with the dolphins at the atlantis! This is great for all ages, and me and my partner both enjoyed meeting ""Dinita"" the dolphin we swam with! Myself even took advantage of the hairdressing salon at the burj and it is to be one of the best blow drys i had. I would also go and have cocktails in one of the highest bar in the world in the burj khalifa there is a great ambience and spectacular views. 

As the burj is part of the jumeirah group, we was able to take advantage of the madinat jumeirah which boasted even more hotels, bars, and shops. This was great on evenings when we didn't want to venture to far. Theres buggies always available, and we found when we mentioned we was going to the Burj service was even quicker, we didn't have to wait long for a buggy.
 
Our last 4 days of our stay Ramadan started. This did not affect anything at all, everything was still the same. We still could eat, drink, and go about our fantastic holiday as we wanted. However we did take into consideration it was Ramadan and out of respect i did take a shawl out with me on a evening to cover up more. However this wasn't asked of me, and other women around the hotel still wore what they wished. if you are to travel to the Burj or dubai around Ramadan i would not let it bother your holiday at all, it didn't to ours. The only obvious change was we had booked afternoon tea, and rather it be on the 1st floor it was moved to the ball room. This wasn't a issue for us, if anything we got to enjoy the great views of dubai as was so high up. The Burj is truly a remarkable building and design. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday here, i have nothing to fault. it is definitely a once in a lifetime experience staying at the Burj, the service was truly spectacular. We have previously stayed at the Atlantis, One and Only the Palm, Westin and La Meridian and the Burj has to be our best hotel in dubai to date.","5","2012-07"
"Luxury and Excess personified....","My girlfriend and I stayed at the hotel as a stop off on way home to uk for 2 nights in a Panoramic suite on the 12th floor.  We had previously stayed at the Raffles hotel which we found was excellent and so we expected great things from the Burj and on the whole we were not disapointed.

The Good:

-The building itself certainly has the wow factor and it is a marvel.
- You are made to feel very special in this place and the service cannot be faulted, staff members rush to open doors for you and the butler is very helpful.
- The Panoramic suites are huge and peaceful and have more amenities than you will ever need.  The decor is an acquired taste to be honest but fits in with the OTT nature of hotel and so is abit of fun
- The Hermes bath products and gillete razors and gel and the night time gifts are excellent touches and help to justify the price 

Areas to improve:

- The drinks/snacks in minibar are all chargable which is slightly dissapointing at this price point
- We had the breakfast buffet at Al Iwan and the choices were quite limited with not enough freshly cooked dishes for a 5* hotel.
- There are many visitors who are non resident to the hotel which is obviously going to happen in a hotel of this calibre.  However it means that the entrance is very busy and made it very tiresome to get taxis - and the process took alot longer than it needed to.  
- The Al Mahara restaurant was disapointing - the setting an ambience great but the food was disappointing.  At this price point you expect to be blown away but the food was lacking.  We would recomment going outside the hotel for restaurants such as Reflets and Indigo which were far better IMO and less expensive too!  The Ossiano restaurant in Atlantis has a more impressive aquarium if that attracts.

We felt the burj is an amazing place - yes it is over the top and sometimes it isnt very tasteful however we throughly enjoyed our stay.  Would we come back? probably not we just went to see what was like but at this price point there are many hotels which offer service just as good like the Raffles where we stayed last time.  That said, the place is amazing and does make you feel very special indeed and is well worth the trip at least once!","5","2012-10"
"More than Expectations","No matter what we expected from the only seven star hotel in the world, our visit was 
far greater than what we expected. Rooms are just a amazing, but the best part of 
the hotel is the fantastic service. I don't know how they seem to know what you want
or need before you want it, but within just a minute or less after you ask for something,
an expert arrives and helps you. To do this without it seeming like they are hanging
on your elbow is perplexing.Totally private, but instant service.","5","2012-07"
"Magestic. Whorthy to visit, if you can...","The time you enter the gates to the Burj al arab, you already experience a strange feeling of ultimate luxury. The entrance is magnificent, the different rooms and restaurants are a must and people/personnel are very friendly and make you feel comfortable and well treated. The best thing is space, a lot of space everywhere in and outside the rooms, and ultimate decoration. Rooms are from deluxe suite to royal suite according to your pocket, but all of them full of luxury and royal treatments. Prices are very high, but if you are tempted to do a one in a life expensive and luxury experience you can look for one day package or weekend packages. If you do not want to stay at the hotel, you can book a tour and afternoon tea (around 100 usd) or dinner package that can cost around 200 usd and that will also aloud you free access to other surprising and luxury experience (a private and free small baggie, will take you to other attraction around the burj al, like the must to see Jumeirah beach hotel and restaurant /pubs, or to the elegant laid-back terrace bar in the middle of the ocean the 360º Bar (where you can drink, dance and chat around, most of times wealthy and reach people from different countries).  At the burj al you can also go to skyview bar suspended 200 meters above sea level where you need to dress smart casual and the minimum to expend is around 80 usd. 
Like I said it’s a worthy experience….","5","2012-11"
"Worth it","Once you stay there, you will not want to stay anywhere else. Service is excellent.
We stayed for a long weekend and enjoyed most of all the secludedness of the resort. Sometimes it is a bit of a pain to see sightseers in the lobby taking pictures, but generally one is quite secluded. Shisha corner at the beach is the best place to relax.","5","2012-05"
"Best Hotel Stay Ever","The only downside was we could only stay for one night. Panoramic suite with amazing views of Dubai. Massive room, massively over the top and superbly gaudy. Everything is gold and royal blue but of the highest quality and just adds to the decadent feel of the whole stay. From the complimentary wine and Hermes products (eau de toilette, shaving cream, moisturiser, shower gel etc) to the free mixed drinks in the room by the butler it was amazing. 18th floor infinity pool was a great way to relax with the view over Dubai. The room is simply faultless and impressive. Couple that with a wonderful dinner on the 25th floor and the amazing Hassen who made is feel very welcome, add in cocktail waiters who will make any cocktail you want it just makes you feel very special.

But there's more. The pool area is great, a tad small but then there aren't masses of people staying here. Lovely sea view and lots of people making sure you are happy. From altering you seat height to cleaning your sunglasses for you (seriously!) 

All in all I really can't see why anyone wouldn't say this hotel isn't anything but superb. Can't wait for our next visit.

Thanks to Jari and all his staff.","5","2013-01"
"Offers more than money can buy!","By far this has been the most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in. The service in absolutely perfect: 24/7 butler service, amazing food and in room dining and not to mention the very exquisite view. If you are willing to pay for a few nights of total and unbelievable luxury, this is the place to go to!","5","2013-01"

"Just Do It--Once.  Once is enough","In Dubai a gleaning pleasure dome arose.  We used our flyer miles to go to Dubai.  I don’t think I would pay to go there.  Its nice, but way way way down the list.  With a free flicht we decided to stay two nights and stay at the Burj (that’s what those of us who have been there call it :-))  There is really not a lot to do at Dubai.  They have a great mall, but so does Costa Mesa.  You can see the gold souk, go down the waterslide, ride the monorail and see the fountains and see the worlds tallest building in one day.  Then your just waiting to go home.

OK, Now that I have established that we are crazy, on to the hotel.  We used the fine resorts and hotels from Amex sw we got the free breakfast and a room upgrade.  Breakfast in the room was $ 120.00 each and the upgrade was $2,000.00 so thank you Amex, you paid for your card fee for the next decade.  The hotel was splendid, just like everyone says.  Breakfast was served by the butler and an assistant to work the toaster.  I felt so guilty I ate carbs.  It was nice to live like the rich and famous, but as much as I like roomservice where they set-up and go, I cant watch another person be my toaster-jocky.  Once was enough and we went to the Japaneese Buffet for Japaneese breakfast the next day (there is an European breakfast buffet as well, but I get that all the time).  

EVERYONE knows your name.  You get into the water park for free AND can cut the lines.  When you go to the beach they bring you a cooler with water, misters and cold towels.  There is a linen and pillow menu from which you can order.  When you walk through the hotel in the early morning the cleaners stop cleaning and stand at attention in present vacuum-cleaner until you pass by.  I read they have no tipping, but there was a 10% suggested gratuity added to the bill–relieved a lot of stress.

You can rent a hotel room like this in New York or Las Vegas for $ 10,000.00 a day.  Try it once and see if this is the life for you.  It is not for me, but two days of it made a wonderful memory at what is comparably a good deal.","5","2012-09"
"Unbelievable !!!! rolls Royce phantom pick up from airport.","Inc readable hotel.
The rooms are incredible , massive.
The butler was lovely.
The service is great.
The duplex suite is bigger than my home.
Take your own champagne as drinks are obscenely expensive.
I have never seen opulence like this it borders on garish.
Wow if you can afford it, do it.
We  ate in both restaurants and they were both rubbish and at £900 for 6 people in each crazy money.
They were pretty but the food was poor and too expensive.
Only complaint is the price of food and drinks.
The roller was brilliant.","5","2012-02"
"amazing as always","not disappointed by our 2nd visit to a great hotel. Service great, staff great, the views amazing from all angles. Breakfast in the pool restaurant has some of the best breakfast views I've seen.   If you're thinking of visiting as a resident, stop thinking and book.  There were more kids at the hotel this time due to the time of year due to the holidays but still nice and relaxing.  NOt the best place for kids, particularly teen agers as its nice and quiet, but you are right next to the shopping and wild waddy water park so lots to keep them happy too.","5","2012-12"
"Beautiful Hotel and Attentive Service, But ....","We stayed in this beautiful hotel over the New Year for 6 days.  The accommodation is wonderful and we found the service very attentive.  We loved all the little touches with the Hermes products, although they did get a bit samey, the food was excellent, the staff were always chatty, and the Butler Service is nice, if you like being walked to your room, but sometimes hit and miss with confirmation of reservations.  The pool area is a little disappointing, but up until this point, we would say we had a fabulous holiday.

And then New Years Eve celebrations arrived.  As tickets cost more than £1,200 each for the three of us, we had expected an amazing event.  Unfortunately we found the whole evening disappointing.  We eat in the Ball Room, which we thought would be a party atmosphere, but lacked any direction and felt like an up-market buffet with poor to non-existent entertainment.  The ball room finished at 11, which left us an hour to kill before the fireworks.  We went to the 'Tent' to listen to the band and had anticipated some excellent entertainment, but felt more like my youth at the local Working Mens Club, but with Champagne.  The fireworks were very good, but we were herded into a very small viewing area, with the views blocked by huge lights.  We found the whole experience, very, very disappointing.

Upon checking out there was a problem with our bill and we noticed an overcharge (which hadn't been there in the morning when we had checked our bill).  Despite the Duty Manager promising to sort out a credit to our card within 4 days, after two emails, we still have heard nothing back from the hotel and are still £200 out of pocket.  Hopefully this will be sorted out soon!

Taking all the above into account, we would return to this lovely hotel again, but NOT over New Year.  I know this is a 7* Hotel, and I am not sure what contributes to making a hotel receive such a high rating, the accommodation was fantastic, but is it overall any better than Sandy Lane in Barbados - not really sure?","4","2012-12"
"still unique.","Over all, this place is still unique. I would not say elegant, but different and bold in every inch. Surely entertaining, colourfull, surprising. Terrific dining, incredible stay experience. Overpriced too: this is still an hotel: what are you going to do more than sleeping? Try the 5p.m. tea as well as the Sky bar. Remember: there is a minimum cost at the first drink.","5","2012-04"
"Good Value, but not 7 Star","Tip: Ask for a suite in the lower floors, they are way more spacious!

The Hotel is one of my favorites, but I think they meanwhile have trouble to keep up their image.
The amenities in this Hotels aren't 7 star at all, even not 5 star. The Spa is very small and definitely needs renovation. The indoor pool is also very small and ""boring"".
The outdoor pool area could as well be from a cheap 3 Star resort.

The service however is outstanding.
I recommend going there because of the fact that you can use all of the amenities of Jumeirah properties nearby (which are nicer than from BAA sometimes).

The rooms are incredible spacious on lower floors, considering the space I'd say that the suites are quite cheap.","4","2012-09"
"Royalty","This is the most incredible hotel I have ever stayed in. A hotel fit for Kings. Check-in is inside the suite, but the brief wait in the lobby has you surrounded by water fountains as well as two multi-level aquariums. Complimentary fresh figs and refreshing towels make the five minute wait relaxing. I stayed in a two floor, two bedroom suite which was absolutely beautiful. Each window had a water view. The complimentary water, wine, fresh fruit and fruit drink were delicious. The suite had two living rooms. There was a sundial clock on the wall which was so unique. Flat screen TVs everywhere. A dining room table for six had at least two dozen red roses on it. Three bathrooms were stocked with full size Hermes products - I am now hooked on them. There was a full size kitchen which was totally unnecessary because the food served was amazing. The bedrooms were huge, ornate and very, very comfortable.The service was outstanding. Your every comfort is cared for. The suite had a private butler waiting at all times to assist. The TV changer opens the door to the suite, so there is no need to get up. Unbelievable! If you have the opportunity to go to Dubai, you must stay here. It is the total experience.","5","2012-02"
"Excess at its finest","We stayed at the Burj for two nights at the start of our honeymoon recently.  Its an amazing creature, just standing in the lobby looking up will take your breath away.  On arrival we were immediately greeted and taken to our room for check-in.  We stayed in a lovely one-bedroom suite, our butler was very helpful and courteous and gave us a full tour of the room and amenities.  One of the things my husband liked best was the concierge/butler desk located on each floor of the hotel.  This allowed us quick and friend service without going downstairs to the desk or calling which we enjoyed.  All the staff here is friendly and quick to meet your needs.  We enjoyed several of the restaurants and the wonderful bar on the top of the hotel as well.  
They sent us a wonderful cake to celebrate our honeymoon and treated us very well.  

I left off one star purely because the hotel's decor is too over the top for me and almost felt Vegas-like and our butler was quite nosey and admitted that he was in our room when housekeeping was cleaning to ""observe our habits"" which made me a bit uncomfortable.  Even if this is a policy to enhance your stay, I did not need to know about it nor did I need him to detail that he thought we had ""a good night"" based on what he found.

I would consider staying here again for vacation, for work I would prefer to be closer to the city center as the hotel is on the beach.  It is definitely something to try once if you have the time and money, you will not regret it.

We also had massages at the spa which were absolutely wonderful and highly recommended.","4","2012-12"

"Top Notch - the best way to be spoiled","What a wonderful anniversary we had staying in The Burj - from the second we walked in, until we left, everything was perfect.  Only complaint - we didn't have the opportunity to stay longer! Wonderful service, excellent butler service (they found my husband a sports coat and black shoes for the restaurant), drew a jacuzzi for us, brought us drinks and appetizers at 7:00 p.m.  Just class from the minute we arrived until we left.  Loved Dubai as well! Where can I sign up to live there!","5","2012-12"
"Complete Heaven on earth","I do not think i can get it on screen exactly how i feel about this hotel.....my fourth visit and first time to stay....it was amazing and as Wow as i imagined staying here would be. We have just returned to Ireland...too short on this occasion...but will go back next year for sure. We arrived into absolute class - wonderful suite....heavenly views....everything in our suite we could possibly ask for. The staff were very helpful, friendly and courteous. The food was amazing at breakfast...never forget it. I loved breakfast time -  I have been totally enchanted by the aura within the hotel. I loved the atmosphere and loved getting dressed up in my lovely dresses every day- i felt a million dollars while here and we were made feel a million dollars here...LOL We will be back for sure...nothing will surpass this hotel for me. If you are thinking about staying here - just do it - it will stay with you forever !!    I LOVE THE BURJ AL ARAB","5","2012-12"
"Average. Oops!","Don't believe them when they say, ""It will take your breath away!"" because it won't. It is an opulent hotel but may not be to your taste. The synchronized dancing fountains are pretty and the service is wonderful but it all falls flat on it's face when the food is served.

I did NOT spend a night at the hotel. I attended a small gathering of about 30 at Tameen, a banquet hall on the 27th floor. The view was nice, the stewards were attentive, the carpet was plush and the restroom floors were clean enough to eat off. I wish I had more words to describe the food other than average. Oh well, what they lacked in quality was made up by the quantity and variety.","3","2012-12"
"Poor Quality Stay at a 7 star in Name Only","Have you ever been to a hotel that tries so hard that it falls in on itself when things go badly?  Well if you want to experience that I'd stay here.

At this property you have a hotel staff who tries as hard as possible.  80% of them get it right but the remaining 20% who get it wrong ~ they get it sooooo wrong that their efforts work in reverse to make your stay more unpleasant.

Butlers who linger too long..  or who take their cell calls from your room - I have no shame so I politely asked them to please not take calls from others in my presence..  I did it politely in a helpful educative manner so that they would learn, but am sure the sentiment left them taken aback because it's so hard to say that without offending..  But the point stands, they shouldn't be taking calls from anyone in another guests presence. Not something you would expect in a 7 star.

The property is finished as a 7 star but has 5 year old AMX touch panels which stall and have delays controlling the electronics of the room ( I know this because one of our several homes had this same ""technology"" and we recently ripped it out and threw it away because it works so poorly) It was both re-asuring and disquieting to find that it worked in the same poor fashion in this property as it did in our own; and that we were wise to replace the automation with Apple's more costly and better Savant technology.  

Then there is the food which always came slowly and always came cold, predominantly because the hotel sends food from long distances in hot-boxes without heating elements.. I am shocked that nobody in the dining department addressed this sooner.

I could honestly go on-and-on and nit-pick, but you all get the drift..  this hotel tries very hard.. I genuinely respect them for trying, but they get it wrong so much that I would be doing them no service by cheerleading their failures. And they are certainly no 7 star.  This is all marketing..  The highest stars one can get are 5..  they just thought so well of themselves that they gave themselves a seven..  2 above the possible number.  If you never get to this part of the world and wonder what it's like imagine what the Bellagio in Las Vegas would be like with 20% more service staff and less people.

The best thing about Dubai is honestly the shopping and this hotel is 30 minutes away from that at Dubai Mall (leave Emirates Mall behind as the only reason to go there is the skiing it's too crowded with locals and cheap shops to matter to you) All the best shopping and even good ""average shopping"" is in greater quantities at Dubai Mall by the Burj Kahliffa [tallest tower]) ..  so there is no real reason to stay so far away other than to prove (as I did) that you bought into the seven-star marketing hype, and to say you stayed at this Dubai landmark..

Absolutely terrible sleep quality driven by mushy soft mattresses and the incessant drone of the gigantic air-conditioning evaporators which cool these rooms from the relentless desert heat were the crowning glory here.  There was complimentary tea and coffee here but they replaced the teapot unwashed on our first night and it put us off using the services the following nights.

Also - fair warning to those with allergies that the hotel overdid it on fragrant allergenic Potpouri type scents.","2","2012-12"
"Most Luxurious Hotel in the World: Yes it is!","This is a truly iconic hotel and you know from the moment you are stopped by security that they take this very seriously.  We went for a week: a birthday treat in one of the panoramic suites.  All the room are suites, but the panoramic suites are on a corner and so you get about a 270 degree view.  We overlooked the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, marina and distant views of Dubai city: stunning particularly at night.
The suite is spread over two floors, bedroom and bathroom above and study, bar and sitting room downstairs.  Rooms are linked by a curving staircase with blue and gold carpet, which fits in as there is gold everywhere. To keep this report within limits, I'll just tell you our rooms were outstanding in terms of facilities, furniture and decor. 
Each level in the hotel is ""guarded"" by butlers, who are happy to sort out any arrangements you require, from ice to a limo to the airport. Two male cleaners seemed to work at least an hour cleaning and tidying the rooms; and we weren't that untidy either!
The outside pool areas and private beach were well attended by attentive staff, who regularly offered ice lollipops, fruit kebabs and popcorn during the afternoons.
In your room each evening are small gifts and often we were treated to pre-dinner canapés of superb quality. On my birthday, I was serenaded by 3 butlers, one with a guitar, and presented with a birthday cake. All very nicely done.
Everyone knows all this comes at a price, and with a staff to guest ratio of 6 to 1 I believe, the fantastic surroundings, all in I can't see how they make money even at their prices!","5","2012-12"
"Richest of the Riches feel small by its grandeur.Spot Global Celebs here","Located in the coastline ,most photographed place in the world best hotel in the world. I can go on & On ravishing hw dis is the best place I have been to.I got lucky to stay here as our tour agent , Dubaionsale.com , gave us some 20% discount on their package rates that gave us middle class folks to stay here & feel the riches world literally.

You could be sitting in a porsche with Bjorn Borg reading a newspaper aside you & you might see Snoop Dog munching that Hamburger.Yes , Celebs here r aplenty , if u r there u ll for sure witness one or more of them sans their style & persona.The Hotel is bigger than most or at least towers over most celebs.they r treated like commoners here except a Diplomat or an Oil Tycoon

just 25 km from the Dubai international airport and it’s a landmark and stands 280 meters on a island.Our room ws very big suit among many types of rooms are there : one bedroom deluxe suite, two bedroom deluxe suite, panaramis suite, club suite, diplomatic suite, presidential suite.Best is royal suit but that costs our entire 1 month salary so forget that

The food is awesome here all types of food are available in the hotel and the sea food is just amazing and hotel has many restaurants jumerah restaurants and bars bar are open till 12 am .Drinks start at 100 USD/peg so ur call

 The hotel staff is excellent they do their job with sincerity they swept our rooms 2 times a day. Rooms has all the modern facilities like led TV , DVD player, mini bar and it’s a very big hotel in Dubai and many activities you can do in the hotel like shopping, sightseeing, golf course is also there in the hotel .Golfing, again has a hefty charge

The view from the hotel is just awesome and you can see full Dubai from your room and rooms has private balcony also where in the night you can enjoy the sound of the sea. 

Spa and health club is also there in hotel and kids area for playing is there where children can enjoy and in my opinion this is the best place in the world","4","2012-11"
"Best one!","Best hotel I have ever been to. Hotel staff was impeccably excellent, the rooms are very luxurious, although the design might not appeal to all, and the views out of this world (we were on the 22nd floor... which translates to 44th and 45th floor in a standard hotel). 

Food also of very high standards. In essence, the hotel lives up to its reputation as the most luxurious on earth. All topped by the birthday cake and orchestra they brought to our room in occasion of my birthday. Really a memorable stay.","5","2012-08"
"Excessive and I love it","Stayed in panoramic one bedroom suite in July 2012.  Arrived in Dubai on an early flight and we were allowed to checkin to our suite early with no issues.  The suite itself is huge, as expected, with fantastic views through the floor to ceiling windows.  Lights, curtains, etc. were controlled with a tablet.  Door could be opened remotely by video phone.  The suite included a full desktop computer and free wi-fi.  Full sized Hermes bathroom amenities and perfume and cologne were included.   The lobby and fountain are spectacular, it seems like half the hotel is plated with gold.  One of the restaurant bars had a ceiling which was a replica of the Milky Way made of Swarovski crystals.  Everything in the suite and hotel is over the top, extravagant and excessive.  The included breakfast was huge and delicious although we were charged for breakfast the first morning even though we were told it was included at time of checkin.  Breakfast is brought to your room by 2 waiters who bring a toaster with them to toast your bread insuite for you.  Complimentary afternoon snack were brought to our suite everyday.  We did the culinary flight which allowed us to sample all of their restaurants, which was a great experience.  The Skyview Bar and Al Mahara aquarium restaurant are a must see.  The floor butler made sure everything was taken care of for you, even opening the room door for you when you returned to your suite.  Beach service was attentive and they provide you with a cooler full of cold water, cold towels and misters.  They would also bring you popsicles every once in a while.  A definite must for 40 degree temperatures.  The biggest gripe I have about the hotel is that they failed to answer any of the multiple emails I sent them prior to arrival with respect to sponsoring me for my visa to Dubai or requests for checkin preferences.  It is simply unacceptable for a hotel to not respond to emails from your guests in this day and age.  Other than that it was an amazing experience.","5","2012-07"
"Architectural Beauty","Well, I was there on a business trip representing my company and boy was the experience overwhelming or was it overwhelming. I mean the place is not just a hotel its an architectural wonder. With the best views I have ever seen and the best services in every kind the people of Dubai must be keen to make this their trade mark :)","5","2012-11"
"Over the Top","I am giving this hotel 5 stars because it really does hit all the marks (as you would expect). And I only stayed one night, so I don't know if I adequately experience the place.  But I have to say (just as a matter of personal taste) it was too over the top for me.  The staff are dedicated and trying very hard - but to me it felt oppressive.  The 2 story rooms are ludicrously well-appointed - but for me it was a little too glitzy and formal. The food is excellent - but it felt like a mini photo shoot at every meal b/c so many people are documenting their trips.  I guess I would urge people to look at the photos and see if it appeals to you.","5","2012-08"
"Flashy and over-priced","It was amazing place to visit, a bit tacky in places. It was EXTREMELY over-priced. If the staff suss that you're only there to look and not to spend your livelihoods, they would then ignore you to the best of their abilities.
I'd go if your in Dubai just to see the fast cars and the rich people - if you are minted, then it's well worth at least a one night stay because the rooms are AMAZING.","4",
"The best hotel we have stayed at","Just an amazing experience .. from arrival to departure we were made to feel very special by the Jumeirah staff. The suites are huge and the views are fabulous overlooking the sea and onto downtown Dubai in the distance. Breakfast was sumptuous! Loved the indoor pool and sauna facilities too! We enjoyed the private beach and being transported by buggy everywhere that we wanted to go. For example its easy to get over to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel for a drink or something to eat and we visited the Souk at the Madinat property which is part of the same complex. Overall the stay was perfect .. and nice to see where the rich and famous hang out when in Dubai! A once in a lifetime experience!","5","2012-11"
"Exclusive. Awesome whatever you do.","We were met ON the plane. Our luggage was collected and we were chauffered to the hotel. VIP check in. Duplex double room (two bedrooms over two floors with sweeping staircase) there were only 2 of us staying. Floor to ceiling windows. Tiniest pool ever with a life guard. The biggest 3 rooms of breakfasts reflecting world tastes (american, scottish kipppers, english fried, asian sushi, french pastries, its all within these rooms). Free entry to Wild Wadi a very fun water park, no walking with your rubber ring - you get jettisoned to the top via upward slides!). Any wine is £100 bottle. Any meal is £100 per couple. You can have lovely sea views. the round seafood restaurant  at the end of the marina is great view and food. At the Burj skytop bar it was lovely to see the coastal views. Butler service was faultless. If you left something in your room (suncream etc), they would go and retrieve it for you! We went to Burj on an offer an paid a fraction of the advertised prices. We couldnt afford to go back, but would if we could.","5","2012-01"
"Another dimension","I spent 3 days at this memorable  hotel. 

You may like or not the sometimes very ornate decoration, full of strong bright colors and gold (yes, pure gold sometimes), however the 2 floors with total 170 square metres smallest room was an entire experience. Not only because it is equipped with whichever the instrument you may think (and if it is not, the hotel will get it for you) but also because of the extremely friendly, efficient and polite service.

Many comments at TripAdvisor for this hotel only refer to the restaurants, many of them complaining about the price, however , specially in this HOTEL it should be limited to guests that stayed in the hotel in order to have a real idea of what the hotel is.

The check-in and is done at the room, while the butler explains, during more than half an hour all the facilities in the room and hotel. Check-out is also done at the room.

The management and the service always surprise you with unexpected pleasant details.

Whatever you need is always solved in a matter of minutes, either by the team of butlers at the plant reception desk (each plant has a reception desk).

The concierge solved perfectly all my needs for tours.

The pool of the spa at the 20th floor has an impressive view.

The restaurants were excellent. The bars were cozy and elegant. The shopping arcade offered a wide luxury choice.

The lobby is spectacular.

The only items to comply are the free wifi as the signal had eventual interruptions and the European breakfast, served by the pool, which rather matches with a high four stars / medium five stars hotel. Breakfast at the room was much better than the buffet.

This is a strongly recommendable hotel, if you can pay the around 2.000 euros per night that it costs, although the value of the details you get from the hotel can mean half that fee.","5","2012-11"
"Iconic Structure, Superlative Standards!!","We were transported to the Burj Al Arab in a virtually brand new Phantom Rolls Royce.  We took note of the hotel's logos subtly etched into the interior leather.  The driver was dressed in colonial chaffeur attire and was the epitomy of elegance and class.  We provided the chaffeur with our own selection of CD's and the sound system did not disappoint!

We had the privilege of enjoying one of the two presidential suites which affords an unusual welcome at the hotel with a large entourage of management awaiting one's arrival.  No matter how special you are or you think you are THIS makes you feel outrageously special!!

The arrival party and entrance was timeously executed providing a brief opportunity to greet various members of the welcoming entourage who offered rose water for your hands, delicious Arabian dates and the to-be-avoided-at-all-costs very strong Arabic coffee!

The entrance and atrium area is quite simply STUNNING and BREATHTAKING.  The mix of primary colors and gold leaf combined with the aquariums on either side of the escalators along with the water features make this unquestionably one of the most outstanding hotel lobbies anywhere in the world.

Considering this property is more than ten years old it is justified to compliment the remarkable achievements in keeping the hotel looking like it was opened last week.  On arrival at our suite floor we were greeted by a butler and a private receptionist both who escorted us to the awaiting presidential suite.  We were a party of two couples celebrating a wedding anniversary and 30th birthday.  As the suite door opened there was musical quartet who immediately broke into a chorus of song standing behind two exquisitely decorated tables bearing a cake for each celebration.  Champagne and orange juice was flowing freely and this welcome was singularly the best welcome in any hotel ever.

The next sixty minutes was occupied by a educational tour of how everything worked in the duplex two bedroom suite.  They have two almost identical presidentials which are generously well sized at 667 sq.meters.  We were in the master bedroom which enjoys the most spectacular bathroom you could image.  Our friends, for whom this was their first visit to Burj Al Arab, were overwhelmed and became somewhat emotional at the sheer beauty, palatial feel of the suite and the warm hospitality.

We basically lived in the suite and the hotel over the next seven days.  My thinking is quite simple if you work out how much you are paying per minute to stay at Burj Al Arab you simply can't afford to leave the hotel and visit somewhere else!!  Whilst the hotel is not massive with 202 suites but there is plenty to do and so many aspects to staying at Burj Al Arab.

How we made the trip to successful to Dubai was we stayed at a sister property first and from there did all the shopping and sightseeing that our group wanted to do before we transferred to Burj Al Arab.  Our advice to anyone staying at Burj Al Arab is simply not to leave the property when you are there.  The pool and jacuzzi area is smallish but exclusive.  Each restaurant is unique and the inroom dining is an experience all on its own.

Regarding the restaurants we would comment that the Al Muntaha, located at the top of the hotel is ideal for lunch as the views are expansive over Palm Jumeirah but at night the reflected glass limits external views.  The Bab Al Yam and Junsui are both great choices for breakfast and offer exceptional menu selections.  The Al Mahara was a perfect choice for our special celebration dinner.  The tables all have views of the acquarium which is maintained at the highest standard and contains exotic fish from different parts of the world.

The Assawan Spa provides for a communial area on the men's side where we could all gather for a hot tub and swimming pool experience - this area is beautifully decorated and the views are simply gorgeous.

Staying at the Burj Al Arab allows you to act like you own the place and you eventually end up running around in your shorts, flip flops and luxurious robe during the day as if you were lounging around your own pool!!

We requested a tour of the various suite types and were exceptionally impressed with everything we saw.  The entry level suite has nothing ""entry level"" about it.  Every suite is duplex in design, living area downstairs, sleeping area upstairs with the exception of the three bedroom diplomatic suites which have one twin bedroom on the lower level.  We were impressed with the Club Suite which had an elevator in case someone couldn't handle the stairs.  As to be expected the two Royal Suites are simply off the charts complete with revolving bed in the master bedroom.

Overall an amazing success story to think that after one decade of being opened no other hotel in the world has been able to knock this one property off its perch as being recognized as simpley ""the best hotel in the world"".

We are not newcomers to Jumeirah and have been consistenly impressed every time we have returned to Burj Al Arab that their standards of service, food quality and delivery and management on hand when needed remains simply superlative!

To be cost conscious for a moment, this hotel is never inexpensive and you will never find a ""hot deal"" on a discounted site BUT when you understand how extreme climates can affect hotel occupancy and pricing we have benefitted by visiting in the hottest months of the year, July/August, and in so doing often purchase rooms 50% cheaper than the cooler months, January/February.  Fortunately the AC works really well!!!","5","2012-04"
"Amazing","I and my boyfriend spent 2 days in Dubai. It was the best experience I have ever had. Room perfect, food fanstastic and varied and service could never be surpassed. The lasting impression of the Burj AL Arab apart from the luxury was the attitude of all the staff who all seemed delighted to to see us and told us how proud they were to work at such a great hotel.We highly recommend this hotel especially the Sky View Bar for afternoon tea. Views from this bar are amazing.","5","2012-11"
"Outstanding room and service","We spent 2 nights in the Burj Al Arab.
Everything, from the very first moment, is very well organized: from the pick-up at the airport until the check-out...
Great service! Great rooms! Great staff!
We slept for 14 hours in the first night, since, the rooms are so well-isolated, you don't hear anything, no noise, no wind, nothing. The rooms are really 7 stars!
Same as the staff: nevertheless the hotel's reputation and ranking, the service is very personal and ""easy-going"", you feel like home.
100% recommendable.","5","2012-09"
"Simply the Best","It is simply the best hotel ive ever stayed in. The suites are on 2 floors with the most amazing bathroom you could wish for. Huge bath and shower. The lounge is amazing with floor to ceiling windows and the decor throughout is so over the top and would not be allowed anywhere other than here. They have a pillow menu, can you beleive it, a pillow menu. I chose the goose feather. It is rightly regarded as one of the best hotels in the world. Try and stay here for at least one night before you die.","5","2012-07"
"The best hotel we have stayed in for along time","Stay here.......we can be fussy but this was perfect, absolutely perfect. From the second you are collected from the airport you are truly looked after and cared for. Nothing appeared too much trouble for them. We will stay here again .  If it makes any difference we were in room 610 and could not fault it.","5","2012-11"
"Nice hotel but too touristy!","My husband and I stayed here in October for a couple if nights. My husband had booked it as a surprise for me as it was our one year wedding anniversary. 
I have to say that overall we were very dissapointed with the hotel. Having just spend a wonderful 5 nights staying at another hotel on the Palm we were both very excited to visit the Burj. The suites are lovely and the hotel is a great piece of architecture, however the decor of the hotel is very dated. 
We were also very dissapointed with the pool area, the pool itself is tiny and sunbeds by the pool are hard to get-if you don't get a subbed right by the pool then your only other option is to take one in the grass far away. 
I would also recommend that you have breakfast delivered to your room as we did this one morning and it was lovely, the other morning we went down to breakfast by the pool which was extremely disappointing (only children's cereals avaliable and poor service). 
Another point is that the hotel gets SO busy with tourists having tours and people visiting for the day to have afternoon tea or drinks. This means that you are often queuing for the elevators and fighting your way through people, not something which I like to do on holiday at my hotel. 

Overall a disappointing stay and unfortunatly we will not be returning. When you pay this much for a hotel you expect the best and unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. ","3","2012-10"
"AMAZING","Every time i visit Dubai i stay at this hotel it's quite! the exterior and interior design is creative and luxury, room was very nice and the service is great they are super friendly, SkyBar and the asian restaurant was excellant! highly recommended.","5","2012-09"
"Never ceases to amaze","Fourth time at the Burj and  it still takes your breath away like the first time.......beyond excellent....the rooms,the spa, the breakfast, the airport limo service....only downside I can think of is that in the last few years staying at the Burj has meant we never spend too much time in Dubai itself....the hotel is so fantastic....you just never want to leave!!","5","2011-12"
"You don’t see a person twice ! Such a Big-Lavish Hotel . My Elaborate Take","We were on our honeymoon trip to Dubai for 5 days and 4 nights &  booked our package through Dubaionsale.com & got a cheap deal ( 15% off) on stay & sightseeing at Burj-al-Arab.BurjArab -a tourist paradise tht offers  more attraction, shopping, fine dining and quality hotel experience. This was my first tour de Dubai.

 Location:

The Burj Al Arab hotel is the best hotel in world located on Dubai’s Jumeriah Beach Strip, 15 km from main city centre and 25 km from Dubai International hotel. They have reception desk on every floor and butler services. 

Rooms:

	Since we had booked the honeymoon package, they gave us panoramic suite which offers us panoramic views of Arabian Gulf through the floor to ceiling glass windows in extremely luxurious setting. The lower level of the suite had living room with attached guest wash room. The upper level comprises of bedroom, bathroom and dressing room. The suite was elegantly furnished with dining table and couch in the living room and the king size bed and wardrobes in the bedroom. The full- size Hermes bathroom products were also there. 

Restaurant and food:

The hotel comprises of 7 restaurants. Bab Al Yam, poolside café restaurant provides informal and a fresco dining with attractive sea view. We also tried food in Al Muntaha , which is a restaurant 200 metres above the sea level and having the dinner seems in this restaurant seems like adventure with sound of tides. 

Staff:

	The staff was absolutely fabulous- from the receptionist to the waiters to the cleaners. They were very polite, helpful and professional. Although the staff was too big but the coordination between them was really appreciable, heads off to the management of the hotel.

	Overall hotel is awesome; it is really a good entertainment package. Everyone should try culinary flight; this is one of the major attractions of the hotel.","4","2012-11"
"burj al arab","it was such an amazing place to go to and if you need anything you will have it instantly the only down side is that there are alot of people around you but alot of security. there is the most beautiful fountains when you walk in and there are loads of really nice cars there like Rolls-Royce's the only thing is that it is really expensive. if i could i would live here it is the best place you could go to with your family and there is something for everyone like waterskiing for the men water parks for the kids and the spa for the women there is every thing you would want and more in a hotel. this hotel is really expensive but really worth it seeing everyone in your family having happy smiles on their faces relaxed and having fun all around you.i have absolutely fallen in love with this hotel. but my part of this hotel that i love is the submarine restaurant it is amazing it is at the base of the hotel with lots of fish swimming all around you. there are alot of all different types of fish which you think you wouldn't see now i am going back every year because i love it to much i couldn't stay away","5","2011-12"
"It is everything you would expect it to be .....","This place is pretty amazing.   Decor is decadent to say the least, but the suites are so very comfortable with every creature comfort at your fingertips, that you do become immune to the gold and gilt.   We stayed in a standard suite and it is HUGE,  and of course the views are  absolutely stunning from the living room and bedroom..   The food is generally pretty good, but breakfast was a bit of a dissapointment.  Had an amazing dinner at Al Muntaha.  Service is spectacular

The swimming pool and swimming area are badly in need of some attention, although to be honest we didn't want to leave our suite so it didn't matter to us.","5","2012-10"
"Pure indulgent luxury!","We stayed here for 5 nights in October 2011. We were greeted in luxurious lounge at the airport until our car arrived then transferred swiftly to the hotel where we were greeted by numerous polite staff bearing, warm flannels, dates, drinks and very welcoming miles. They knew us by name before we had the chance to tell them ourselves. Our suite was beautiful! Spacious, light, clean, amazing views and with the most comfortable bed imaginable! Decor and furnishings were so luxurious. The bathrooms were equipped with Hermes toiletries for both men and ladies. They thought of everything! We had gifts left in our room daily whether it be perfume on my pillow or cakes at our inning table! Just amazing! We never needed a room key ever! Whenever we got out of the lift our floor butler would greet us, walk us to the room, open the door and fix us a drink! Nothing was too much trouble and everyone was so helpful! The restaurants were beautiful but as expected were rather expensive! Even in the restaurants staff knew who you were as you arrived! The beach was gorgeous with butlers regularly bringing drink, fresh fruit or frozen lollies. The whole experience was AMAZING! Would love to go back! Even if it was just to indulge in  the unique cocktails in the Skyview bar! Gorgeous!","5","2011-12"
"Marvellous","Stayed here with my husband and daughter for 2 nights .It was the best experience I have ever had .I would definatly stay again for a special occasion .The service was 1st class always .The most amazing hotel I have ever stayed in .Second to none well worth the money.fabulous .","5","2011-12"
"Over the top opulence","We stayed here for three nights. The hotel is incredible but too much for most people unless you have an unlimited budget! Our room had a view to die for. The biggest let down is the tiny swimming pool tucked around the side. But you can use the Executive pool at the Jumeirah Beach hotel and transport is supplied courtesy of buggies.","5",
"EXCELLENCE IN ITS SIMPLIEST FORM","My wife, my two sons and I stayed here for 4 nights in a two bed suite. Our own bultler was much welcome after a tiring flight. Accomodation is magnificent. Room perfect, food fanstastic and varied and service could never be surpassed. Fantastic pick up and collection from airport. This accomodation is truely amazing and worth every penny and I look forward to returning very soon.","5","2012-09"
"Pure Indulgeance","The Burj Al Arab in Dubai has got to be the finest in the world. Your every need is met, sometimes even without asking but not at all pretentious. The staff are brilliant, kind and gentle in their manner. Nothing is any trouble for them at all. The food is unbelieveable. A feast for your eyes as well as to eat. The breakfasts cater for every nationality and is so fresh and replenished all the time rather than having huge plates just sitting. All the products in the bathroom are Hermes, and each evening there is a gift on your turned-down bed. Boxes of chocolates, perfumes, small wrapped towels. Unbelieveable. My son stayed there for his honeymoon and raved about it, so my husband and I went for 5 days. Loved it so much we took our daughters for a week. I could go on and on about this fantastic hotel, you must see for yourselves. All the rooms are suites and the views over Dubai are fantastic. It is also good that you have to either stay there or book in for tea or dinner to get in otherwise it would be swamped with people just wanting a look round and it's reputation is global.","5","2011-12"
"This must go as #1 on your bucket list.","Pure opulence, fantastic service, exquisite food and the most amazing view. We stayed in the Club Suite and had our own lift in our room. Attention to detail was outstanding. This is an experience like no other. Once you've had a taste, your going to want more. Our butler was at our service at a push of a button. The hairdressers was an experience in it's self. I had a silver service tea & coffee, head and shoulder massage and then the blow wave. WOW......We arrived with back packs & very casual clothing and treated like royalty every step of the way. This extraordinary 7 star hotel fills all your expectations and more......","5","2012-09"
"excellent","wow, this hotel is an unbelievable, eye candy @ its best in dubai.the whole experience was very unique and had an amazing time 4rom start to finish. i recommend this hotel to all my friends. am planning to visit there early next year. we were then given sandwiches, scones, friuts etc. the view was outstanding n service was luvly, as we were friends it was luvly to spend 3days @ the hotel n recommend it to all","5","2012-03"
"Unique experience","After booking our honeymoon in Dubai we started to look at things to do, we came across doing afternoon tea at the skybar. The whole experience was very unique and had an amazing time from start to finish. We we greeted by our waiter who shower us to our table, only downside was we were unable to get a table next to the breathtaking view. We were then given a tea menu in which there was a wide variety of teas. We were then given fruits, sandwiches, scones. The view was outstanding and service was lovely, as we were a honeymoon couple it was lovely to spend the day at the hotel and would recommend it to all.","5","2012-06"
"A bucket list trip","This hotel is eye candy at its best.  A bit over the top for my taste, but still worth the price of admission!  Great view but if you are afraid of heights be sure to get a lower floor.  The high tea is fabulous and the souk that is very close provides some great shopping.  A side trip to Abu Dhabi is a must.","5","2012-06"
"Surreal","ott?maybe, but an unforgettable experience in every sense of the word.Service without pretence and genuine desire to give you the best time of your life.Close to everything while remaining exclusive(private beach etc.), also from what I saw,being an all suite hotel there was no inferior room.I will be back.","5","2012-09"
"The View of The Gulf","Inside the lobby you are helped and attended while checking in and guided through your room. The private beach is in a brilliant location and water. The restaurants' food is brilliant and there is so much to choose from. The Burj Al Arab is the best hotel in the world and is the best place to be.","5","2012-08"
"7* luxurious hotel of the world - stunning and breathtaking","PERFECT! It was overall a dream come true to stay there! It can't be any better!
Services and all facilities were outstanding and wonderful. We enjoyed every moment there!!!
Would definitely go back at any time!!
Can't say anything negative cause there is nothing to do better! We really hope to get back one day!!!","5","2012-10"
"7+ STAR HOTEL","It simply does not get nay better than this! From priority disembarking off of our Emirates flight, flying through passport control into our Rolls Royce Phantom. Offered ice cold face towels and a menu to chose our music from on our way to the hotel!

Each floor has its own concierge service, and they helped organising our shopping trips. Being in Burj official cars when out, drivers are pretty much allowed to park anywhere and go the wrong way up one way roads. Phone your driver when you are finished shopping and he will meet you at one of the shop entrances.

We had one of their special butler drawn rose baths, with relaxing music, rose petals in the water and 2 glasses of champagne. 

My only criticism, which isnt really a proper one, is that it all ended up becoming too much. Everywhere you turn, there is someone wanting to do something for you. Our suite was serviced twice a day - upstairs and down - with naughty, fattening treats brought into the room regularly.

Their submarine restaurant is an absolute must. 

One of things you ""have to see and do before you die"".

All OTT and vulgar, but wonderful!!!!","5","2012-06"
"Wow","Wonderful hotel in all meanings,from rooms which are astonishing ,service outrating to food and beverage excellent to the great amenities in bathroom and room as well.Very nice hotel,great location, great staff","5","2012-03"
"Wow!","Highly recommend this hotel especially the Sky View Bar for afternoon tea. Views from this bar are amazing. Thanks to the German speaking manager for all her recommendations for Dubai. If you're looking for luxurious hotel this is the place to stay!","5","2012-10"
"AN IMPOSSIPLE POSH!!!!!","I've no words to say how to stay!!! The personal concierge and wounderfull stuff - thanks for all of you, guies!! The reall eastern charm with a lot of comfortibiles! and a luxurious Roll-Roys Phantom to the airport....Everybady should taste it to feel the taste of the life!! Special thanks to the Guest manager LANA GULINA, who is the most charming and diplomatic Lady with a lot of kidness.","5","2012-10"
"An incredible 7 Star Hotel on Earth","Burj Al Arab is a luxury hotel located in Dubai. If you're visiting Dubai, this place is a must see. The only 7 stars hotel in the world, and just watching it would definitely make your day. This is a very special building that you will never get tired of seeing. At night when it changes color it looks even more beautiful.

Make sure you make reservations, as no one is allowed through the gate without one. Also, bear in mind the dress code and conservative values of the host country and the restaurant you are visiting. Most common way to visit the place is to book HIGH TEA reservation at SKY VIEW BAR or if you are looking to do something even more special then try their BRUNCH/LUNCH in their ULTIMATE restaurant AL-MUNTAHA. Both Sky view Bar and Al Muntaha are at the 27th floor, 200 m above sea level, providing breath taking views. 

Try to make reservation a week before your visit. At the time of the reservation, if you mention the special occasion, they will honor it. e.g. if you mentioned that you will be celebrating your honeymoon, in that case they will congratulate you as soon as you will arrive and place rose petals all over your table, or sometimes they offer rose to your wife. In case of Birthdays or anniversaries they offer special cakes. 

Try to reach the restaurant 10 min before time and request for a window table, these are limited in number. A window table next to coast will provide stunning views. Photography is allowed, however they will ask you not to make videos. 

You can have an ultimate brunch at Al Muntaha. And from beginning to end you will find it was a great experience. The hotel is beautiful and the view from the Al Muntaha restaurant, 200 m above the sea, are astonishing. The sea laps at the feet of the Burj al Arab, and it is mesmerizing watching the waves and the shades of blue stretch out into the distance. Seeing The Palm from the restaurant reminds you of the engineering marvel that it is. In short, at least half of what you spend here is for the view. The blue-green-aquamarine is carried through into the decor of the restaurant, and one fully expects a mermaid to swim up to you to take your order. Staff is very attentive as one would expect. Their explanation of dishes is good. The most difficult part is deciding what you want to eat as the menu has so many wonderful choices. The food is second to none, from lobster to oysters to sushi to roast to chocolate fountain... you will try your best but probably you will just be able to try 25% of the buffet. However the desserts did not sparkle. Brunch timings are from 10AM to 12 PM and cost 450 AED. Brunch is only offered on Fridays, if you stay after 12, it will be considered lunch and it cost 550 AED.

You can also try High Tea at Sky View Bar (The same place as that of Al-Muntaha). The tea consists of 7 ""courses"" starting with champagne and a short crust biscuit with fruit on it. Then served a ""caviar"" course. You then get sandwiches, pastries, scones, sorbet and lastly a few chocolates, all served on a platter in the shape of the sail. They also serve coffee and 20 different types of teas. Afternoon tea cost around 425 AED. Non-Alcoholic package is 100 AED less.

The service, needless to say, is flawless. The food is phenomenal. For anyone who appreciates the value of good food, you will not be left wanting. The assortment of foods is put together with your pallet in mind. Although the servings appear small, they are filling and there is always more at your beckon call. Any favorites can be repeated. You will yourself see why this is a self styled 7 star hotel. You will simply not visit a hotel elsewhere quite like it! 

Some people have reported to have little view at night, due to the heat haze, and reflection from the neon lights in the bar. If you only want to see this wonderful landmark and take some pictures, you can definitely do that. Wild Wadi is beside the area, so if you're planning to have some water adventure, you can as well bring your swim suits with you and enjoy the day on this nice area of Dubai. If you chose to take a dip at the beach if you just wanted to relax and feel the sea breeze, Jumeira beach is also very near to the area. 

Burj Al Arab has its own fleet of Taxis (including Rolce Royce, Mercedes and wagons) and helicopter. Some people have claimed that it’s not easy to get an outside taxi in Burj Al Arab on your way back; however I didn’t find problem calling RTA taxi, which reach within 3 min of call. The Rolce Royce taxis charge 150 AED for 10 min, but travelling in it is an incredible experience.

In Short, visiting Burj Al Arab is a once in a lifetime experience. The view is breathtaking, the sunset is monumental and the service is attentive to your style of dining.","5",
"This is World’s best .The question is  : Can you afford it ?","We  stayed here two days before moving to our company’s guest house. Found some 20% discount on their rates on Antilog Vacations website ( + free tour/pickup drop etc) & booked it ( else it wouldn’t have been possible) I found the hotel to be world’s most luxurious hotel gracefully shaped like the sail of boat and perched on its man-made island. The hotel is located 25 kms from the Dubai International airport. 

	Apart from the location of the hotel the interiors of the hotel is amazing too. They have reception and butler services on every floor. They assured that all our needs are met. We stayed in one bedroom deluxe suite with beautiful views of the Arabian Gulf. At the ground floor there was a living room with large lounge, dining table for four and a private bar counter. There was also a guest wash room in the ground floor. The suite features a handsome spiral staircase that leads you to the next floor. The next level of floor had dressing room, bedroom with king size bed and a bathroom. Bathroom too was luxurious with Jacuzzi. 

	We tried the food both at restaurant and in room. The quality and taste of food was same at both the places which was exceptionally good. Bur Al Arab has seven restaurants. Although we tried only one Al Mahara restaurant, specialty of this restaurant is sea food. 

	We take the full advantage all the other entertainments present in the hotel. The outdoor pool was very nice and had a stunning view. We went to the Spa which is located at 18th floor; there you can also enjoy the indoor pool viewing the whole city from there. 

	Hotel services were too good. The staff was from different countries and very well behaved. We really enjoyed our two days at this magical hotel. The memories at the hotel will always be in heart. 

If you are fortunate to get a good deal then it makes sense to stay here else prices are simply  exorbitant.Better start looking for deals on Burj-Al-Arab or settle for lesser","4","2012-09"
"The PowerHouse of Arabs; spectacular!","I can't thank Mr. Hilal & Marvin enough for showing me the Burj-Al-Arab. The aquarium at both sides of the escalators, the largest hotel atrium in the world, the beautiful Guest Relations, duplex rooms; were all top class. I particularly liked the rainbow effect that you can see on top, from the lobby level; very pleasing. The Sky Bar was a treat to the eyes and the underwater restaurant; looked amazing. Well if you can visit Burf Al Arab, you should and experience its automated beds, the spectacular views of the blue waters and let everything else be a surprise for you; you'll love it.","5",
"In a class of it's own, a very unique experience","Fortunately this was a return visit to the Burj Al Arab, it truly is a world class hotel and is derservant of more stars over and above the 5 above.  The staff go over and above to ensure your stay is memorable in this landmark building.

At the airport we were met by a Phantom Rolls Royce, I am not much of a car person but can appreciate a beautiful car and the luxurious feeling you get when travelling in it.  Following a 20 minute ride we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a line of 5 people all smiling and offering dates, cold towels and Arabian coffee before being escorted to our room.  The rooms are huge, all suites, 2 storey and with 2 bathrooms.  There is 24 hour butler service to cater for any needs one might have.  The bathrooms are great to unwind in with massive spa baths and the most impressive shower I have ever been in, water was coming from every angle!

Around the hotel, level 18 has the spa.  As you would expect complete luxury, separated into 2 wings for men and women.  I spent time between the steam room, the cold plunge pool (15 degrees) and the infinity pool overlooking all of Dubai.  The Burj also has a fully equipped gym with all the latest equipment and a private beach which must you must check out.  The water is so salty you float, it is also crystal clear, calm and quite warm.  Easy for any swimmer as there are not strong waves.

At sunset we took a buggy from the hotel to the 360 degrees bar, it was a perfect sunset and we got some really good shots of the Burj while sipping champagne and trying a double apple Shisha.  We slipped back to the hotel and went to the bar at the top of the Burj for a nightcap which ended a very memorable stay at this fine establishment.

We had breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, it was buffet and the produce was outstanding. All the berries were fresh and ripe.  It was nice to enjoy sampling small bits of the extensive offering. While not on the menu you can also request 'pig' bacon if you like it from the chef.

Would just like to make a special mention to Oscar the concierge manager, thankyou for making our stay so memorable.  His advice and tips were very much appreciated.","5","2012-10"
"Worth a visit, best in the world","Spending one night at Burj Al Arad is one of those once in a lifetime experience. The service is exceptional, and the room is actually an apartment. The leisure area and the restaurants are also fabulous. The only problem is the price, but the hotel is so fantastic that you will easily forget about the money issue. If there is any hotel better than this in the world, I cannot even imagine how it would be.","5","2012-06"
"A memorable experience!","Just returned from this fabulous hotel where I celebrated a special birthday.  I am most grateful to all the staff (especially the singing butler band!) who took time out of their duties to come to our suite and be part of my family's celebrations.  Thank you chaps!  Your lovely voices and lively instruments made the event even more memorable.  I was left speechless and very touched!!  All aspects of this hotel cannot be faulted.  From the staff at the beachhouse who cater to your every need providing free of charge cold rose scented towels, ice cold water and water sprays for those who feel the heat most to the mouthwatering variety of food served at five different restaurants within the hotel, even the most demanding of guests will not fail to applaud the management's desire to excel in all things. Superbly spacious accommodation (every suite occupies two floors and the bathrooms are as big as the bedrooms, which are huge by any one's standards). There is a 24 hour butler on each floor who attends to every need of each guest on their floor, including running ahead to open the door of your suite as soon as they see you appear!  I have been to many superb hotels but this one is unique!!  You have to see it to believe it.  My family and I cannot wait to return and enjoy more of the same.  Well done and thank you.","5","2012-09"
"It's The Best","This hotel is one of the best in the world. I Like the personal butler service and the excellent rooms. Great value for money.  Food in the hotel is simply the best as is the service. Loved the beautiful aquarium. Love the Rolls Royce Phantom Airport transfer to the hotel and the  helicopter transfer back to the airport.","5","2012-08"
"If you can afford it-stay there.","The flaming fountains at night, the entrance hall which is more like a funeral parlour than a 7 star hotel, the outstanding cuisine, the silly small sized swimming pool outside, the gorgeous beach, your own butler in the room, the views from your bedroom, the FABULOUS indoors pool and gym,the gold plated bannisters, the sinfully comfortable bed. At times you feel as if it is as Kitsch as Las Vegas, but then, somehow, it all fits together. Perhaps it is the canapés in your room, or the flaming fountains...","4",
"Best in the world","We first discovered Burj Al Arab, the world's first seven star hotel about 11 years ago, arriving  tired and grubby from a week in Oman, unprepared for a Butler wishing to unpack our dusty clothes. The offer was declined. Instead the lot went off to the the laundry.. This time, we were in far better shape. Some of the benefits of this over-the-top hotel include the sensational two-level suites, with a winding stair case and massive spa bath. The incredible attention to detail and unobtrusive service. is really appreciated. Luckilly our Dubai connections making the booking and pay the tab,.  .","5","2012-09"
"Great services","The room was fantastic, Hermes amenities, a 24 hour butler (his name is Mr Robert) service, everything was great, just one thing I have to make note here is about the dress code, i was having a meal at the restaurant inside this hotel they require us to wear a formal suit, gosh! i was on holiday where can i get it? thank god they do rent the suit and i can get the shoe from my butler. i love it.","4","2012-09"
"Kudos abounds","The rooms need to be seen ‘Versace on speed’ is the theme.  Each floor has a butler who manages to greet you at every passing, on arrival the butler asked what papers I would like delivered, I quipped, I didn’t want to read any news for the stay, the butler then stated to clear the room of any news material.  They do take you very literally.  The room has everything you could possibly need, computer, wireless and a butler to freshen your wardrobe before you hit the town, two great restaurants are very different, one with a huge aquarium, the other with amazing views at the top of the tower.

Getting a cab from reception unless you specify a city taxi you will get a Lexus which has a minimum 4 hour rental, just beware, having a driver waiting for you can be distracting if you are not used to such things.

I would stay again, but I cannot imagine that the place across the road is any less fun.  So if you are prepared to not care about how much, you will have fun here.","5","2012-09"
"Burj al Arab","Impressive hotel,nice location,excellent service!
The only problem is you cant take children at the restaurant from the 27 th floor. Also the majority were old-old people...
Its nice u have the wild wadi water park next to u,and madinat jumeirah..so u have were to spend time.","5","2011-10"
"Wow...this place is amazing!","Just had a fantastic two night say in the Burj. From the moment my wife and I arrived in the taxi to the moment we left the property we were treated like royalty (we're not by the way!). The staff are absolutely superb - from the private butler to the waiting staff and cleaners, they were all so polite and helpful it really made us realize what you pay for at the Burj and credit must be given to the Hotel Manager for running such a tight, well organized ship. As you're reading this review I assume you're considering a visit to the Burj and therefore I'll list a few points that I was interested in reading about when I booked the hotel -

We had a standard room which was amazing...definitely no reason to upgrade in my opinion. Without doubt the best hotel room we've ever stayed in and plenty of info/photos on trip advisor/web already.

Pool
It seemed to be quite difficult to find out much info about the pool when we were looking into booking the hotel and I guess this is because it's the one point that may disappoint due to it's size. It is still a lovely pool and no problem with sunbeds etc and comp cool box of ice water/face towels etc. but I did expect the pool to be a little larger than it is...so be prepared!

Culinary Flight
I would recommend this to anyone who stays in the hotel - it is a fantastic way to experience the best of the Burj in one evening - ours took from 7.00 till 11.30 to complete and was superb - I would recommend taking the package with the wine and go easy on the bread in the early rounds as most courses come with a basket of bread and you'll be too full to complete the meal if you're not careful.

Staff
As mentioned above, I have nothing but praise for the staff and they make the stay so extra special.

Beach
Superb private Beach on the mainland with comp golf buggy ride to reach it. Lots of sunbeds and bar/restaurant - also with the comp cool box.

Nice comp touches at the Burj:
Cool box at beach/pool
Daily paper of your choice downloaded, printed and delivered to your room
Free wifi throughout the resort
Fruit bowl in room
Bottle of wine on arrival
Wide range of movies (chargable in every other hotel I've stayed, but comp at the Burj.
Comp Jacket loan (I forgot my suits, so this saved me having to buy a new one).

To sum up the review, yes the Burj is expensive but I believe you do get value for money and I'll definitely be returning.

We stayed two nights at the Burj and then two nights at the one and only Royal Mirage for which I'll write a separate review.","5","2012-09"
"Unforgettable Experience","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab to celebrate my wife's 65th birthday and had an unbelievable experience, everything exceeded our expectations. We spent 2 afternoons at the pool and were amazed at the attention we got from the pool staff, supplying us with complimentary snacks, iced water, cold towels, ice lollies and rose water sprays, we also had our our sunglasses cleaned. Very decadent.
On the afternoon of my wife's birthday we had a surprise visit by eight members of staff who brought beautiful flowers and a lovely chocolate cake, we were a bit embarrassed as we were both dressed in bath robes after returning from the beach, but the staff loved it , sang happy birthday and took photographs, a magical experience we will fondly remember.
We booked the culinary flight with the wine package which started with a cocktail and then each of 5 courses were taken in a different  restaurant. We loved the whole experience and my wife was presented with two books during the evening. The staff were so friendly and the Sommeliers in each restaurant took time to discuss the wine selection in a friendly, easy going manner.
We had room service one night, another experience not to be missed, where the waiter set up our dining table and we were provided with a complimentary bottle of wine. 
We arrived and departed in the Rolls Royce which completed a fantastic stay. 
The lasting impression of the Burj AL Arab apart from the luxury is the attitude of all the staff who all seemed delighted to to see us and told us how proud they were to work at such a great hotel.
Our favourite people were the two friendly big guys, Hardley and Duchka (?) who controlled and organised the transport at the front of the hotel, never failing to recognise and greet us by name with big smiles. Duchka kindly took a lot of photographs of us before we left.
If you have the opportunity to stay here - do it! you won't be disappointed.","5",
"Not worth the money","On our trip we stayed at five different hotels, all five star and all with butler service.   Actually found the hotel to be a bit tacky, honestly it belongs in Vegas.  The outside is beautiful but the inside, well I guess it all depends on your taste.   Our butler service was pretty much non existant and considering the amount of money being paid, that is not exceptable, we had to ask for things several times.  And when i told them we wanted to eat at Al mahara, several times I mentioned the ""fishtank"" resteraunt, and the night of the reservation they sent us to there other resteraunt at the top of the hotel, luckly they were able to change the reservataion.   At Al Mahara, all i can say is amazing.  The service and the food here was EXCEPTIONAL.   My only suggestion is to stay at another hotel but make a reservation here for dinner.    I see other reviews and am surprised at how great there service was.   its a shame that the floor we stayed on the service was very poor.   I can say that other than the butler service, the service throughout the hotel is very good.","3","2012-08"
"Stunning","My husband & I stayed here for only one night (sadly) for our wedding anniversary, which is one Valentine's Day. To be in this fabulous hotel on that day is amazing. The atrium was full of these huge hearts made from tiny red rose buds. The suite was to die for and you get to take all the full size hermes toiletries home with you. My husband arranged for one of the white Rolls Royce's to take us to dinner in the evening but in hindsight I wished we just stayed in the Burj. All in all a magical place, a magical memory that will last forever. Would love to return but for a longer stay - if the buget could stretch that far.","5","2012-02"
"At least do it once!","  Luxury all the way. A bit over the top but a must experience to do at least once in your life If you can.

   Picked up in the Rolls Royce for that extra treat, was well worth it as we were also expressed through customs which is part of the service.
   Rooms are very large all suites like an apartment more than a room, so I suppose not too badly priced when you consider what most Hotels charge for a suite.
   We gott a deal that included dinner and breakfast the food is faultless in every way but the charge for drinks will make you look twice as you would think it was for the food charge it was so high.

    I especially liked the indoor pool at the higher level (can't remember floor level)
The view from there was magic the Steam and spa rooms were also the best I have experienced.

  Watching the cars pull up at night Bentleys ,Porsches,lamborginis etc + the odd convoy of range rovers is an experience to watch in its self.

A bit over the top but defiantly an experience to do at least once.

"Really luxurious","This hotel is definitely the most luxurious hotel.  Everything in the Burj is over the top and you understand why the price is steep.  It is an experience worth every penny.  The suites are truly magnificent and the views are great.  One of the highlights from the suite is the staircase in the room that takes you to the second floor where the bedroom and master bathroom are (there is a bathroom on the first floor too).  The bedroom is beautiful and the master bathroom is spectacular.  The tile work is gorgeous.  ""included in your stay"" ammenities are large, including perfume and cologne. Be sure to use and take home the beach bag, it is included and it's a nice token.  

Be sure to enjoy the fresh fruit in your room, as they replenish it every time or whenever you would like more.

We did not eat at their restaurants because my husband did not bring closed shoes, so we ordered in room dining which was a lot more affordable.  Also, included in the room was a bottle of red wine we drank during dinner.  We read many reviews on Trip Advisor in regards to dining in the Burj and this also made our in room dining a better choice.  The food was ok, salty for our taste and not as great as you would expect from this type of luxurious hotel. Saying that, we did not stay in this hotel for the food, and we had read reviews about the food, so we knew what we were getting into.  For those people who only go to the Burj for the restaurants, I would say, save your money and actually stay for one night in the hotel.  That is a much better way to use your money.  The room experience is one of a life time.

Make full use of the included ammenities during your stay.  The outdoor pool is nice and has a beautiful view.  Go to the 18th floor where the spa is located and take advantage of the indoor pool free of charge.  The views from the infinity pool are spectacular.  It is worth going there for a dip and enjoy the view.  The tile work is also amazingly breathtaking.  

We also took advantage of their beach.  We went in August so the heat was ridiculously hot but we went very early in the morning to enjoy the bathtub warm water of the Arabian Sea.  You also get a great view of the Burj from the beach, worth going there to get good pictures.  Ask for a buggie to take you to the beach and around the sister Jumeriah hotels.  You get to see the Burj from afar and the other hotels which look very nice.  Worth doing for the pics.","5","2012-08"
"Still My Favourite Hotel","Just returned after a 1 night stay, booked two rooms, one for us and one for children.  Picked up by two white Roles Royces and given red roses, amazing! Stayed previously at this hotel a few years ago and it's still my favourite, this hotel is all about the rooms and service, the rooms are over the top and opulent and the best suite I have ever stayed in, if you love glitz and glamour this is the hotel for you.  Complimentary wine, dates, water and coffee supplied in room and received evening canapés, a lovely touch, not to mention all the Hermes products that the children loved. Service as usual very high, spa gorgeous all gold and over the top.  Private beach great with wonderful facilities, showers, hair dryers, lockers etc.  Pool very small, not the best, you can use JBH exec pool, but I am staying at Burj and want to use their facilities, service however great.  This hotel has always been one of my favourites as I just love the room and service and I will be returning for a longer stay for my 40th birthday in a couple of years, cannot wait. Just to point out I paid approx £950.00 for 1 suite which included all complimentary products stated above, you could not get a hotel suite in London of this standard and size with all products etc for this price, so in my opinion this hotel is value for money when compared to London hotel suite prices.","5","2012-09"
"Luxury and service worthy of the hype","I've lived in Dubai for about 6 years, and am a luxury hotel and travel aficionado.  However, I've never had much of a desire to try the Burj Al Arab because I was certain that it was overpriced and overrated, given that there are so many other luxurious hotels here - and ones that don't command such ridiculous prices.  However, when the opportunity came recently to take advantage of UAE resident summertime rates, my family and I decided to go for it - and my how my thinking changed!

From the moment of driving up to drop off the car and check in, everything was superb.  We were taken directly to the suite, and when we arrived into the lower floor living area, our daughter thought it was a lounge, not part of our room!  The decor, admittedly, is not to either my wife's nor my taste, but it was very luxurious.  The suite is incredibly spacious and just made us want to lounge there and soak it all in - along with the fabulous view!

One of the things that really distinguished the hotel though was the service.  After checking in, we realized we had forgotten a small plastic bag containing sunscreen and some other items in the car.  No problem.  Just call the butler, and have him get the valet to bring the car back and fetch the stuff out of it, and bring it up to us.

It was also our anniversary celebration, and the hotel gave us a wonderful cake, served on a table decorated in rose petals.  Not to be forgotten, the hotel brought by a selection of all kinds of candies for the kids to choose.  There were also even kid-sized pink and blue bathrobes for our son and daughter!

I was amazed at how they knew our names.  When the kids and I returned later than my wife from the pool, the staffing shift had changed, and so the floor manager and butler were different - they had never seen us.  Nevertheless, when we emerged from the elevator on our floor, I was greeted by name and so were the kids!  There's no need to carry your room key because the staff all know you and you never have to open your suite door yourself.

The food was also very good, and I loved the cold towels and iced drinks that they provide at the beach.

We've been fortunate to stay in some very nice places around the world, but the Burj Al Arab beats them all. The irony is that I never imagined that it could live up to such high expectations, but it even surpassed them.  If you can afford it, it's not to be missed!","5","2012-09"
"What ever happened to the sixth star?","So everyone at the Burj Al Arab will tell you that it is the world's first seven star hotel?  Under what rating system?  What ever happened to the sixth star?  

Nevertheless this tallest hotel in the world is pretty amazing.  The hotel boasts the worlds tallest atrium and apparantly each room looks down into the atrium.  If that weren't enough, the four columns that hold up the atrium are coated in 24 caret gold!

I did not stay here as the cheapest room was going for $900 (their smallest room, is a 1,000 sq. ft. duplex) and my company paid for another hotel.  I went into the Burj Al Arab in the cheapest method possible, which is a reservation at the Bab Al Yam - the cheapest restaurant in the Burj (which still cost $100 per person, not including drinks).  I was glad I did it, but I would probably not go back.","4",
"Luxury personified","Ignore all the other reviews, specially anything negative about the Burj Al arab,because quite simply this place is hard to beat.The service is over the top exceptional,yes,but i want that when i'm travelling,i want to be served and looked after.Whomever is the head trainer for the staff at the Burj then call me i would employ you tomorrow.The service is simply impeccable.The manners, the dress code.This place rightly deserves it's self imposed 6 Star rating,as it makes a 5 Star resort seem ordinary.Being guided into you room is just a jaw dropping feast,it's huge and on two sumptuous levels.Eight phones in your room is rather over the top,but everything is quality and you'll not want for anything. The hotel is over the top,i mean just look at it.But it's an ""over the top"" that works. The only negative that i will mention is that the pool area is not as inviting as you'd expect,although having the best pool service from the staff simply makes up for it.Anyone enjoy having a staff member clean you sunglasses for you,thought so..! The pool wasn't the best place to try and cool down though as the water temp,was rather on the hot side.But having the availability of the other Jumeirah resorts pools etc( by buggy) at your disposal gave you a great choice.
If you enjoy,appreciate and understand quality then this hotel is a must,if you don't,then this is not the place for you.Although do not miss out on Dubai.The people are very polite,accomodating and friendly.They have mastered the art of service.And the place is simply a city of the 21st century.","5","2012-07"
"Like in a dream - Oh, I want to go back to it!","The experience for life! Everything perfect - from welcoming dates and Arabic coffee, the interior design of the lobby and the room, the service and the atmosphere to the water in the outside pool - which was softened to leave your skin silk-like! :-)!
We had ""just"" a standard room - but it was actually a two-level suit, with a sea view and soooo specious! I am very glad my husband and I decided to stay there - we lived in Dubai, on Jumeirah and just 10 minutes driving from the hotel, but we wanted to treat us with something very special for the occasion we had - and we just could not resist to go into the Burj Al Arab! :-) 
Be aware that there are several categories of the prices depending on the time of the year, so you can afford this experience made for royals and celebrities! We stayed there in May when it was already unbearable hot outside, but we did not mind at all even being around the outside pool and visiting the beach - the stuff looked very well after us that we did not feel discomfort of the weather! :-)
When it comes to food - do not miss the breakfast - for it is the best in the world - with the choices of food from all around the world! Also, we highly recommend the high tea - at 1900 - with piano music and a feeling of being somewhere in the sky! :-) For dining - I would recommend all the restaurants except their ""underwater"" restaurant, for the food was noting special but only very expensive.Pity! 
The spa missed on an atmosphere of relaxation - but the treatment itself was effective - it left our skins smooth and soft! :-) 
And finally - we had our Hermes beauty gift-packages to take home from the hotel to remind us of our long weekend from dreams for a while after it all was finished! 
Congratulations to the management on running the hotel perfectly - and thanks to the superb trained stuff on all levels! Also, thank the owner for such a brave and successful business project! We loved the hotel - and Dubai!","5","2012-05"
"Overrated but an experience nonetheless","This is my 3rd time staying at the Burj Al Arab and I must admit that with each return, my opinion of the hotel, service and food has diminished.

My wife and I booked a Panoramic Suite and were given one on the 11th floor. The view over the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and north along the Dubai coast was stunning and the room was very large and spacious but the decor and fabrics are now becoming very tired and dated compared to other hotels in the UAE and Middle East. The gimics such as the remote control for window blinds and television have been upgraded since my last stay but are still only that, gimics. 

We had cocktails at the Skyview Bar before heading to Al Mahara restaurant for dinner. Cocktails at the Skyview Bar were very good but like so many hotels and bars in Dubai, the service was sorely lacking. The lack of fresh juices is also rather disappointing.

We chose the degustation menu at Al Mahara and were underwhelmed by the meal and service. The food was imaginative and very well presented but the flavour combinations in a number of the dishes simply didnt work (the kaffir lime/fish dish being a standout). The wine choices were acceptable but very mainstream and seemed formulaic with most choices complementing the flavours in the food instead of providing some contrast.

For breakfast on one of the days, I waited over 20 mins for an omlete with a side order of sliced ham.

Overall, its an experience and a tick in the box if you have a Bucket List but I would be hard pressed to recommend it as an ultimate luxury destination.","3","2012-08"
"A 21st birthday treat for son","We had a 2 bedroom suite on the 11 floor which was colossal in size and sumptuous in decor.  Check-in in room was smooth but long as the butler explained the facilities. 
Red bedroom with mirrors everywhere including above the bed was difficult as I kept sorting my hair out whenever I awoke in the night. A huge TV and chest stood in front of the panoramic view which was a pity. Blue bedroom and bathroom just beautiful.
Was very surprised that milk for the coffee maker consisted of the tiny pull top cups you might get in the local cafe. 
Breakfast was very nice but not very different to that which you would get in the other hotels in the group.  Staff were very attentive which was useful for my son who's leg was in plaster.

The staff were again very welcoming and helpful throughout the stay. A lovely touch was the birthday trio playing happy birthday, cake, sparkling juice (ramadam) and red roses in the suite. Thank you so much for that memorable little extra.","4","2012-08"
"Still lovely","We were collected by our BAA car from Zabeel Saray and whisked in peaceful luxury to BAA by a well dress driver who presented me with a beautiful bouquet of roses. When we arrived, staff were waiting for us and we were quickly taken up to our suite and checked-in. Bags arrived quickly and it was nice to see that they had remembered the little things like a specific pillow that I prefer and extra water for the coffee machine.

The suite is still beautiful but is starting to show signs of wear, but was spotlessly clean, still with Hermes products in abundance. The pool is also showing its age and in desperate need of an update, but remains clean and well patrolled by staff and lifeguards. The beach facilities have been spruced up with new furniture and looks much sleeker.  And they now provide cold boxes for the water instead of the buckets of ice.  Service remains attentive if not a little slow.

Food in Bab Al Yam, Junsui and on the beach remain excellent, with service to match. Junsui in particular is well worth the visit (see separate review). 

This time we took advantage of the free tickets to Wild Wadi. It’s been several years since we went there last and it’s nice that they have a resort entrance now away from the general public where you can grab towels and charge everything to your room.

We have stayed at BAA many times and this time the only disappointing thing about our stay at BAA was that the servicing of the suite was not up to usual standards, in terms of cleaning dirty cups and glasses away and resetting everything. Although it’s no hardship, it those small touches that make BAA special. Nonetheless staff here are still far better than at many other hotels in Dubai or even in the Jumeirah group and for that reason we will continue to return to BAA.","5","2012-08"
"WOW WOW WOW and can I say WOW again","This Hotel is the best Hotel I have stayed in for a very long time. It is worth the money and the 7 stars.

On arrival taken straight to your room, yes check in is done in your room. The doors open and WOW, WOW.  Gold everywhere and furnished over the top but to my mind still tasteful and what would you expect from 7 star anyway.

Once check in was completed our butler was introduced to us, he explained the room and all its trimings of sweet treats and wine. He also offered to unpack I did think about taking up his offer but has this was not our first stop in UAE I declined due to the dirty washing being scattered around.  Next time I stay I wil make sure dirty washing is in a carry bag or stay only at the Burj wouldn't that be lovely. The Bathrooms are grand none of the sample size toiletries full size.

Once unpacked we walked around the take everything in. Wow Wow. Every where you go they know your name this is a lovely surprise not sure how they do it, I know they take your passport at check in maybe they take a photo and have it all their systems.  I dont care how it was done it just made you feel like you were royalty rather than a guest.

We decided we would go back after our walk to our room for a rest before dinner. The Butler walked us to the door and even opened this was something they did every time we come back during our stay.

We booked into the culinary flight for dinner.  This is a must do, it is a degustion style menu but at different restaurants within the Hotel. Staff escort you to the restaurants once you have completed each course. Each restaurants treat you like you are their for a complete meal. At the last course once finished I was present with a full size birthday cake and a lovely bunch of roses. This is a must do.

On going back to our room after dinner again the butler opened the door and presented me with another full size birthday cake.  Just has well we had a few more days before our next hotel in the desert.

Breakfast is also a treat they have every thing you could possibly want it is well presented and lovely and fresh.

On the second day we went to the private beach a buggy takes and your are escorted to a sun lounge towels are placed and a esky of cold towels and drinks. Whilst the water was like a bath looking back at the Hotel is a wonderful view.

Second day we also had a afternoon tea which was sensational.  It is like a high tea but better as it is not all sweet items. You must try the sparkling Date Juice. The staff even though different to the night before wished me a happy birthday. 

After our huge feast we went back to our room again the butler opened the door and took in more of the opulence for while.  After our rest we proceded down to the pool area ths was very pleasant, pool staff arrange your towels more the umbrellas and bring a clod esky with towels and drinks.  The pool is quite small but very pleasant non the less. Pool staff bring around snacks of popcorn and cold ice lollies. 

That night as we had a very large afternoon tea and had tried all the places to eat we decided to have room service and invite a friend who lives in Dubai.  She was given the third degree on entering our floor by the Butler even though we had advised she was coming, she did feel a little uncomfortable with this but understood as I guess people do try to sneak people in. The room service was extremely disappointing. The food was cold and tasted like it was cooked the day before. This may have just been a bad selection on our part but as the restaurants are so good not sure why the room service lacked lustre.

Breakfast the next day was lovely although hubby did not eat as he was not feeling well not sure if it was the room service of just a tummy bug.  

This was to be our last day which was dissapointing as I really would have loved to stay longer this Hotel will be my choice every time I visit Dubai and hope to stay much longer. Check out went well a little slow and I feel that in your room is probably the better place to check out as this is where you check in.

I would like to say thank you to the Staff at the Burj for my memorabe birthday.

And to ll that made it to the end of my book review well done on selecting the Burj for you next holiday. You will not be dissapointed.","5","2012-08"
"Exceptional staff","We stayed at the BAA for 3 days in early August. Myself and two teenage grandchildren and my friend and her teenage grand daughter.
We have always wanted to stay at  the Burj after staying numerous times in JBH and Madinet and this occasion certainly did not disappoint.
Unlike the London hotels where some staff try to make you feel inferior, the Burj training of staff, I imagine, must impart a mantra of ""no matter who the guests are, they must be treated exactly the same"".
 We were treated like important guests. The butlers and staff on floor 14 were incredibly helpful.  Some of the memories of the Burj will stay in our hearts forever.
 On our leaving day, we were moving over to JBH for 12 nights.As  we were coming down in the escalator and below us looking up was a diagonal  line of ladies dressed in long  gold and royal blue outfits plus men in suits   wating to say goodbye to us.  ( At least we hoped they were there for us, unless somebody really important was behind us. and we stole their thunder)
Congratulations to Mr. Morio for having such a wonderful staff who made our stay so special.","5","2012-08"
"Exceeds all expectations !","You expect the Burj Al Arab to be great and your certainly not disappointed.  We arrived early morning from the UK and were immediately taken to our suite, I don't think this would happen when it gets to their busy season Nov - Mar, but a lovely surprise none the less.  I'm only going to repeat what everyone else says about the staff and management at the hotel, exceptional service and your looked after as though your royalty, which i could get soo used to.......

My only tiny grumble was about the loungers around the pool, and the fact that people were allowed to reserve these and not use them, which happened each day we were there.  I think a policy of reserving them for a couple of hours and then freeing them for others to use if they are still free  -  the pool isn't massive and there's not a huge amount of space around it.  

I love the fact that you get a chill box of bottles of water, ice and cold towels, and these are regularly replenished, but also the ice lollies, fruit kebabs, and glasses cleaning service - well what can you say !!!

Also, i have no idea how the staff know your name, even if they've only met you for the first time !  WOW  brilliant !","5","2012-08"
"What can you say ??? Excellent , amazing, just great fun","We arrived on the early flight from Manchester, thinking we would have to wait until our room was ready, however that was not a problem and were shown to a 2 bedroom suite !!!! Free upgrade.

We only stayed two nights before going on to Al Maha but what a way to start a trip worth every one of our hard earn pennies with great staff and great services.","5","2011-10"
"Amazing","This hotel was amazing.

We booked the Honeymoon Package which had plenty of extras. Although we had difficulty with prepayments and third party authorisations, this was the only negative.

Once we arrived at the airport, we were greeted by Jumeirah staff. We were chauffeured in a Rolls Royce Phantom (which was given as an upgrade for our payment difficulties). Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted and introduced to a variety of staff, including our butler. Our room was very spacious, and absolutely incredible.

As part of our package we also recieved massages, wine, and dinner. The staff were beyond accommodating, especially as we both suffered from severe jet lag. The chef of the sky restaurant personally cooked us a meal to eat in our room because of our sickness. The hotel also provided personal wait staff for the duration of that meal.

In summary, there are only positive comments to make about this hotel. Words cannot describe our experience. We would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a new experience.","5","2012-08"
"Extravagance!!","I think my review title tells it all!! From top to bottom, from ceilings to floor carpets, from door knobs to statues, the people here want to show that they have plenty of dosh, and they want to spend it!! Nice for a day visit or to eat at a restaurant - which we did - but not the kind of place I would like to stay for my holidays!! Yet if extravagance is ""your thing"" then this hotel is the one for you!!","4",
"Astonishing","The Burj al arab is astonishing from outside & inside... in front of the hotel (just infront of the wild wadi waterpark entrance) is the best spot for 1st visitors to take picture with burj !  however when you enter the burj everything is arabic style design.
the bars & restaurants on the top have excellent views to the ocean.","5",
"Amazing","It is visually amazing. great background for photo's. A good spot for admiring the architectural beauty and wonder of the skyline","4",
"Nothing like it...","This was our second time staying at the Burj, and it lived up to our first experience.
Completely over the top the hotel goes all out with everything - the rooms are all 2storey, with huge living spaces and beautiful bathrooms. Some may find it too much, but there is only one Burj al Arab. 
The staff are amazing, and go out of their way to help. 
Both times we went for my husbands birthday, and we've eaten at both restauraunts. The top one is lovely, with excellent food, but the seafood restaurant at the bottom is even better. If you book early enough you can get a table directly next to the fish tank. The hotel staff obviously communicate with the restaurant staff, because both times we've had lovely complimentary birthday cakes come out with dessert.
We have always gone in the middle of summer (July), when thankfully prices are at least half price or more. If you are a UAE resident you can correspond with them directly and get even cheaper prices (which is good, because even at half price it is very expensive).
If you do go in summer when it is 50degrees outside they have an indoor pool which is pretty amazing. 
We've experienced better breakfasts, but that is probably the only fault you could find in this amazing place. 
One of a kind!","5","2012-07"
"Dinner and Drinks","What a hotel!! WOW!!

Honestly, I can see why this is a self styled 7 star hotel. You will simply not visit a hotel elsewhere quite like it! We stayed for dinner and then went to the sky view lounge for drinks. It is extremely expensive but well worth it as a treat.","5",
"Breathtaking","Im surprised at the expense complaints below...Yes, this hotel is very expensive but everyone should realize that before their stay.  We splurged and stayed there for one night and were blown away. The decor is stunning he, the staff was kind and attentive, the rooms were out of this world, and the view was magical. 

The staff always called us by our name and would do anything for us to make our stay more enjoyable. 

The breakfast Buffett was so amazing!! Food from all over the world prepared so beautifully. 

It was worth All of the memories...and would stay there again if we were lucky enough!!","5",

"Greatly improved service","This was our third stay at the Burj Al Arab after a break of several years and the most noticeable change was a marked improvement in service with staff exuding much greater charm. The beach area has been expanded and the Majlis Al Bahar restaurant there served consistently great lunches. Now in its twelfth year, the hotel's decor is holding up surprisingly well with only the occasional fitting betraying the age. The Panoramic Suites are lovely and enormous but beware of the noise of the motorised blinds being opened and closed in adjoining suites. The major drawback of the Burj is the throng of tourists, even if they are hotel guests, taking pictures in the mezzanine level through which you must navigate to reach the lobby each time you wish to leave the hotel.","5","2012-03"

"Best hotel ever","If you like luxury this is the place to go. The hotel is magnificent, rooms are very spacious and comfortable. The services and facilities in the rooms are outstanding. Staff is extremely courteous, and professional. Stayed on the 22nd floor of the hotel (which translates to the 44th and 45th floor in a standard hotel) and had magnificent views of the Palm Jumeirah. Breakfast was the best I ever had. Also appreciated the complimentary birthday cake and in room musician for my birthday. The hotel really lives to its reputation as the most luxurious on earth. Decor might not be to everyone's liking, but it is a must stay hotel, and although very expensive when compared to other hotels, still it has a good value for money.","5","2012-07"
"AMAZING but not great for kids","Me and my Mum and Dad went to go and stay in the Burj Al Arab we were in one of the suites and it was amazing are view looked right into the ocean witch was the most beautiful view we've ever had in a hotel. The breakfast buffet was great,there was a selection of food from all over the world. It was very close to perfection. It was very special we were even picked up in the BMW 7 series. Although the hotel is amazing and the view is beautiful there wasnt much to do for people my age the kids club only catered for children 5 and under there was a pool but i live in pools and soo do many of the people that live there anyway the food was great. But it was more for people for 16 up its more of a relaxing time out. But still amazing","4","2011-11"
"This is the best hotel in the world!","I have been lucky enough to have stayed at the Burj Al Arab 4 times with my wife and family. This is indeed an experience that you will never forget so the price tag is quite high but worth every penny. We have had so many great memory's of the Burj. The attention to detail is second to none and the luxury is overwhelming! It still takes my breath away each time as its design is simply stunning and words cannot describe.

The Burj is made special by the staff and how they pamper your every wish as nothing is any trouble for them. We have found the Burj al Arab child friendly as it can be like a fairy tale for them with the sweet trolley coming round every evening and the surprises that awaits them. My daughters birthday is usually when we are in the Burj and the staff always do something quite special for her. I have had the pleasure of meeting Heinrich Morio the General manager and the CEO mr Gerald Lawless who I believe offer unriveled levels of service in their establishments. You will not find anything like this anywhere else in the world! Thank you for the fantastic experiences we have had and we look forward to coming back. Gerard and Clayre, Ireland","5","2012-07"
"Incredibly close to perfection ...","I travel a lot (sometimes it almost feels like I am travelling for a living) and spent probably 40-50 nights per year in a hotel. Sometimes on budget, sometimes in the most upscale places I can find.

I was fortunate enough to have the chance to indulge for a few nights at Burj al Arab in Dubai and must admit that the stay was very close to perfect: the staff was not only incredibly friendly and efficient, but also seemed to be genuinely warm and caring (never take this for granted or equate the two). 
My suite was gorgeous, well appointed, in perfect condition (both cleanliness, repair and maintenance) and the attention to detail was impeccable.

Undoubtedly one of the top experiences in the world and highly recommendable ...

Looking forward to my return","5","2012-07"
"Fantastic...but not quite as fantastic as it should be","I absolutly recommend a night or two here. It has to be experienced. In the main the experience is 'a million dollars' but then you pay a few to stay here.

There are many things to take your breath away here... food and service are second to none... The only tip i'd give is book when the sun is still soaring....August and early Sept is quiet season and you normally get diner thrown in with a discounted room rate which makes a visit much more worthwhile.

If the nightly rate for this place was more in the normal leagues (for Dubai) then I don't think it would take so much criticism from its reviewers... I'm not going to criticise it because we love the place...but we can understand why people do have negative comments about it.  When you pay £600-900 a night (£500 or more then most places in Dubai a night) then a hotel should be flawless...The Burj Al Arab is not flawless...but its gets pretty close.... It down to the indivdual what price you justify for that experience.

We will go again for sure...probably for a short stay... but if you can get over the cost, you'll love every minute of it!!!","5","2011-09"
"""Most Expensive holiday""","Stayed here for 3 nights and was definitely a nice experience! I surprised my girlfriend and proposed at this hotel! Was definitely a holiday to remember as it was my birthday too! We decided to go shopping and they gave us our own car and driver, we got a 7series BMW. And also got back from shopping the night of my birthday and found a nice cake and a card from the hotel. Was lovely and they also gave me a bouquet of roses :)","5","2011-08"
"Really is the World's Most Luxurious Hotel","Just pure perfection, decandence, luxury!  It's not the world's only 7* hotel for nothing.  You are pampered, spoilt and waited on hand and foot.  We got engaged at the Al Mahara restaurant 4 years ago and we have always wanted to stay for a night so my husband surprised me for my birthday with a nights stay.  So many memories here!!  

From the moment you arrive the service is just amazing, we were escorted up to our huge suite and greeted by our butler, Ming with welcome drinks.  She then gave us a tour of the suite, showing us all the modcons such as the electric blinds and the fact that u can see whoever is ringing your doorbell on the television screen as well!!  We loved Ming, she was so helpful, smiley and friendly and she ran us some amazing jacuzzi baths with huge bubbles in our suite!  We loved all the complimentary treats such as the bathroom products and for my birthday I was sung to by a band in our suite and was given a beautiful bunch of red roses along with a yummy birthday cake!  Was fabulous!!

We then had some birthday drinks with some friends at the Sky View bar and again the service was fantastic.  The view is amazing up there but the bar's decor is a little reminiscent of Star Trek!!  The cocktails are too delicious for words though!!

Only a few things that we would have liked to have seen in a 7* hotel: there was no moisturiser in the bathroom, the music tv was pretty bad - we would have liked to have had VH1 and they shouldn't call you the morning of your checkout, we were ready to leave anyway so we didn't need a phone call.

Overall though, yes we agree with other reviews that it is pricey but it's a must that has to be done on the bucket list!!  Amazing!","5","2012-07"
"Immaculate all the way...","My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights....big mistake we should have stayed for at least 5 nights....the most beautiful experience....from check in to check out every thing was just great...and above all our butlers Anthony, Alina, and Oscar made our stay more memorable....until now las Vegas was our destination for any personal vacation but now burj al Arab will always be our first choice...kudos to the hotel management...","5","2012-07"
"Jaw Dropping!!!","What can I say, it's the Burj al Arab!
My holiday in summer 2011 was pretty much perfect thanks to this hotel. As soon as I walked into the hotel, I was completely stunned by the sheer size of the hotel.
We had the gold package for 3 weeks, and it was amazing! 
Of course I went in the sky lounge for drinks, and it was an awesome expierience.
Of course it was expensive, but it made my summer, and that is what a holiday is meant to do

PERFECT","5","2011-08"
"World class everything","Have you ever seen those older James Bond movies where the villain has a ridiculously ornate and elaborate hideout, and thought to yourself ""I want that"", well; here's your chance. And I mean that in a good way - the Burj al Arab was not designed with subtlety in mind. Everything here is meant to impress you, and impress you is exactly what this place will do.

I had the pleasure of staying here in late June. The service was fantastic, I was greeted at the door (they'll greet you by name because the security guard will verify your identity before crossing the bridge...another welcome feature), check in is handled in your room followed by a thorough tour and explanation of the features by your butler. For dinner, I recommend al Mahara - yes, thats the seafood restaurant with its own aquarium. If you have a date (and both brought your formal attire) this is the place to go. After dinner drinks can be found at the Skyview, which lives up to its name offering a great view of Dubai (even better after dark).

Everything here is expensive and I won't begrudge anyone for walking away when you see the price but; for a once in a lifetime experience, I got what I paid for.","5","2012-06"
"the buffet here at the lobby is good...","it feels a little like a disney aladin theme haha ... ive been here a ew times and ive enjoyed the resturaunts ... and been to the rooms although i havent slept here.. the rooms are where the hotel gets the seven stars ... service is out of this world !!","4",
"Awesome!","This hotel deserves being considered as 7* hotel. Everything was really amasing. Once we checked in, our butler guided us to our suit on the 16th floor. Soon we were offered delicious orange juice and ginger tea that I loved very much and ordered every single day we spent in this wonderful place.
On the first floor you can find a washroom for guests, business zone, mini bar and living room. Mini bar contains either soft and strong drinks, also there are some snacks and menus. All the windows are from the floor to the ceiling, with an amazing view. You can read some magazines, enjoy watching TV(only in English or Arabic), spend some time talking to you guests.
On the second floor you will see the bedroom, bathroom and wardrobe. Bathroom was fairly my favorite part of our suit!!! Enormous, with jacuzzi and shower, large mirror and bath menus. All the amenities are represented in full-sized Hèrmes products(Kelly Caléche for women and Therre d'Hèrmes for men), towels are snow white and very soft.
Bedroom contains King bed with a mirror right above it on the ceiling, mini bar, TV and a remote control for TV and curtains. This was a very nice surprise to find little gifts every night on the bed. 
If you need anything, just ask butlers. There are 2 of them on each floor and they are on call around the clock.","5","2012-04"
"****IF YOU WANT THE BEST****","We stayed here on our stop over to England for 2 nights. First off if you dont want the best service people doing everything they can for you and helping you then DONT stay here. If you want to be left alone and sit in your own room then go and stay in a self catering style hotel. This is the best service you can get anywhere, from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The hotel itself is amazing and i think it looks better at night with the lights on etc.
 We had the full panoramic view suite and it was amazing, I had to do some work there and the complimentary internet was fast and the desk facilities were top notch.The Nespresso machine was a nice touch and was re filled daily (we like coffee).The suite itself was the biggest ive ever stayed in and I have stayed in some big suites- it was huge.The TV system all worked well and we had the ipod set up around the suite.The bathrooms were beautiful (I own a building  Renovation company so know about bathrooms etc) ITS NOT MODERN like ive heard people moan about no automatic taps(like the ones in public toilets)???? thats not the style of the hotel its extravagant GOLD tapware and fittings and they are the best quality, that is what the place is about the best ( i think these people didnt even stay at the hotel).the spa in our bathroom was big and could fit 3 people in easily.The fruit was nice and fresh each morning and it was topped up whenever we eat some.
 THE FOOD- we Eat and drank at sky bar and both enjoyed the experience - there was alot of people who were not guests at the hotel who seemed to take up the best seats (by windows) but we asked to be moved and once a table was available we had it.
The best food was at the Al Mahara (aquarium) the experience was great- the wait staff all spoke to us and were friendly, we even had the head chef come out as we were from Australia and meet us and have a chat. We ordered the 7 course set dinner and my partner was even made some fish off the menu as a substitute for the lamb ( a very nice touch). The food was great and the service was great and the portions were just right.A great evening.
The breakfast was also very good, again the staff are great and very friendly, the selection was good and the fresh eggs etc were nice.The coffee was also decent quality.
** A quick thank you to the staff on our floor they were all great especially Santiago he was a great guy and very helpful.
We will stay again when next in Dubai. Its the best.

  GO ON TREAT YOURSELF.","5","2012-06"
"Man Made Marvel","Man Made Marvel...amazing superrrrrb 7 star hotel...gold plating on the walls is amazing..the suites are like must visit once in a lifetime....lovely commercial & residential place with its own huge beach surrounding the hotel...multiple swimming pools..alomg the beach..u can just hop in & hop off between the pool & the Arabian sea :) :)","5",
"The most luxurious experience!","After so many years deciding which hotel to choose using Tripadvisor I decided to start sharing some of my reviews of the hotels I go to! Burj al Arab will be the first one, because it was without a doubt the most luxury hotel I have ever been! Regarding the service it was outstanding, with checkin being made on our room, and a butler always available on each floor. The room is outstanding, with so much space i felt like i was never taking advantage of everything, because you have 2 floors, the ground floor with a small bathroom, a living room with office (laptop and fax included) and a small cabinet for luggage; and the top floor as a large bathroom with a jacuzzi, a big shower and it´s completed with full size hermes products (including parfums) for you to take when you leave, and also a dressing room and of course, the bedroom. Everything was thought to the smallest details, and you have a TV in your bedroom that ""hides"" when you shut it down. Also, and very usefull, you have a huge remote for the whole room (ipad size), where you can control everything except the lights (which by the way are very well placed. The price is high, of course, but you don´t get that kind of room even when you pay more in other presidential suites of other hotels. The only thing i disliked was the hotels pool bar being closed for the total days we were there, and also when you want to go to the beach or other pools you have to use the golf car, which gives you the feeling of being ""far from you room"" in case you need anything from there, but thats the downsize of being in a small island. By the way, the room is so quiet that i can assure you youll never hear anything!","5","2012-07"
"was mind blowing experince","stay was accelent food n was like heaven and staff who taken care of guest was like angle they have treated  us as angle i really wanna stay fr whole life there  th rooms th pool food every thing was super accelent ","5","2011-08"
"Expected more from a 7star","The rooms were not as oppulent as expected.  The view from the superior restaurant was spectacular, but the windows are a bit dirty, expected them to be cleaner.","3",
"breakfast","wonderfull.elevation,entrance,amenities,lobby ,lifts,interior......every thing is just amazing.best example of luxury money can afford.
ultimate property.warm welcome.you will feel like a king. grand grand feeling.
view from dinning hall was excellent.
2 sports car and 2 rolls royce were standing on the entrance .if you stay there you can enjoy the ride of those cars.","5",
"Glorious over the top luxury","We had just one night at the Burj Al Arab, as our final night in Dubai.  It is, of course, horribly expensive, but something to be done once if you can afford it.  Each room is a duplex, and there are about a dozen on each floor, with a floor butler always available.  Our duplex had a downstairs sitting room, with luggage store and cloakroom.  Upstairs was a bathroom, with double basins, shower and jacuzzi, a dressing room, and bedroom (with mirror over the bed, for those so inclined).  There is a large amount of technology, with control pads everywhere (for curtains, doors, entertainment, etc), plus a laptop and printer.  Various freebies are provided, from mid-afternoon snacks to beachbag and Hermes toiletries.  There are indoor and outdoor pools, and a very well-equipped gym.  Service is excellent (as no doubt it should be for the money).  Just wallow in it.","5","2012-06"
"just to say you've been...........","it looks beautiful from the outside. Once you get to the hotel you can turn around and look back at the beautiful beach and jumeriah hotel (i think?). Inside the decor was not tasteful- i've seen much better 4* hotels! however the lift doors were beautiful. We had afternoon tea in jing sui restaurant- as it was the cheapest, but I wouldn't recommend it!","3",
"Honeymoon at the Burj!","My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Burj at the end of May to celebrate a portion of our honeymoon. To say that we enjoyed our stay at the BAA would be an understatement. We were allowed to check in early, given a comp drink while the finishing touches to our room were being done. Booking with AMEX platinum got us upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite and that was probably overkill..but since this was our honeymoon...
The suite was amazing! Butler service, gold plated fixtures, nice amenities, all great touches. We had dinner at their ritzy resturant and it didn't disapoint. We also visited the spa (courtesy of the AMEX platinum..nice) and I had one the best massages ever. Nice gym too.
The BAA delivered a suprise cake for our honeymoon which was very delicious! They even allowed us to have a late check out of 630pm!!! 
We definetly will return.","5","2012-05"
"Out of the world!","Everythign about this hotel is extra amazing! if you have deep pockets and an appetite to spend, then all you have to do is take a weekend off and go to this hotel, as soon as you enter the lobby, the blue green and white colours brighten your day! The breakfast, rooms, dineer, the sky bar are all places to have a meal at!!","5","2012-02"
"Once in a lifetime experience!","We stayed here for one night on our trip to Dubai. Where to start! You feel like royalty when you approach this hotel. We were warmly greeted and taken to or bedroom. Best views I have ever seen, the 21st fllor if I remember correctly. I had a really bad dose of flu and felt terrible, so much so that the concierge went to the chemist and brought me back medicine! However they excelled yet again. Determined not to have our day ruined we went to the beach, when everyone else was ordering cocktails I ordered some hot honey and lemon. However the lady at the beach bar organised for some to be waiting in our bedroom later that evening upon my return as well. Amazing staff. We ate dinner in the restaurant in the top floor that night, great service, and less fussy than expected. We went for the tasting menu, it wasnt as amazing as expected but still good. That morning we went back to the beach, which is stunning. Later we headed to the Spa which was a fantatsic experience. Overall this was a great 24 hours, even with man flu! The care and attention by the staff was second to none. The decor of the bedroom wasnt to my tatse. The hotel from the front is so visually stunning and modern that I had expected the inside to be the same. Dont get me wrong though it is lovely warm and colourful inside and extremly comfortable as one would expect. We will definately return to this hotel, however one night is too short. It is a once off experience, and for me the best part was lying on their magnificent beach looking up at the hotel. It is simply breathtaking.","5","2012-03"
"Did not age a bit","Although its been a while since this tower hotel was built on an artificial island, its design is still very distinguished, still very beautiful and did not age at all, at least from outside. From inside, its clearly Versace all over the place, which was iconic when Giani Versace was running the business, but not any more. But still, the hotel is grand and is only for the quite capable. Entry is for hotel guests only, and not every hotel offers guests a choice of a Rolls Royse limosines or a chopper, as a ride from the airport.","5",
"Hard to get into and starting to age","The Burj is a iconic building in Dubai, but its very hard to get into with security being very tight. Once inside it is very over the top and the decor is more like something out of Circ De Soleil with rainbow colours spalshing across every wall, carpet and chair. But still worth a visit if you can muscle your way past security. Beware of the food and beverage, which can be rather average and very highly priced.","3",
"Birthday Treat.","Just returned from three nights at the Burj for the wife's birthday treat. Where do you start to say how wonderful this place is. I booked a Summer Dream Package not cheap but definately a dream.  Limo picked us up from the airport, allowed to book in at 0830 (normally 1500). The deluxe suite was something else, upstairs to the Bedroom, Bathroom and Cloakroom. All the staff were excellent, very friendly and willing to attend to your every need. I had orderd a Birthday cake ended up with two (no charge).The wife thought the  Spa treatment was excellent. A very nice touch is that you get to take all the Hermes toiletries home with you. I wanted a perfect Birthday treat for the wife and it was.","5","2012-06"
"Burj al arab","Have been to Dubai now a number of occasions and decided to this time to take the plunge and spend a few quid extra .. just so I could say 'Ive stayed in the Burj'. So we left the brats with their grandmonther and headed off to be spoilt! 
Amazing place from the minute you are personally greeted to the time you leave.
Everything is beautifully done and the suites spread over 2 levels are massive.
We ate in the seafood restaurant one night and the food was outstanding .... loads of it! 

Swimming pool was a bit disappointing (small) but then you have the water park and use of the other 'Jumeirah hotels pools, so it's no big deal.  The Executive pool at the Jumerirah Beah hotel is really relaxing and has a swim up bar.  Its only a short ride on a golf buggy back across the bridge from the Burj and is well worth the 2 minute trip.
One thing I did find irritating was the staff attentiveness.  Whilst it's nice to be spoilt, to be asked on 10 seperate occasions at breakfast  in the space of 20 minutes if I would like more orange juice ... it's just rediculous! Also in room Check in seem to take an age.  There really is no need for your personal butler to spend 30 minutes telling you how the tv,shower works etc.
I guess they're just eager to please.
One good thing though ... our air conditioning broke and it was fixed pretty quickly ... not a good idea to be getting ready for dinner in 40 degree heat.
Overall a fantastic hotel ... would I return .. probably not, but I would recommend a stay just to say you've done it!","4","2011-09"
"OMG!  How spoilt!  Fantastic even with children!","Brilliant, we went for our daughter's 9th birthday and it was just wonderful!  Totally spoilt, relaxed, exhausted-waterpark, kids club, swimming pools everywhere, even 36th floor!  Just wonderful!  Private entrance/exit for hotel guests so you don't have to mix with tourists!  We all loved it.  We ate evening meals at our own dining table and maybe next time I will pluck up the courage to take the children to one of the allowed evening restaurants!  They loved it (9 and 4), we loved it, all happy, all tired!","5","2012-06"
"Service is out of this world","We stayed in Suite 710 in Burj Al Arab Dubai for three days from June 1st to 4th on our way to USA. We enjoyed every moment of it. Our Butler service is prompt and excellent. Aromatherapy Jacuzzi in the suite is the best. We stayed in lot of luxary hotels but nothing to compare to the experience we had at Burj. Everybody has to stay at Burj at least once for the long lasting sweet memories","5","2012-06"
"Pearl of Dubai","You need the booking to go inside, book the hi tea. It's the 7 star hotel. Outside views and inside views both are nice.","4","2011-08"
"Amazing Stay","Staying here for just one night in the middle of a two week honeymoon and WOW how amazing!
The staff treat you so nice! They do anything you want and more!
The food is amazing as is everything else here. Got picked up in a gorgeous car this morning and was given a lovely bunch of flowers and then this afternoon we were given a cake and a card for our honeymoon and another bunch of flowers! 
The suite is absolutely fabulous! It has gadgets for everything! You even get a pillow menu!
You have to experience this once in your lifetime but im hoping i experience it a lot more than that now Im used to this!! haha","5","2012-06"
"tacky","too much bling bling, a lot of goldish items, overdone. Service is good though but it's just too tacky for my taste
building is yet iconic and it’s beautiful from the outside but I won’t opt to stay there. It’s good for a quick visit and / or the beach","3",
"Extravagance - Over the Top","Burj Al Arab is no doubt a Seikh's palace in Dubai. Fit for a sheikh and for those who have similar tastes. The hotel is over-the top in every detail. One needs to have similar tastes to enjoy this hotel. The opulence of gold, and the use of extremely bright colors might put you off. The rooms are the best of what is available anywhere in the world, sophiticated but gaudy on color. Restaurants are supremely fine, especially their underground restaurant - we had dinner while the fishes were swimming past us. The entry to this restaurant is also very dramatic - a virtual submarine ride takes you to this treasure. Similarly the bar on the top floor is too good, amazing view and superb cocktails. This bar houses the World's most expensive Cocktail!!

Burj Al Arab is made to splurge and splurge over-the-top you will do. Exclusivity is supreme and the architecture of the hotel cannot be described in words, its an engineering marvel and blows one off completely.","4","2011-07"
"Amazing hotel","Just had an amazing stay at this wonderful hotel, Paul, our personal butler, was fantastic nothing was too much trouble for him and his team.  Would love to take the kids next time but it is expensive however the attention to detail sets this hotel apart from others.  The suite was the best I've ever seen, set out over 2 floors with stunning views over the beach and marina. The poolside staff were very good, the ice box full of bottled water, iced cloths and facial water sprays were an excellent touch as were the fruit kebabs!  Not keen on the mirror above the bed though!","5","2012-06"
"best hotel in world!!!","We enjoyed our stay in this hotel because they treated us like a royalty. Our fabulous suite was overwhelming. Its amazingly huge. The suite has 2 levels the bedroom and toilet and bath are all spacious and the family room down is big and all well equip. Its really to die for, wish to stay there longer though. Thanks for  wonderful experience","5","2011-08"
"Best service, great views","I try to stay away from big hotels, but this one I had to try.

We checked into a two bedroom suite, very spacious two levels, with the bedrooms upstairs and an office, family room, living room, dinning room, full kitchen and more restrooms downstairs. 

There is a concierge on every floor to help you with reservations, suggestions and arranging for any activities you would like to do. 
In the bathrooms you can find Hermes perfumes, body wash, deodorants, after shave, body lotion, etc. They were not the usual hotel sizes, but the same sizes you would buy at the stores.
I found the decoration not to be my style, bright colors (and every color), busy and lack of sense of design. More expensive does not always mean better.
The master bedroom has a huge mirror over the bed, I asked if the could remove it and they did put some cover on it, I guess I was not the only one.
We had a great view of the bay, except for the smoggy sky, that is beige in color or grey,  you can see the sun shinning trough a cloud of dust.
I can't say that is worth the money they charge, but now I can say:  been there done that!
You can find much nicer hotels in Dubai, but if you like big hotels, you will like it.","4","2012-04"
"We love the Burj","Have written many reviews now on this fab hotel and still cannot describe how it feels to be a guest there without trying for yourself. Sad to leave again as I think my wife was emotional saying farewell to Mr Himal and think he knew also. Had a fab suite with a full size snooker table which has to be seen to believe. Our suite was decked out so beautiful by Nehza and her team as always and wish her all the best for the future. Our butlers Steven and Martin did an excellent job as usual. Only let down was the cake we asked to be delivered to our jewellers in the JBH never arrived. The Al Iwan restaurant came up trumps the nights we dined and many thanks to Chef Mohammed who takes the time to make sure we are looked after so well as does the othe Mohammed...
The pool staff are so efficient as are the great door staff who now know us well.
Finally another big thanks to Nimal who goes beyond that extra mile..or two for us each time.","5","2012-05"
"Incomparable luxury!","We stayed here just one night and we were treated like royalty!  They upgraded us and gave us fruits and chocolates and roses because we were on our honeymoon.  The room itself was the Panoramic Suite.  It was set over two levels with huge floor to ceiling windows offering a wonderful view of Jumeirah beach, along with beautiful furniture and the choice of mattresses and pillows.  There were also two bathrooms with superior toiletries, two lounges and even a small bar area where you could entertain guests.  We chose to have breakfast at Junsui and it was the best hotel breakfast I've ever had.  There are four sections offering excellent quality food from all over the world.  The staff are exceptional and they are a quick phone call away.  It was a wonderful experience and I would say, even though the price was very high, I would definitely consider staying here again.  It is not so close to the city centre so you need a taxi to get anywhere but the beachside location is very pleasant indeed!  In summary, it is impossible to compare this to any other hotel.  It is a destination, an experience and a place where you can feel like a celebrity and enjoy such elegant luxury in true comfort and class with exceptional service!","5","2012-04"
"Opulence.  Burj Al Arab has it.","Wow.  This hotel is completely over the top when it comes to luxury.  If you want to know what royalty is like, stay a couple of nights at the Burj Al Arab.

We booked a Panoramic Suite, and I must say that I thought it was worth the extra money.  You get HUGE windows and a corner room with stunning views.  Our room felt like a fuul apartment.  We had a full executive desk with computer, printer, stationary and conference phone.  There is a half bath/powder room downstairs (the full bathroom was upstairs) as well as a luggage room.  There is a bar with three stools, a 4 person table and chairs for dining, and a full living room.  The bedroom and full bath are upstairs, and a full double closet.

Everything is completely trimmed out in gold, full plush carpet, intricate designs, mosaics, just absolutely over the top.  It is truly the only of its kind.

Each floor has its own butler that is there 24 hours a day to greet you when you get off the elevator.  We used the butler to book excursions, make dinner reservations and give suggestions on Dubai.  The service was phenomenal.  And a proper butler (in tuxedo, no less) came by each afternoon with snacks and was also available to draw a bath, etc.

The technology in the room needs a little updating.  The TVs are a bit dated.  They took a great amount of care to include a very intricate control  system on a touch pad for the curtains, TVs, stereo, lighting, etc.  This is all good, but just needs to be brought up to date.

We also did the culinary flight and experienced 5 of the restaurants in one night.  I highly recommend this; it isn't cheap, but it's a worthwhile endeavor.  You start with a cocktail up top at Sky Bar, then have a first course (beef tartare, oysters, etc.) at Al Muntaha.  The second course at Al Iwan was actually my favorite.  This is the Arabic restaurant, and my Morroccan lamb soup was unforgettable.  The third course at Junsui was also fantastic.  This is the Japanese restaurant that was honetly the most ""current"" restaurant of the bunch.  It was nicely appointed and felt contemporary.  The Wagyu beef maki roll was delicious.  The main course in Al Mahara is great.  We both had the lobster, which we enjoyed while observing a massive aquarium full of sharks, sting rays, parrot fish and even a Napoleon wrasse.  You finish the evening at the Sahn Eddar lounge.  This is the ""tea lounge"" that overlooks the main bay of windows in the elevated lobby.  We had two wonderful desserts with cognac and a sweet sauterne.

Our breakfast was included in the room rate.  You can go to Bab Al Yam or Junsui, or even order room service.  We did Bab Al Yam on the first morning and it was OK.  We did room service on the second morning and it was great.  I would skip the restaurants for breakfast and do room service.

Overall, this place is pure luxury.  Great service from start to finish, and felt like royalty during our stay.","5","2012-06"

"7 star luxury","Once in my life I felt like royalty...Arrived at airport given flowers by the driver, arrive at the hotel greeted by door staff and given cold towelettes and delicious dates upon arrival at door of hotel. Escorted up to our floor by lovely hostess. Shown our room by our gracious butlers (2 on each level) of who organised everything from restaurant/spa bookings, exchange of currency to booking hire cars & had the ability to book tours as well. Wonderful treats like welcome red wine and water plus extra generous Hermes bathroom products! Easily worth $$$. The building is so visually extravagant from the artitecture to the views of the sea in our room. Visit the spa which has their swimming pool ( one mixed) & the rest for men and women only. Make sure you take a ride on the glass elevators up to sky bar for a panormaic view of the ""islands of the world""+ general view of attractions of Dubai.
On reading the travelers reviews I wish we had done the culinary flight. :( and I believe the water park opposite the hotel at wadi wadi which is complimentary would have been great fun but no time argh...
The only thing i found slightly disappointing that the restaurants & alcahol are very expensive for the quality but to make up for that the staff were amazing ( my husband requires gluten free menu) we mentioned to the butler at our first meeting . We walked into any booked restaurant by the butlers he was attended to by the staff in each restaurant of which foods he could eat & if not adquate selection was there the chef would bring him other selections from the other restaurants. The difference between this hotel any other hotel is the customer service and care given by all the al burj staff which exceeds any level imaginable and I believe cannot be matched anywhere else.","5","2012-05"
"Emotional","I was very sad to leave and had tears in my eyes as I shook the hand of Mr Hilal saying goodbye and think he felt my emotion too....has a truly grand suite with the snooker table on the 20th floor. My spa treatment by Cora and Sao was very professional. Inden at the pool kept us refreshed.our butlers Martin and Steven did a great job and did the doormen. Our room was decorated to a high standard by the lovely Nezha and wish her all the best. The 2 Mohammed's in Al Iwan are always so kind. Lastly Nimal you do a fantastic job and a big thank you. There is value for money at the Burj and expect to pay highly for alcohol. I will not be doing another review on the Burj because I personally know it cannot get better for us.","5","2012-05"
"Thousands night and one night.","The hotel is in a artificial island made for this amazing hotel. The luxe is the must of all hotel, the rooms are great and the room service available 24/7 is the easiest thing to make your dreams come true. The only thing is that everything as a cost. And to be onest is not very cheap. Suggested for honeymoon.","5",
"Excellent service","A fantastic time at this hotel where service was unlike anything we have encountered. From the flowers for my wife on arrival to the child slippers and robes for the kids, they think of everything. 

The suite was beautiful although the stairs could be an issue if you have mobility issues or are easily tired after a long flight however the fact that they gave us a suite on arrival at 6am impressed us as the normal check in time was much later. Of course they did advise this depended on availability but having a room ready on arrival that early was a great start to our stay.

The concierge service was great as you would expect.

The only minor issue we had was at the Bab Al Yam for dinner where the waitress did not seem to believe that the dinner meal was part of our package, and after checking three times, finally agreed to fix the bill then promptly charged us 40 dirham for an orange juice as apparently these were not included. It detracted from an otherwise perfect experience. 

Breakfast in the room was spectacular with the service, food and presentation was one of the best we have ever experienced. My wife enojoyed her own private yoga class after breakfast which she thoroughly enjoyed.

Beds were excellent and they even offered to change the pillows and mattress if we felt any of these were unsuitable. That's customer service.

I highly recommend staying at this hotel at least once.","5","2012-05"
"Very nice!!","Spend one night here at burj al arab, as a part of a trip back home from south asia!(july 2008,not 2011)
I travelled with friends, and we did choose a 360m2 suite..wich i believe is a medium size suite!
We was 5 persons staying there, and it was a pleasure. 
It was a little overwhelming at first, but nothing i couldnt get used to:)  Absolutely outstanding rooms, with impressive mosaik tiles, gold paint etc. 
Service was very good, and staff was helpful and nice. We also got a sightseening iside hotel.
In evening we did order some food up to the room, and it was actually pizza :)  Since all resturants in the hotel needed us to dress up in suits..we didnt bother to eat there. 
But we eat breakfast in normal clothes..and breakfast buffet was great. 
Pool area outside was the only area wich wasnt up to top notch, but still it was nice, and the atmosfer was more loose and playful. Quite nice for parents with children!
We also spend time at the beach outside hotel area..and it was a very nice beach for sure...but it was few people there. Maybe because it was 38 C degrees in water...so cooling down in the water was impossible ;)
But waiters at beach did bring us cold water, waterspray, and new towels all the time, all included ofcourse.
We also did visit the waterpark nearby, and it was free entry for us. And we got transported to/from waterpark in golfcars from hotel.  
Waterpark was nothing exiting for adults, but okey for kids:)

All in all it was a great place to stay...but ofcourse on the expensive  side.

If i remember right, i have some prices:  Breakfast about 60$, pepsi from minibar about 10$.
But in a place like this its actually okey, and fully expected.  
If i get the chance, ill stay here again:)","5","2011-07"
"Opulence Plus in a Gross array.","What a Beautiful Hotel not my style at all but worth a visit its quite Grotesque in its over spending on tasty but Expensive furniture fittings and fixtures , The service was 6 star the Hotel amazing I just wish I had booked a night to truly soak up the gross expensive  fittings","5",
"Best Hotel Stay of my Life","We decided to break up our long arduous flight from NYC to the Maldives by stopping off in Dubai for a few days before heading to our main destination. I have to say that I'm not sure if this was a good idea as we had SUCH a wonderful time in The Burj al Arab that we did not want to leave. 

To start, my husband and I may have had the best service of anywhere we have ever received. From the moment you walk in the large doors you are treated like royalty. We had to check in early (9:30am) and they accommodated us immediately without any reluctance. We were ushered in, given a cool drink, refreshing towels, and delicious dates. Then we were taken up to our room where we were introduced to one of our two butlers. He checked us in and then were given a tour of the facility and our bags were offered to be unpacked for us. The safe was impressively large which we appreciated as often times safes in high end hotels are not ample enough. Our toiletries were wonderfully lush, the tub large and great for a romantic bath with your partner, and the pillow menu was extensive. The bedspread is even made up of feathers from a bird that plucks them itself (i'm serious)! Our butler was so sweet and we truly felt that he wanted to make our stay pleasant, rather than a lot of hotel butlers who you meet when you check in and then never see again the whole time you are staying at the resort. 

Our room was spectacular with a view of the palm islands. Being as they are man made, there really isn't anything like that view anywhere else on earth. We had a guest bathroom and large first and second floor. The console which controlled all the devices in the room was easy to use and really a wonderful tool to use when you were curled up in bed relaxing. 

Our butler brought us a new treat every morning and night, which was a wonderful surprise. The location was great and you could always catch a cab whenever you wanted to explore the town (you didn't have to take the expensive Phantom unless you wanted to). We made use of their private beach and enjoyed the solitude of the gulf. They had an amazing spa and complementary yoga classes. The pool for both the women and men was stunning with a view over different sides of the hotel. Again, the gym for both the women and men was very large and well equipped (women are allowed to use either facility, men are not allowed in the women's gym or spa area however).

If you stay here (or even if you're just in Dubai), I recommend doing the culinary flight. We enjoyed this feature that the hotel offered. It allows you to eat in every restaurant the hotel has by doing a course in each restaurant. You start at the sky bar enjoying a drink, then you move on to the restaurant adjacent to it, then the indian for the next course, then japanese, then seafood, etc. It's such a cool experience and the progression of courses really works wonderfully as does the excitement of the evening. Again, here you are treated like a VIP, having the manager of each restaurant escort you to the next place to eat while chatting with you the whole way.  

The only negative we experienced was that they were doing their annual fire alarm test the morning we left. It was unfortunate that we had to be there when it happened but we understood that it had to be sometime and we just were there the wrong day. The staff very much made up for it and let us know that it was going to happen before it did. The only problem was the TV didn't work during this time. 

Overall, I was expecting this hotel to be more hype than substance, but I was completely incorrect- it truly is 7 stars and worth every penny of the exorbitant price. I really can only rave about the burj al arab from the service, to the amenities, to the opulence, to the luxury- we had a perfect experience. We are going to go back as soon as we can and for staying as long as possible.","5","2012-02"
"An experience to remember","This was our second stay at the Burj Al Arab. Our first stay was for only one night and we felt that we missed out on many of the experiences that the hotel had to offer. For our second stay, we opted to stay 3 nights so that we could experience all the hotel had to offer - the bar, restaurants, pool, spa and gym. I even arranged for an in suite dinner with another couple. I worked with the hotel staff for a couple of days to arrange the perfect evening. It was indeed a night to remember and one that we are still talking about. The other reviewers have described the hotel, the service and the rooms in detail. Yes, it's opulent, decadent and not always 100% (the breakfast was not the fine point) but it's something that you will not likely forget.  If you can afford to stay here, this hotel is an experience and one that you will talk about for years to come.","5","2011-10"
"Super Luxury....with a commercial twist","We stayed at this hotel because of its iconic status, not expecting to like it, but wanting the experience.  Our stay was much better than anticipated, but there were a few things that rankled, particularly for the price.  

Beginning with the room,  it was opulent and not as garish as I was led to believe.  The suite was blissfully quiet, we had a beautiful view of the Madinat and Palms and a very comfortable bed.  Ours was a two bedroom suite, that had two very large sitting rooms on the first floor and two luxe sleeping rooms on the second level.  It was a pleasure to spend time in these rooms, and they measure up to the price point.  It must be mentioned, however, that all of the rooms are duplexed and that approx. 20 steps are involved in going up and down, which might be a consideration for some.

The service and hospitality level varied - and it shouldn't at this price point.  The staff, for the most part, is lovely and it was fun to meet people from all over the world, as this property has a very diverse group of employees.  That said, the service was not as standardized as expected, with some staff members warmer and more competent than others. 

A butler sits at the end of the hall, and there were many different people in that role during our stay, so we never had a particularly personal connection.  Our most disappointing experience involved check out.  The official time is noon and our tour was scheduled to return closer to one, so we asked the butler if we could stay an extra hour.  This is not the most unusual of requests, and - as the hotel was not at capacity (60%) - and we had stayed for 3 nights, it should have been a no brainer.  Nevertheless, bureaucracy kicked in and our butler told us he would have to check with his manager.  He did not get back to us that day, other than to request a copy of our voucher for some reason.  24 hours later we still had no idea if our request was granted, so our tour operator called on our behalf and got another run around, but ultimately we prevailed.  Our butler still did not tell us that this big one hour request was granted until we asked him.  When we arrived back in the room at 12:15 on check out day, our key had been deactivated (not a problem as the butler can open the door) and all of the fruit had been removed, so we couldn't even have a last minute banana.  There was this overwhelming sense of the hotel trying to get guests out of the room.  For example, two days before we left we had a letter about departure procedures and the butlers asked several times about our plans to leave.  This lack of hospitality has no place in a hotel at this price point.  By way of contrast, at Al Maha, we were told immediately upon our arrival that they would be happy to extend our stay for two hours.

Because this hotel is a tourist attraction, one must be prepared for lots of people taking pictures in the lobby.  Busloads come in for meals and it can feel very tacky at times.  This  goes away, however, once the resident floors are reached.  As well, the commercial aspect leads to many buffets.  Other than room service, guests have to eat breakfast buffets.  They were actually very good, but I would have liked a sit down ala carte option.

The gym was excellent and there is also a squash court available.  We did not use the spa, but a range of services is available.  Guests are also welcome to use the Wild Wadi water park at no cost and can also be taken to the Madinat resort next door.

The lobby is absolutely beautiful and unique.  All of this comes at eye popping prices.  Despite some disappointment with service, we would stay here again.","4","2012-05"
"7 stars hotel","We stay in a  small suite for the hotel standard, which was on  two floors, probably 160 m2, decorated in a very opulent style , in night blue and gold shades. It was just breath taking. We had our own butler. 
All the products in the bath room are by Hermes  soap, perfumes., Terre d'Hermes for him and Kelly for her.... all real size. We discover every night some gift in the suite. I specially enjoy the delicious box of date.

The  weak point: we were not very impressed by the breakfast  and too many people being let in he hotel who are not staying, taking pictures.","5","2011-06"
"Burj Al Arab - The Best ?  John Pond Review","My wife and I decided to break up our flight from Europe with a couple of nights at the Burj Al Arab, part of the Jumeirah Group, rated as the World’s only 7 star hotel. This top of the line hotel appears to be full most of the time, proving there is demand for super luxury, whatever the price.  

On arrival we were escorted to our two storey suite by an elegant Supervisor who took care of all the check in requirements in our fully equipped office in our suite. We were introduced to our butler, who offered to unpack our bags - what a great start. We climbed the stairs to our enormous bedroom that had floor to ceiling glass walls overlooking Dubai and the Gulf. 

Words can hardly describe the opulence and comfort of this suite, the only problem was it was so outstanding we hardly left the room, sorry suite.

The property has many restaurants serving a wide variety of food and rare wines. We ate one night in the fusion Asian buffet (around $100 pp) excluding beverages.  Although a buffet, many dishes were cooked to order and naturally the service was 7 star.

I believe that staying at a fine hotel can make a vacation even more memorable.  Often long after I have forgotten the local sights, I still remember outstanding hotels and meals that usually are out of the ordinary.

Staying at Burj Al Arab is an experience I will long remember. Price deals can be found online from around $2000 per night. Iss it worth it? I will be talking about this hotel for a long time to come....  John Pond.","5","2012-05"
"If you want to spend on your holiday in a luxurious hotel room then that's perfect choice for you","I loved the room and the view and the service but that's it.

"100 star hotel is the only way to describe this IF clarity Diamond","ummmmmmm,

where do i start from......................well i guess i could say this hotel was really like visiting another planet. it was simply OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

The hotel is located on its own private island. 
You walk in and are greeted by a few staff members smiling and offerring you refreshments yes right at the door. Thats typical middle eastern hospitality though. The lobby is a site to behold. Marble flooring with and impressive water feature casscading water up into the air. 

It seemed to also be very quiet which is perfect if you wanted to have a relaxing peacful stay.
you are personally escorted to your room and are taught about all features .
Beautifully decorrated in classic quality furnishings.

The bathroom is all tiles and ceramics with gold leaf trimmings.
They had a selection of world famous purfumes and colognes to be used at your disposal.
The fridge was stocked with only the finest champagne
the view was like nothing else i ahve ever seen of the city and sea
I only spent one night here it was a stop over on my way to Beirut i wanted to experiance it just for a day and it BLEW MY MIND AWAY.

I could write about this hotel for hours. 
I have stayed in some of the worlds best hotels but Burj Al Arab will forever be the number one hotel on my list.

I will say it was the most expensive hotel room i have ever stayed in till date but man was it worth it. I would encourage evry person to spend a night here just  for the experiance.

Thank you so much for the incomparable service and hotel that is Burj Al Arab i will never forget my stay here for as long as i live.

"It's opulent. Exactly as expected.","I had one night to spend in Dubai, and I thought, why not?
My only complaint was my butler barging in without waiting for me to answer the door. Not that I mind someone bringing me complementary champagne, it was just a bit odd. That said, the customer service is a huge part of the BAA experience. It really was an amazing stay, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating not only to myself, but my friends who were not staying with me. There had been a huge sand/rain storm the night before and so the windows were unfortunately dirty. It was difficult to admire the view, which is already impacted by the haze. Even after we had checked out, since we still had the rest of the day in Dubai before we departed, we were able to use the beach, water park, and spa facilities for the entire day. For the experience (and bragging rights I suppose), it was worth the price.

I cannot comment on breakfast, since we ate at Bab Al Yam, located outside the hotel next to the pool. Breakfast was excellent but it was not included in the price of the room.","4","2012-04"
"Back Again...and Loving every minute of it....","Changed form the Emerites Towers to the Burj mid trip for convenience...have stayed here before...its really hard to compete with this property...the accomodate ""everything"" for you...no request is to small or large...they also coordinate will with their sister hotels....

it is very private and discreet and the staff likes to form relationships with each guest so as to anticipate your next visit....

Rooms are amazing...and the Fullsize Herme's bathroom products are great :)

TV has an amzing varity of TV and Movies for you to choose from... Room service has a  fantastic menu and they make sure to profile your preferences so if you repeatedly order the same thing for breakfast it will be listed and all you have to do is say..:what i had yesterday""... you can try things from many different cultures or ask them to create something from your own memory :)

lobby has some great watch stores so you will never be bored...you are accross from the beach club and water park so plenty to do during the daytime..

the Butlers are awesome ... BTW  you can actually request a specific Butler if you are more comfortable with a particular individual...if you have the oppurtunity the following Butlers would definately make your stay amazing.. Julieta and Feroz...i am sure that ""all"" of the Butlers would provide a steller experience i just happen to have the privlidge of utilizing the services of these 2 and have never been disappointed...also the Guest Services Mgr Rabah Hamadi is extremely accomodating and will do whatever necessary to make your stay an even better experience....  i hope you will enjoy this property as much as i always have     Regards","5","2012-04"

"A short stay in luxury","The service is wonderful as are the in house restaurants.  We stayed there one day tried the dinner buffet and the complimentary breakfast buffet.  You are definitely pampered, but that is no surprise considering the price.  Although the price of a night is steep, you can visit for high tea and possibly have dinner without breaking the bank.  You can not visit just to see the site unfortunately.  
Although we tried a number of rated restaurants in Dubai during our week there, the hotel's buffet was far better.  Of course there are no doubt other fine restaurants in Dubai, we just did not find them.  
This is a smallish hotel with limited activities, you won't find the energy nor the shows of a Las Vegas megaplex such as the Bellagio, but you will be pampered far more.  From the guard at the gate, limiting entry only to registered guests or persons with reservations, to our room with marble staircase from the ground floor to the bedroom area, from the butler who will unpack you suitcases, to sign in which was a couple of complimentary drinks while management took care of the rest, the experience was just that.
When you arrive at your room you discover a complimentary bar, fresh fruits, a box of stuffed dates, and a large assortment of deserts.  Every room has its own business office with computer, printers, fax and various other ""necessities"".  Of course there are a number of televisions but why bother when the view is so wonderful.  My wife was impressed with the full line of Hermes bathroom products.  These were not the typical one night toiletries, but instead a large variety of full size offering.","5","2011-05"
"Amazing!","We had the opportunity to enjoy Easter brunch on Good Friday at the Burj. It was amazing. I have never seen so much food presented so beautifully at a brunch. The dessert table was to die for. The view from the restaurant is incredible. I enjoyed it more than the view from the Burj Khalifa. The service was impeccable, and there was live music to enjoy, as well.This is a beautiful structure and interesting design. An unforgettable experience for sure.","5","2012-04"
"Gorgeous","A truly stunning building, well worth a look, however you cannot enter the property unless you have a reason, eg a booking.  We had dinner and was nice, you can also go for afternoon tea.  You must be wearing long trousers for men and a jacket.","5",
"Glossy hotel...good if u feel like splurging","All gold and shine.......spend the dollars like it was being printed in your backyard. Top class service and amenities. Live like a sheikh or a texas oil millionaire.......fancy hotel, worth a visit even if for a day","4",
"An astonishing tea","We went there to have what they call” High Tea”, at seven o’clock in the evening. When seated, they gave us a menu and told us we had to choose one cocktail and the coffee or tea we preferred. But, nobody came to take the order. Instead, we were served a glass of sparkling wine and some sandwiches. 
 Still having half of the sandwiches, we had run out of wine and swallowing became a bit difficult. The waiters were cleaning and going to and fro, every time looking at our table and seeing our cups empty, we were not served, though. Finally, tired of waiting, we had to call the waiter over and ask for some more wine, but, surprisingly we were told we had to pay an extra charge for some more (In a, so called, seven stars hotel, and, for a simple sparkling wine that ,even if it was high quality, it was not Champagne)
We were also said we had the cocktails, but, when we complained because nobody had, actually, come and taken the order, they realized they had forgotten. It took the waiter a while to bring us the famous cocktails. 
 The second dish were scones, with cream, jam and marmalade, but no tea came. Again we had to call a waiter and ask whether we were expected to have the scones without drinking. Yet again it took a long time for the tea to came, and when we finally had it, the scones were cold.
 The third dish were pastries, but, as nobody was paying attention to us, we had, once again, to ask for some more tea, and when they brought  the new teapot, inside there was only half a cup?! 
When we were nearly finishing something astonishing happened: While we were still having our food a man appeared with a mop and, in front of us, he began mopping the floor??!! I had never, never! seen such a thing: people having tea, and someone mopping the floor at the same time! Disgusting! I asked a waitress about that and she told me the place had to be clean for the next client. I don’t know how other hotels manage to be clean, but I had never seen before cleaning a floor while people were eating.
In short, the worst service we have ever had in a tea, and, we had have tea in many places, such as Harrods, The Balmoral Hotel, in Edinburgh,  The Merrion Hotel, in Dublin, La Duree, in Paris and London, The Ritz Hotel, in London etc.
Of course, the food and drinks were high quality products, the cutlery and trays were made of silver and the crockery was made of porcelain, besides, most of the time three or four musicians were playing some beautiful music. Nevertheless, it was the terrible service and the short of the portions that surprised us so much, for such a good hotel.","3","2012-04"
"TOP of the TOP - we swam in the ocean of hospitality!","Hello to all Tripadvisor Members and Visitors! 
Today is my first review and I am hapy to start it with one of the best hotel - Burj Al Arab, Dubai.

Me and my husband just back from there - where from 18 to 19 April celebrated birthday of my husband. 
We sure prepared for the trip - informed the hotel in advance about the special occasion. As per our experience of 5* hotels - we expected ""special treatment"" for birthday celebration.
But what we got - we did not imagine even in our ""best dreams""! 
All started from the entrance - 3 hosts on your right are waiting to greet you with fresh towels, local sweets and arabic coffee, 2-3 managers on the left are coming to greet and congratulate your arrival. 
All is fast and efficient with luggage and with trip to your room - we just found ourselves in a fantastic suite 1212 to realize that we got an Upgrade! Check-in process is fully taken by the hotel.
The surprises however were not finished: after a trip with our personal butler Mr. Hari around the Panoramic suite (225 sq.m) we got an unexpected Happy Birthday song with guitar from 6 or 7 hotel members. I will add to this a lot of flowers, bottle of wine and champagne, birthday cake, chocolates, strawberries and personal birthday cards ... 
We asked for the visit of the hotel that was professionally organized by super guest service manager Miss Rachelle David. 
In the evening we continued the celebration by experiencing the Culinary Flight with wine - great experience of tasting food from all restaurants of the hotel. Worth the money we paid. Not only because of quality of food and wine, but also of the concept - how smooth and comfortable the whole dinner in 5 different restaurants is organized, how fast and efficient each manager of the restaurant accompanied us. I was absolutely impressed by the huge rose bouquet received at the end of the dinner and my husband was just blown off by one more birthday cake and birthday song to finish our ""flight"".
Speaking about the hotel - the decoration and colors are flashy - the ones attracting and grapping your attention. This hotel was build to impress - well it achieved the Goal. A lot of gold, rich colors. In suites you will find a lot of modernity and gadgets - all equiplment starting from TV and finishing by curtains are controlled by one touch of the button on the screen of your control pannel - cool!!!! You may like or dislike the style of the hotel - but nobody would deny that it impresses.
Speaking about staff and services - I did not see so well educated and flexible staff - as if they read your personality and tell you what you want to hear and behave the way you expect and you need. Bravo! 
We personally felt so much at ease and comfortable. 
We like to discuss with people and we got absolute reflection of same attitude from all hotel members - no matter if from waiters or managers. 
You feel there  as the Special guest, the Very Important guest. 

Special thanks to Mr. Florian Ray (from Al Mahara restaurant) - he is very cool!!!, thanks to Mr. Hari (our butler), and hotel manager Mr. Ammar Hilal (very professional attitude).
I sure recommend the hotel.
It is high priced  (average price per night is around USD 2000) - but worth the Concept they represent. The concept of The Top Luxury and The Top Privacy.","5","2012-04"
"Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Everyone should experience this once in their lives!!!","No words can describe the exceptional service and welcome you receive when staying at this true 7 star hotel. We have been very fortunate to have stayed in the burj on numerous occasions but our recent visit has most definitely surpassed all previous stays. 

Having stayed 8 nights at the Atlantis we spent the last week of our holiday at the burj. What a treat!!! We had a rolls Royce pick us up from the Atlantis to take us to the burj. Wow! The welcome we received on arrival to the hotel was amazing, we felt like we were returning home and felt like part of the royal family. 

Our floor butler,paula was superb and the best butler we have ever had. Especially the way she delt with the demands of our 8 year old daughter. 

The service in al muntaha and bab al yam were exceptional. Each morning at bab al yam we were greeted by our names and given our usual requests of pork sausage, bacon, hp sauce and newspaper. The staff even offered to go to the buffet to get our breakfast..true 7 stars...

The amenities by the poolside has improved, you now receive a cool box full of ice with bottles of water, flannels and facial spray. You are also given caramelised nuts and then constant treats every hour. I would like to thank the chef who especially made sweet popcorn for my daughter who didn't like salted popcorn!!!

Most of all we would like to thank Sebastian who has looked after us during each stay. His personal attention Has been outstanding and we always look forward to seeing him during each visit. Our daughter adores him!

We would like to thank all of the management team and staff for their outstanding personAl service, attention to detail and for contributing to a perfect vacation. 

We look forward to returning in the near future.","5","2012-04"
"One of the must see spots in Dubai","I was truly impressed by its exterior and interior design. I’m impressed by how creative the designers are! It looks absolutely superb, as the shape of a standing boat on the sea. When the moment you walked in Burj Al Arab, you could feel how stunning the interior is! The dancing fountains at the square is amazing! I kept watching it for a while, I adore how beautiful the rhythm made by the dancing fountains! Staffs here are very friendly and initiative to interact with visitors. We had visit the Junsui Pure Asia restaurant (if you wanna know more about the price and stuffs, see my other post of Junsui restaurant) in Burj Al Arab. It was sucha nice and memorable experience. 

Burj Al Arab, I believe it is a must visit spot in Dubai. Its exterior design is already outstanding, creative and attractive enough to make you come for a picture!

Information to visitors: It is advise to make reservation before visit. Since some areas are forbidden to enter if you are neither dining nor staying overnight in Burj Al Arab.","5",
"BURJ AL ARAB, THE ULTIMATE EMOTIONAL AND LUXURY EXPERIENCE EVER !!!","Believe me, my wife and I are used to travel to the Best Hotels and Palaces in this world for our pleasure, but the experience of celebrating my 43rd birthday in Burj Al Arab was the ULTIMATE ONE !!! 
Thanks to the General Manager of the Hotel, Mr Heinrich Morio and the excellent Hotel Manager Mr Ammar Hilal, we were presented an unexpected and wonderful birthday present : an upgrade into the Panoramic Suite number 1212, 12th floor, 225 square meter ! Once we were in our Suite, a group of 6-7 staff members came with a guitar and started to sing me the Happy Birthday song which touched me the most in my life as it reached the bottom of my heart. It became emotional from this minute. A birthday cake, a bottle of champagne Louis Roederer, chocolates, a bottle of red wine and strawberries, all was ready for a personalized welcome as I never saw before.
Later on, our great Butler, Mr Hari, presented us the Suite and how to use the one & only remote control which is dealing with all the Suite amenities (lights, TV, curtains, radio, DVD, etc.), which took easily 20-30 minutes. 
We had a special request to make a visit of the Burj Al Arab, including the Royal and Presidential Suite. This was performed with an incredible high class of service, by the smilling, listening, friendly and efficient Mrs Rachelle David, the Guest Services Manager. In the evening, at 7pm, we started our awesome and once in a lifetime culinary flight experience in Skyview Bar with a cup of champagne Louis Roederer. It consists of a dinner in 5 restaurants located inside Burj Al Arab, with the help and full assistance of sommeliers in connection with each of the plates that my wife and I choosed (for example wine with : lobster, foie gras, thaï noodles, meat, giant shrimps, etc.). The Best tables were always booked for us and we highly enjoyed this unique experience. Be aware that at the end of your evening, you may feel quite filled up with drinks and food, but it is so good that hardly you will leave anything in your plates !
At all times, the service was personalized at the highest possible level you may find in this world, it was just perfect from the beginning til the end of our stay. Our favorite restaurant was definitively Al Mahara, with a table located just next to the beautiful acquarium and opposite the main entrance, just amazing ! A special thank you to Mr Florian Lay, new staff in the restaurant Al Mahara, who gave us such a good and great service, that we understood how much staff like him appreciate what they are doing and show their happiness in their daily work duties by the quality of the services they are providing to their guests. I will soon write an additonal review for each of the 5 restaurants that we visited, including photos.
On the next day, we woke up early to enjoy the indoor pool and the jacuzzi of the spa located on the 18th floor. It was a good decision, as we were absolutely the 2 only guests during all the time we spent there. 
Then we had beakfast in Bab Al Yam, with a table located outside, just next to the pool on ground floor, just once more amazing service and food there.
To finalise our memorable stay, we planned a meeting with the General Manager, whom, unfortunately, could not be present, but we then had the chance to meet again and to discuss in Skyview Bar with the Hotel Manager, the highly professional and excellent Mr Ammar Hilal. A complimentary transfer with a white Rolls Royce was organised for us, in order to reach our next destination, Al Qasr Hotel, which in fact we never really saw as we got an upgrade upon arrival in Al Qasr Reception, to Dar Al Masyaf Villa No 3 !!!

So, to resume my Burj Al Arab ULTIMATE experience :

Positive points :
--------------------

1) Highest quality of personalized services ever seen.
2) Exceptional staff attitude, smilling, friendly, listening, fast, efficient, helpful, sincere.
3) Top quality of food presented in all restaurants.
4) Fresh flowers (roses) in the Panoramic Suite in huge quantity.
5) SPA is absolutely amazing and specially view from the indoor pool of 18th floor.
6) Bathroom complimentary Hermes products.
7) Food and drinks with alcool offered inside the Suite.
8) Almost all my requests were granted and successfully managed !
9) Management vision of the Hotel and how guests should be taken care of is just fantastic.
10) Full time Butler service at each floor of the Hotel, check in, check out, special requests, all was done perfectly.

Points which could be improved :
-----------------------------------------

1) Jacuzzi was too hot.
2) Button to start jacuzzi should be installed next to it and not on the wall, as guest have everytime to stand up, to walk to the button to push it and to come back inside jacuzzi, first time I saw this...
3) Sugar in Bab Al Yam restaurant should not be put into small transparent plastic bags, as when you open them, if seated outside, wind will blow those papers away, as far as there are no garbages on the tables. Better to come back to old system with sugar in small cups.
4) We did not find cu-typs (to clean ears) inside our Suite...

Well, that was the most incredible and ultimate luxury birthday experience I ever had. 

Burj Al Arab, don't just keep on dreaming of it, be part of it and live it at least once in your life ! You will not regret it, this I garantee, only your wallet may complain somehow ;-)

Please look at the photos I will soon add to my review and to my video channel on www.youtube.com, subject being ""otterboris"", or you can also insert the same subject in www.google.com to see some of the video HD that I just started to post from today.

Burj Al Arab, we will come back !

P.S. Prepare cash for tips for those excellent staffs, most of them working for you during your stay really deserve one !","5","2012-04"
"Awesome","The most luxurious hotel in the world. Period. An iconic establishment. We celebrate our wedding anniversary every year in the hotel. Spa, high tea, dinner. They always offer a complimentary cake at the end of the meal. ( for us this has become a tradition) . You either should have a room reservation or a restaurant/ spa reservation to get into the property. It is definitely not as expensive as people expect it to be! ( the rooms are perhaps expensive, but this is an all suite hotel, but restaurants are not! There are a lot of places in Dubai that are more outrageously priced!","5",
"OMG","OMG, best experiance i have ever done in my life, luxury and more luxury just amazing! its dear,but well worth it!!!!","5","2012-02"
"A nice break","Wonderful trip and stay at the Burj.  From the collection by white Phantom to the staff awaiting my arrival and keen to attend to everything, the experience was very nice.

They provided me with a lovely cake in my suite as it had been my birthday several days before I arrived.","5","2011-08"
"Just perfect!","I booked 2 suite for my parents and my husband and I. and we actually get a two bed suite. It is very spacious, 2 living rooms and 2 bedrooms over 2 floors. all bath accessories are hermes. It has breath taking view from the big windows in every room. service is of course brilliant. 
There are several restaurants inc alrab, european, chinese and indian food.

we wanted to extend our stay, but unfortunately the hotel is fully booked.","5","2012-01"
"Very good hospitality","The staff is amazing, the rooms are not our taste of interior, but the quality is good. The service is great and everything will be arranged what you ask for. And we asked for different things and all was arranged. Take the RR for a drive, have drinks at the skyview bar and enjoy everything else this icon has to offer. 

Downside in my opinion is that they let to many tourist buses in. Our check in at hotel was not a good experience, to many tourist in the way.","5","2011-05"
"The 7 star rating is all in the service","I have read it said by celebrities that once you fly by private jet, you are ruined for commercial travel for ever after.  Similarly, my biggest problem with the Burj Al Arab is that it has spoilt me in terms of what I have come to expect from service. There is, quite simply, nothing and no place I have ever been that compares with it in this area. 

I said to my husband that staying at the Burj al Arab gave me some inkling of what it must be like to be a Rock Star (minus the talent and substance abuse issues that is) -  with an entourage that never say no and make everything happen for you at the snap of your fingers. Not sure this is a good thing mind, but when you are on holiday, why not right?  Time to enjoy.

There are many examples of it, but here are two:  On the first morning we arrived the staff asked me what I would like to drink to accompany the (excellent) breakfast buffet. I said something to the effect of, ""Well, I appreciate this is a long shot, but is there any chance you do vegetable juice?""  I had been juicing back in London and was quite prepared to forgo this for our two week holiday. Well, no need. The waiter took my preferred list of ingredients and a few minutes later returned with two freshly made glasses of juice.  The next morning one was produced without my asking, and every day for the rest of our holiday.  The juice got better each time, as the person making it evidently experimented with ingredients.

One morning I filled in one of those little customer review forms they sometimes include with the check. I said that breakfast was lovely, but it would be a real treat if they had a pork bacon station as some of the other Jumeria hotels in Dubai do. I know, I know, but I do love bacon, and so do my children.

The next morning I sat down to breakfast, and as if by magic, a plate with bacon (beautifully cooked) was placed in front of me. The manager explained that by Dubai law they are not permitted to have bacon with the buffet (I think it's a matter of proximity to the other food which the larger hotels can manage but not a smaller one), but that they were very happy to make it for me on request.  The next morning a plate was produced without my asking. 

Oh, and here's another one that really impressed me: On the occasions that our butler (see below for more on butlers) booked restaurants for us, I was always greeted by the waiter with a ""Good afternoon/good evening Mrs X, I believe you have a gluten free diet, please let me point out which dishes are appropriate on our menu."" That was a great touch I thought.

Which leads me to an important point about the service and what I think makes it so unique;  The staff at this hotel, from the butlers, to the waiting staff, and even the blessed people who cleaned up the wreck our room was in the mornings - all of them seemed to pride themselves on being a step ahead of you and knowing what you wanted or needed even before you did.

The way the Burj works is that each floor has a butler, which is really just an antiquated term for a go-to person that organises things for you, books yours dinners, spa services, etc.  They even take newly purchased toys and find a screwdriver and insert the batteries for you. These lovely people learn your names and the names of your children and you are warmly greeted each time you pass through, any heavy-looking bags are taken off of you, and you are escorted to your room. And forget needing a key as they always open the door for you anyway.  

The decorating in the suites (they are all duplex btw), is famously colourful, and not to everyone's taste. It took me a few days to get used to it, and it can be quite jarring. A bit Liberace chic, and the decorator evidently felt it necessary to use his/her vivid colour palate liberally with a good splash of gold when in doubt. So if you like a very clean calm white and beige-type feel in your bedroom to help you relax and sleep at night, this is not the hotel for you. The mirror on the ceiling above the bed was also interesting, which warranted a creative explanation by us for our 4-year-old daughter as to its function.  The views however are awesome, despite the purple brocade curtains that framed it.

Children under 6 eat free, but not via room service. We'd take our children to the pool restaurant (Bar Al Yam) in the evenings  and enjoy a glass of wine while they had their dinner. And forget microwaved fish fingers, pizza and chips - think beautifully cooked little steaks, dover sole, pasta's, etc. Our kids genuinely loved the food.

They also have an excellent baby-sitting service. The woman arrived at our hotel in the evening with two phones - one for us and one for her, so a direct link should we need to speak to her or vice versa.  We used the opportunity to visit their famous Sky Bar on a few occasions (breathtaking views over Dubai at night), and also their excellent fish restaurant.

In terms of kid friendliness, the staff are all lovely, friendly, and good humoured and not at all averse to the massive mess they make wherever they go, as one might expect from a hotel of this calibre. There is a kids pool next to the family pool. There aren't fountains and see-saws and sprayee-type things as you get at the Al Qasr's Sinbad kids club (although you do have access to that). It's a little paddling pool and provided you take some plastic toys, it's fine for the toddlers. My 2-year-old son liked playing in it, and my 4-year-old daughter enjoyed floating around in her life jacket in the family pool.

There is a kids club too, but it's a single smallish, windowless room on the 18th floor with toys in. The TV, albeit on a kids channel, was constantly on which I found annoying, especially given the lovely selection of toys rendering it quite unnecessary. Fine for about an hour or so if you want to get the kids out of the sun, but not more than that. 

For the ladies and men who like their smellies, the bathroom cosmetics for your use are, wait for it, Hermes. Which you can enjoy while you luxuriate in the large (think Magnum PI) jacuzzi bath. And every evening your get a little gift on your bed at turn down. The kids got so much chocolate they may well require early root canal treatment, and my husband I got an array of lovely goodies such as perfume (more Hermes, oh yes!), chocolates, mobile phone cleaning gadgets (?), and cosmetics. Like little loot bags at the end of a really good kids party.

Would we go back? I loved it for the experience - it's so opulent, the service is superb, and well, there is Hermes in the bathroom. Is it for children? Well, you may need to get a buggy to the bigger kids club or across to the Executive pool at the Jeremiah Beach Hotel on occasion. And there's always Wild Wadi to visit. But given that it helps to have a daily excursion, however small, with small children anyway, it seems like a minor detail. Think of it as a family hotel for people who don't like family hotels.

Biggest plus: Superb 'nothing is too much trouble' service
Biggest minus: Terribly expensive","5","2012-03"
"The best!","We paid for a spa package which included day use of the facilities, massage, spa, beach, and dinner.  It was well worth it!  Look into this, much better than the tea.  We arrived and were toured through the spa, given lockers and then went down to lobby. A golf cart awaited us to take us to their beach, a short walk away.  Upon arrival at the beach, we were greeted by name and walked to our nice chairs and umbrella. We were given a bucket of cold bottled waters, facial mist spray, and cold ice facial towels.  The man set us up with our chairs and we enojed some pampered beach time. After a couple of hours at the beach we returned to the hotel spa.  We swam in the infinity pool on the 18th floor with beautiful views of the sea, used the whirlpools and relaxed. FYI, there is a lifeguard on duty, Of course, the whole spa is female only, as men have their own spa.  The service in the spa was outstanding, as was the facility.  We also used the steam, sauna and plunge pool.  After we went in the relaxation room and my daughter and I each were taken to very large private massage suites. There were floor to ceiling windows with great views again of the sea and Atlantis. The masssage was very good.  After we remained in the lounge having tea. Then showered and one of th emany attendants dried our bathing suits in the spin dryers, we were given items and got ready for dinner.  We had dinner at Jensui, an Asian buffet restaurant. Waiting for us at the table was a rose for my daughter, When requesting the package I had to email to ask if they would allow(min age was 16) my daughter and told them she was turning 13 while in Dubai and this package was her present. Dinner and service was again excellent. At the end, they even brought out a small chocolate birthday cake for her!!! then we were given 2 boxes of small decorated chocolates. A great ending to a wonderful day.  Was about 1900 AED, and well worth it!","5",
"Best hotel experience - EVER!","I don't know how anyone can give this hotel anything but 5 stars! I stayed in a honeymoon suite. Luxurious does not begin to describe the amenities. The staff was superb, the facilities modern and elegant, the view was gorgeous, the property immaculate, the beach pristine, the restaurants pleasant. I could go on for days. I have stayed in places all over the world. It will be hard to ever stay anywhere else.","5","2011-09"
"Totally Amazing!!!!","This hotel is just amazing!!! it is sooo gorgeous and the service was impeccible!! The staff could not do enough for us!! We arrived early in the morning and were able to check-in immediately!! Whenever I asked for something it was done within a short period of time.
The concierge arranged several excursions for us.  Though all were quite expensive..each was a fabulous experience.
We also partipated in the hotel's ""Culinary Flight"".  You enjoy 5 courses each in a different restaurant located throught out the hotel.
My husband and I were throughly thrilled and it was a great end to a wonderful 3 week vacation.","5","2012-03"
"Only one regret.......","This hotel is simply incredible. Our only regret is knowing that quite probably no other hotel we ever stay in will match the outrageous opulence and stellar service levels of the Burj.

We stopped for a three night stay on the way back from our honeymoon in September and from the moment you get into the Rolls royce at the airport to the time you arrive at departures, you are suddenly escalated to being the most important people in the world. Nothing is too much trouble.

Some advice; there are better, and much cheaper, restaurants elsewhere in Dubai. Only dine in if you want the experience of the world class surroundings on offer - we recommend the underwater al Mahara. 

Do not go for the dinner inclusive options.. You will sit down and have the main a la cart menu taken off you to be replaced by a streamlined far less impressive, set menu option.

Go to jun sui for breakfast, and give yourself at least an hour, you'll need it to try all of the culinary delights on offer.

Overall, this place is simply the best hotel you could possibly imagine. If you want to escape and be made to feel like royalty, then ignore the bank balance and book.","5","2011-09"
"Very dissappointed with no responce back form complaints card","I was takin here by my husband for my 40 th birthday on the 14th feburday it was also our  14th weddin annivarsery.I was not very impressed with our room as it had a lot of faulty things wrong. 1 Bath stopper was brokin asked it to be fixed twice. 2 No tv sound on tv till day we were leavin.3 No internet access or printer would not work. 4 our son lifted a glass and it shattered very nasty cut on his finger. 5 Givin a bill for 18000dhs on leavin when the bill had been paided when we arrived .6 Childs meal over priced. 7 Vert dissopinted that no one has contact us after we fill out comments card","4","2012-02"
"Extreme luxury does not equal best service","The arquitecture is amazing, the rooms are with no doubt some of the most luxury and beautiful that exist.
Unfortunately the service is not.
I am not staying that the service is bad, but in my opinion a hotel that gives it self 6 stars should also have the best service.
I' ve been in hotels where the service is a lot better.
Tip: take a panoramic suite it is just amazing.","4","2011-08"
"Burj in Dubai","Luxury PLUS, it is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed. Immaculately kept, the staff very friendly and the service was wonderful, personally I cannot fault this hotel. The spa and swimming floor is to die for, viewes from the room on the 11th floor magnificent. The bathrooms have full size Hermes products and were always replenished. Bed was heaven all size pillows for your liking. In the evening blinds automatically came down for sleeping.  Afternoon tea bought to the room every day. Butler service was good. Shops in the hotel very beautiful but expensive, souks close by and were wonderful, weel worth a stay. It was a business trip for one week, I was a nanny so everything was paid for me. I wish I could go back.","5","2011-04"
"Take  pictures of it inside&out and stay somewhere else",". I paid 8000dirhams (approx $2,300) per night for 'Panoramic Suite' ,and sorry to say - the place is mediocre at best.

The service is poor, The restaurants (and I tried all of them) are of avarage  quality at ridiculous prices. 

 There are much better hotels in Dubai .

And its much worse for famillies with small kids who r not being accepted in many of its reataurants.","2","2011-07"
"Under Expectation","based on 7 stars hotel.. it is still stay under expectation especially with their resturuants.. Bad Experience.. Very poor meals.. delay with services..

They just have a small pool outside the breakfast area..","3",

"The Best Hotel Ever","We stayed at this Hotel for ten days in December 2004 in a Jnr Suite, it was over two floors and fantastic.

We had the best Taxi ever pick us up at the Airport from the Hotel a Rolls Royce Phantom (ok it did cost £200 both ways) but worth every penny as two guy's had a plack up with our names on at immigration and they opened a line up just for us, like being a football star!!

When we got to the Hotel they took us up straight to our room ( no front desk check in) and within 30min a butler had unpacke both of our cases.

Each morning the doorbell would ring at 08:00am and a pot of tea was deliverd with a copy of the Mail ( by Order)

One day I went swimming in the indoor pool and put my trunks down to have a shower and when I got out they had gone, upon asking the attendant said that they had been sent to be cleaned and would be back in my room in 20 min.

The service, staff and food was fantastic 11/10

I managed to get an offer from Amex to stay in this Hotel with 50% off the normal price and it was the best deal I have ever paid for must be like going to Heaven.","5","2011-12"
"7 stars - but you pay for it.","We have been on vacation many times to Dubai but decided to spend 2 nights in the iconic Burj.
It is everything we thought it would be and more. Our suite on the 19th floor (the higher the better) was out of this world. Lavishly decorated and every need catered for. Grand stairs lead to a large bedroom with magnificent views. Your designated butler is there to help your stay a truly wonderful experience.
Great swimming pool, attentive staff working hard to make our visit a memorable one.
We ate in the 2 signature Restaurants, very expensive but very exclusive. You could eat out at the many restaurants nearby - but then why stay in the burj.
The Burj exceeded our expectations but also exceeded our budget.","4","2012-03"
"A very special treat","Whilst staying in a club executive room at the Jumeirah Beach we received a very generous invitation to transfer to the Burj al Arab. It was absolutely fantastic! The suite was beautiful, lunch and breakfast were delicious, staff exceptional and friendly, not at all snooty. On the face of it the prices are expensive but when you experience it you realise that actually it is good value. I was so impressed I am thinking of returning soon with a friend. The ladies only pool on the 18th floor deserves a special mention, as does the exceptionally comfortable bed!","5","2012-03"
"The only seven star hotel in the world.","If you have the money, this is your place. Two story room over looking the coast. Marble, chandeliers and luxury saturate your being. Universal remote controls your door (with video camera to see who is outside) the TV's (the one in the bedroom raises out of the dresser) and the lights. An RFID chip in your card wallet tracks your movement in the hotel so you are greeted personally at the eateries, spa, and bar. The aquarium and views are breathtaking. The service is superb (You have an individual service desk on your floor), and the food was incredible. I could go on and on but really all I have to say is this hotel lives up to its reputation and so much more. If you get the chance you won't regret it.","5","2011-04"
"Extortionate - and Not worth it","The Burj Al Arab - allow people to visit their hotel as long as they sign up and commit to spending a minimum of over £140.00 - A complete rip off and not worh it at all.  I popped out to look at the garden and pool area and it wasn't anywhere near as nice as its neighbours in the Jumeriah Group.  The weeds were growing up through all the cracks and the sunbeds were mainly placed on top of the concrete paths.  I've seen a lot better - I'm sure they must get their seven star rating from inside because it definately isn't from the outside.","5",
"Were we Dreaming","After the weather at home last Xmas we decided to do Xmas at the Burj. As we stepped into the hotel to such beautiful decorations we knew our fate.....All we can say again is thank you and was so nice to meet the people behind the scenes who made it special for us , so nice also to meet them in person. Nimal in reservations who has the patience of a saint continually answering my questions and Nehza in housekeeping who made our suite feel like home with such pretty Xmas things. Our Xmas diner in Bab al Yam was fab as was the staff ad nw chef who all looked after us again  the two Mohamed's again in Al Iwan. We always feel very much at home here from the moment the door is opened by the very attentive door staff to saying hello to the staff we have et over the years and still privileged to stay there. See you all soon again.","5","2011-12"
"Great Value for Money","Which when you consider the cost is quite remarkable.  But, we booked the honeymoon package (to celebrate our anniversary) and couldn't have been happier with the whole experience.  

The package included accommodation, a return car trip, flowers on arrival, champagne, a spa trip for two, dinner and breakfast - and from the moment we arrived we were made to feel special.  The car that was sent to collect us was lovely, the room had a spectacular view, the butler service was second-to-none and the room was truly spectacular (although the decoration was not really to my taste as I tend to prefer a little less gold!)  The duplex room was indeed spacious and had a wide-range of facilities.  While the Hermes toiletries in the bathroom were incredibly generous!  

The spa experience that was included in the package was also fantastic and the ladies swimming pool on the 18th floor had a great view over the palm.

Down-sides of the hotel? The evening meal in the restaurant at the top of the hotel was disappointing - the decoration was very tired, the meal was very ordinary and it was really not as special as everything else we experienced.  The outdoor swimming pool is very ordinary and the number of day-trippers in the reception area makes the hotel feel a little less exclusive.  

But, we would definitely recommend this hotel for the 'special occasion'.","4","2012-01"
"Breathtaking!","We could only afford one night here, and I was worried that as we weren't hugely rich that the staff would be a bit snooty with us.  But on the contrary, they seemed delighted that we were so happy to be there!  
 
Check in - you never really feel like you are checking in - an elegant lady greets you at the door with refreshing cold face towels and stuffed dates, and shows you the fountains and the foyer (and rescued our daughter from japanese photographers, bizarre!), and takes you in the lift to the right floor to meet your butler!  We'd asked for a high floor facing the madinat and were delighted to be given just that.  
 
Room - well that's an understatement, it's bigger than a normal apartment!  Downstairs is a lounge, office area, dining table, bar area and d/s loo.  Up the sweeping staircase with chandelier, you have a dressing area, huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub and walk in shower, and the bedroom which also has a lounge area.  Mirrors on the ceiling ;-)  Decor was stunning, I was expecting glitzy red and gold but ours was quite tasteful really in purples and blues.  Then started the 'freebies' (well, I suppose they're included in the price) - full size Hermes toiletries for him and her, beach bag, gift packs for the kids, slippers, stuffed date selection, biscuit selection, and bottle of red wine.  Our butler was happy to point out all the stuff we could take home, it was so lovely!!  Kids were 9 and 10 so in the evening they converted the sofa bed for one, and brought a single bed in for the other.  Place was so huge you didn't even really notice! 

In the evening there were more pressies - a tray of little chocolates, G&Ts for us and sparkling apple juice in champagne glasses for the kids.  So my advice would be resist the minibar (at 40AED for a coke!) and wait for the freebies!  
 
Pool - not the largest of course, as it's on the man made island around the base of the building.  But perfectly adequate.  One main pool, with swim up bar, and one v shallow one for tots.  Attentive lifeguards.  And the treats kept coming - 1st a coolbox delivered to our sunbeds containing Evian facial spray, cold scented flannels and bottles of mineral water.  Then an hour later, saucers of jelly beans.  Another hour later, little boxes of warm popcorn!  The staff were fab, you weren't allowed to do anything for yourself eg move a sunbed or do the parasol, they wanted to look after you.  The views are lovely from round the pool - of the building itself, and both shorelines, and out to sea.  It's like being on a stunning cruiseliner.  

For a change of scenery, check out the indoor pools on Floor 18.  There's a mixed one, and a ladies only one.  The ladies one has a stunning view, and gets the sunset, but both are worth checking out if poss! 

View of atrium - this is stunning - obviously you can gaze up into the atrium from the ground floor lobby, but also make time to take the lift to fl 18 and look down, it's quite something.

Restaurants - well I'll be honest, we couldn't afford them, so we ate back on the shore at the Madinat Jumeirah.  Breakfast was included though, at Bab Al Yams, and it was fab - just a perfect little selection of everything you could wish for eg I made cream cheese and smoked salmon bagels from the buffet.  The other restaurants looked amazing too.  We did treat ourselves to cocktails up in the skyview bar, which has amazing views over the sea and the coastline to either side.  Very expensive but v special.  Book ahead if you have a particular timeslot in mind.

Staff - superlative.  They were so friendly, and good at their jobs, and pleased to be looking after you.  They all seemed to know your name, and could even tell you where the other members of your family were if you got separated!  Our favourite butler was Richard, who insisted on organising our onward transport in a complementary hotel mercedes - we'd asked for a buggy, but he said 'no guest of mine is leaving the Burj in a buggy'!!

I would desperately love to return, it's a top 10 life experience for sure.  Hope some of this is helpful.","5","2012-02"
"Very classy hotel!","Classy interiors.......gold and shimmer everywhere! Very beautiful architecture! Rooms were also very well kept. Great staff","4","2012-02"
"Couldn't be better","Although you pay extra for a Rolls Royce pick-up from the airport, it's worth it (just at around £200) as you are greeted from the plane and whisked through customs without the need to queue or talk to anyone. You're not even allowed to touch your cases as someone does that for you then you are taken straight to the Rolls and presented with a bottle of Evian and a CD menu, a but old-fashioned but a nice touch.

When you arrive at the hotel you have 5 or 6 people to greet you and provide you with towels and dates. You are escorted to your floor and introduced to your Butler. There are 3 Butlers per floor working 8 hours each and they can't do enough for you. Do tip the people who bring your cases up, 10 Dhs is probably sufficient. I have read reviews that you shouldn't tip the Butler on day one as he will keep coming back for more. It's tricky though as you may have more dealings with one than another and may want to tip someone who is not there when you check out. 100 Dhs is fine for a tip unless he really goes above and beyond. 

The rooms are enormous. Downstairs you have a cloakroom with gold taps (but formica worktops) a study area, coffee machine with capsules, fresh fruit and a bottle of non-alcoholic bubbles. Huge TV, everything is remote, even the vast curtains and the views are incredible. Large sofas and a dining table. Then it's up the sweeping staircase to the bedroom suite. The bedroom is huge with the finest fabrics and furnishings, a TV that comes out of the sideboard, lounge area, mirrored-ceiling above the bed etc. The bathroom is vast and has everything you need, including full-sized Hermes toiletries, although only one per stay and not replaced every day. Separate Jacuzzi and huge bath. Lovely.

The dry cleaning service is very good too.

The breakfast is very good, not the best in the world but very good. The restaurants are overpriced and not worth it, but the Skyview bar is worth a visit for the views and you can have any cocktail imaginable. Expect to pay £20 for a drink.

The staff are fantastic, they cannot do too much for you. Even when I tried to move the parasol, someone came running out to do it! 

This is an incredible experience and well worth it, even if only once. £1200 a night in the summer and around double in peak season isn't cheap, but for a honeymoon or 40th etc, it really is worth the hype.","5","2011-08"
"7 Stars!","One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at... worth staying here is money isn't an issue, if so stay elsewhere. Had a panoramic suite on a lower floor, very clean and spacious room with multiple views. All amenities in the room were top notch as expected. Customer service was great with people on hand to serve with the push of a button.

Included in package was airport transfer and breakfast. Both worked out well. Very elegant property with a sense of exclusivity. Only hotel guests can enter the property.

If you have money to spend, stay here!","5","2012-02"
"Exciting hotel","We have travelled to Dubai extensively, this time we decided to give the Burj a try, my husband has stayed before and has asked for years to book again. I felt our children were too young before, villas with pools work well with very young babies and children. 

It has to be said that most people find this hotel amazing. It is an iconic hotel and of course it is very impressive. The hotel as far as I can see have definitely stepped up the security which I was very pleased to see and the wonderful welcome - the staff traditionally and rather beautifully dressed impressed my daughters no end (A real princess Mummy my three year old gasped!) The suites are to die for, and although very indulgently and colourfully decorated for most tastes you could not help but enjoy the grandness of it all. The hotel does really reflect the Arabian culture and love for all things gold and shiny, and it is beautiful in its own unique way. The suite was immaculate, even by my standards and the view was just stunning (20th floor) The pool room, kitchen, lounges and duplex style bedrooms complete with various bathrooms was a wonderful setting with views to the sea as well as land. It was enjoyable to sit and simply look at the view (which was ever changing)  for an hour or two. 

The butler and the service of all of the team was razor sharp. Every single thing aspect of the hotel has been meticulously considered, such is the attention to detail you find yourself enjoying the most simple past times such as ordering drinks, snacks. The dinner was exquisite, and the breakfast divine.

The bedrooms were extremely comfortable and peaceful. Although for me the mirror above the four poster bed was abit much!!! I may need to request a room without that in future, but some may like it!! 

The pool was fabulous, quite small as you would expect as they have limited space ~ but very good, lots of loungers to choose from on manicured grass and around the pool. The little trees and the sound of the sea gives the pool area a very welcome holiday feeling with the added sophistication of little Burj pool boxes containing Evian spray, chilled scented towels, cold water and snacks. Everything was absolutely perfect ~ the service immediate and attentive. My children enjoyed the pool, the childrens robes and slippers and the little bag of Disney cosmetics. Well done to the Burj for getting this right for families.

The beach area was very good with the view of the hotel, lot of lounger, fantastic beach staff (One in particular pleased me no end by providing lunch for my children at a moment's notice and when the kitchen was in fact closed - thank you for that) The beach toys given also meant we had a blissful morning on the beach with happy children.

There is little I can say beyond the fact I was not really excited about this part of our trip, but  in fact I very much enjoyed this hotel, much more than I thought I would and can well believe it is one if not the best hotel in the world, I dont think there is anything more they could do to win the title - they have thought of everything.","5","2012-02"
"Superb","I have been traveling to the Burj Al Arab for a few years now with my husband and three small children.  I must have been almost 10 times now.We come from South Africa and the currency is not strong so it is expensive but it is so worth it. Whenever I travel abroad I stop both ways in Dubai as I fly Emirates. In fact that hotel has been so good to us that I would not go anywhere else. This is by far THE VERY BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD.  And it feels like home to me when I am there. The staff are soooo well trained and they are so excellent in every area of there work that it is beyond words to describe. Because of their excellence I will continue to go back for ever.","5","2011-11"
"A Wonder.!!!!!!!","Amazing architecture, a master piece worth calling a 7 star hotel.
The service is also one of the finest in the world.","5","2011-12"
"Summer stays at the Burj al Arab","Have stayed three times for long weekends in the Burj.  I loved every minute of it.  During the summer months more affordable rates can be booked...the lowest of the year.  I thought I wouldn't like the idea of a butler but found that I enjoyed the service too much.  Drinks and canapes served every afternoon.  Twice catered caviar and champagne get togethers that were both informative, informal, friendly and carefully tended.  For a special treat, everyone should spend a weekend in the Burj.","5","2011-07"
"Brilliant!!","This was a really glam location obviously very famous we were on our honeymoon and they brought me a rose and a card and I thought that was very nice.

The food was very expensive but very nice.  I did however have a small stone in my chicken I wondered could it of been bone but it was round.  I can't fault the way it was handled though the staff couldn't of done enough.

We would definitely go back after dinner we moved to the very funky bar and this was brilliant for drinks.

A must see place with fab views of Dubai.","5","2011-08"
"Out of this world...","My wife and I stayed at the Burj Al Arab to celebrate my 40th Birthday, and boy what a Birthday, who would have thought turning 40 could be this painless...

Self-proclamation often leads to disappointment; this self-proclaimed 7 star hotel certainly does NOT! 

Since the introduction of the star rating system by the AA in 1912, the range of 1-5 stars has offered travellers from all walks of life the ability to choose hotels of suitable comfort, for both their means and requirements. The 1-5 star rating has been proved to sufficiently categorise hotels of all size, types and comfort levels. Well, in my opinion the Burj Al Arab has rewritten the rule book, and justifies its self-proclaimed 7 star rating, and strapline of ""The World’s Most Luxurious Hotel""

Irrespective of social standing and means you are treated with respect and grace, as is often lacking in hotels of this calibre. Everyone is attentive, and extremely helpful, the food is sublime, even a lowly croc monsieur from room service is elevated to Michelin star standards.

The indoor pool offers some of the most intoxicating views of Dubai, and the view of the Arabian Gulf from our room was simply stunning. Rarely am I at a loss for words, but I find myself desperately lacking in adjectives to be able to convey the experience this hotel offers.

I could wax lyrical about how amazing every component is, but sufficed to say, every detail is perfect, from the most opulent of décor, amazing architecture through to the most lavish of toiletries. 

If you have to opportunity to go, I strongly recommend the packing service; your clothes have never been treated with such care…

This isn’t a hotel, it’s an experience and one that everyone should have at least once in their life.","5","2012-01"
"7-stars excellency","From arrival at the airport, Rolls Royce transfer to the hotel,driver passing on details re eta,name etc .At arrival all details arranged, very spacious panorama suite, double floor,350m2
with the butler. Spent here 8 lovely days meeting business aquaintances, indeed i impressed
them with the hotel as was the intention,butler collecting them from the main reception area and escorting them to the suite etc,It helps when doing busines with the arab people.
Dining on the top floor looking to the sea etc, top-class menues and very good wines like
the montracet, ok not cheap but who cares.The arab restaurant in the main-lobby is of worldclass while the visit by ""submarine"""" to the other restaurant is really funny.
The brakfast is quite extensive and I enjoyed the camelmilk.
Going from the hotel over the """"dam"""" to the beach and beachrestaurant, either walking or
by ""buggy"""" having lunch there is a real treaty.
If you can visit this hotel it will be worthwhile and a milestone to remember.","5","2011-10"
"very expensive, but every cent worth it!","If you have some spare moneys and would like to try luxury at the most, then the Burj al Arab is the place to be. We (my wife, daughter and I) not only enjoyed the room (they only have suites of two floors each) but also the impeccable view you have from the suite to the town and sea. I have been travelling all over the world, but the service you get at the Burj al Arab is unbeatable. We only stayed two nights (could not afford more), but could not see one flow to mention.","5","2012-02"
"The most luxurious hotel in the world","The hotel couldnt be access if you do not have any booking for room or meals - all tourists were not able to step beyond the guard house so lots of them taking picture of the hotel from afar. 

The luxury and the standard is so luxurious that is beyond imagination.  The famous fountain welcomes the guests with escalator taking you to the upper foyer, and every corner is so delicatedly decorated. 

Booked 1 month in advance, we had a 4 course lunch at it's 27th floor restaurant. Sitting by the window, he view is magnificent: to the left is the Palm and the Atlantis hotel, to the right is the World.  In the middle is the gulf of Arab.  The food was delicious, especially the goose liver that melts in your mouth. 

We have decided to revisit next year to have lunch in the underwater restaurant.","5",
"Stunning","We were fortunate enough to stay here and have a wonderful experience. It is over the top in every way, nothing discreet or minimalist about it! We were picked up in a Rolls Royce and chauffeured to the hotel. The staff are exceptional. Every whim and request are catered to immediately. The rooms are all double storey, gorgeous mosaic bathrooms, amazing view. The bed is large although the mirror on the ceiling is a bit disconcerting. The pool area is small but the infinity pool and the view over the Gulf make up for size. Hermes amenities in the bathroom: shampoo, lotion, and full size cologne and perfume. An exceptional experience in luxury.","5",
"SIMPLY STUNNING","One must thing to do in Dubai is visit "" Burj Al Arab ""..Pictures wont do justice this marvel & I may fall short words to describe this man made wonder.

The interiors are extremely modern & give a glamorous look,staff extremely friendly & hospitable...Fountains inside the premises is breathtaking & one can keep watching it for the entire day.

The bridge connecting the hotel is lined up on both the sides with UAE flag & it looks awesome.The entrance to the hotel is Ala Grand, chandeliers are beautiful.","5",
"Oh my!!","Amazing hotel, the service is second to none an you feel like royalty from the moment you arrive! Loved it","5","2012-01"
"A great building","I love the Burj Al Arab as a piece of sculpture with a big presence on the Dubai skyline. Inside it is over the top and not to my taste but hey, those who can afford to stay there are likely to be the ones whose taste matches the interior!! The fish restaurant is prety good.","4",
"An Arabian Delight","The flagship of Dubai. Architectural dynamite. Interior design breathtaking. For sure not everyone's idea of beauty but it is to behold. The finest of everything. An all suite paradise. Your own butler. Every whim catered for. Stunning rooms wonderful spa and glorious dining choices. Room products are the finest. You get what you pay for and this should be experienced once in a lifetime. 3 days is enough but I could be persuaded!","5","2011-05"

"More than excellent, out of this world!","We enjoyed 4 nights in this very special resort. You don´t need to anywhere else in Dubai whilst staying in this hotel!

The best Irish coffee in the downstairs bar!","5","2012-01"
"7 stars - really?","Too much of a tourist attraction/theme park to earn its 7 stars - the lobby was seething.  Service at the Skyview Bar wasn't as good as could have been expected.  Greeting at the lobby wasn't great and we weren't directed very well.","4",
"Quite an experience!!!","Burj el Arab  is the landmark of the city of Dubai , and the views of the ocean, the beaches and the city from the Panoramic suites over the ocean are amazing. We arrived from Auckland for a 96 hs stop over in Dubai before going back home.  Although it was not planned it was great to decide to stay at least for three days and nights. We were kindly welcomed by an argentinian hostess (apparently the hotel hires people from all over the world) and presented to our butler on the fitfth floor and taken to our Panoramic suite. They were really kind as they gave us a very early check in. Some time after we entered our suite, our 8 year old asked... when are we going to the room? and we had to say we were already in this incredible huge  two floor room, all gold, blue and red to suddenly discover the overpresence of gold was not as disgusting to the eye as we thought it would be. The gold and the rest of the striking colours somehow blend prefectly with what you see through the windows, with the culture, it s Dubai after all...  just one of the places where golden colours and some other strange decorations do match with the entire delirium of this particular city. It was the largest suite we ever been to and could not stop looking around at all the details, top brand amenities, huge window panes and lovely views!  The service is said to be 7 stars, and as regards the staff, the people working there, and how much they care  as if they were your personal assistants I can say it could easily be in fact, a 7 star service. A very professional concierge -butler is always there in less than half a minute for whatever you might need, car rental, maps, anything! So I would give 7 stars to them, always informed and warm, calling you by your name and paying attention to every detail. Another 7 stars for the outstanding room service and restaurants!  Dining in your room with views of the ocean and Dubai is something worth doing! A whole variety of dishes from every part of the world! Do you want an indian dish? An original chicken curry, with naan bread and all the right dressings and original components of the dish will be in your own dining room in less than half an hour. Also, the restaurants are great, the maitres, the waiters and the food. Any of the breakfast restaurants is out of this world, the Asian Breakfast has an extraordinary variety and your are able to try the most delicious dishes from other cultures as well as from yours... dim sums, exotic fruits, different pastries, eggs whatever style you can imagine.. a whole professional crew is there to make your breakfast experience quite an amazing one. Also, the lovely red and gold decorated restaurant downstairs in the lobby was also excellent for breakfast, our son was delighted to have the chance to share the cooking of his breakfast  with one of the executive chefs , everybody friendly, everybody there for you.. you really feel the delights of being pampered by one of the best trained hotel and restaurant teams in the world.
The architecture is another very impressing thing, the ship shape building is incredible, from its windows you can see the Jumeriah wave building as well, the Burj al Califa tower which is the tallest in the world and one of the most  beautiful too,  you can even spot the slanted tube over the Jumierah mall that serves as an indoors artificial crazy ski park inside the mall, and from other side ,  the huge entrance of the exotic, arab-american style Atlantis Resort can also be seen. 
Nothing is much in this city and its hotels.. more is always more! Tallest towers, golden frames, sparkling floors, huge columns.. part of a well defined exotic style.
As for the rest of the hotel a 5 star would be all right.
The spa treatments were very far from what we expected but the indoor pool which we visited is very nice and everybody is kind and helpful. We noticed with surprise that at certain times of the day the elevators are too crowded and the elevator waiting time could reach 15 minutes which is a lot.  There are six huge elevators but they are not enough. I totally understand that large groups of people come to visit the famous building, but maybe assigning at least two elevators for exclusive use of guests would always assure a more logical waiting time during peak hours. These are the two things I think that could be improved, as for the rest, I just have to thank all the people that make us live this arabian, unreal, three -night crazy dream.","5","2012-01"
"Over the Top","Awesome view.  The hotel is over the top.  they really try to bring the traditions of the country to light.  When you enter the lobby a staffer greets you personally and serves Dates.  The decor was over the top and oppulent.  The view from the elevator is gorgeous.","5",
"Wedding Anniversary at Burj","During our stay at Mina A'Salam in December 2011 we spent one perfect day at Burj Al Arab to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We chose Honeymoon Pack which included a welcoming bottle of wine, a plate of fruits and a bouquet of roses, as well as massage for two, aroma bath and dinner at Al Muntaha restaurant. 
The two butlers we had (one was for the day time and the other one for night period) were really helpful and friendly and also was the girl concierge.
The hotel itself is really amazing and breathtaking, the suite is VERY impressive. We were greatly touched by a special anniversary cake and a bouquet of red roses which were presented by our butler, the flowers on the bed were also charming. During check out we received a nice personal gift from the hotel  - two towels with satin-stitch of our names on them. 
Burj is a place everyone should visit if only once. We enjoyed our romantic 1 day stay very much and I wish I had no complaints at all but I have actually.
1) We checked twice with the concierge at Mina A'Salam (she organized our day experience at Burj) and her colleague at Burj what the price would be. And we were given the amount with all taxes and fees. The same thing we heard during check-in. Therefore we were greatly suprised when we had to pay more at check-out. It took about 10 mnts to check everything and found out that we had not been told about one more tax (perhaps). It was not a tragedy but we would prefer to know about that in advance. 
We were met by a girl who spoke Russian upon arrival and we did not hear about some additional taxes from her as well (we did ask her about the total). Though everyone understands that staying at Burj Al Arab is more the matter of pleasure and unforgetable experience than the matter of money I would recommend the hotel management to inform their guests about such things in advance .
2) We were asked twice if we would like to have some Russian newspapers or magazines to read and both offers from the concierge were followed by our positive answers. As a result we were given none. 
3) Burj Al Arab is very popular in Russia and during some period up to 80% of the hotel's guests are Russian who do not speak fluent English. And if the hotel has a selection of DVD to choose some of them shoudl be available in Russian. I do not insist on every film but at least 5-7. I have checked the hotel's DVD from A to F and only English and Arab languages were available, no German, French etc. I also asked our butler to check available langusges but the result was the same - English, Arab and that's all.
I suppose your guests from other countries will be happy to watch a film in their native language if they want to. As for Russian films I will be happy to advise some if the hotel asks me :-)","4","2011-12"
"Burj A; Arab","Dubai is very well know for its hospitality. from my own personal experince, staff wasnt friendly at all.  maybe coz all celebrity stay at this hot spot they are not used to deal with ordinary people.","3",
"Most unique hotel on earth.","From the minute you arrive every aspect of this place impresses. The lobby, fountains, elevators and suites are as good as it gets. The service is impeccable from the greeters at the front door to the butlers and every member of staff we met. The concierge deserves special mention. We only had two days and they arranged a private car and guide that allows us to really get to see and understand Dubai. They were so helpful and gracious. The breakfast buffet by the pool is terrific. Yes it is desperately expensive but frankly completely worth it. ","5","2012-01"
"Top notch service!","Stayed a few nights at the Burj Al Arab.  Spectacular designed building like a sail ship.  Stayed in the Panorama Suite.  Was a 2 story Suite with a grand staircase.  Very opulent!   The service was impeccable.  There was a concierge on each floor and they would stand up every time we passed by and would walk with us to open our door when we were returning to the room.  A must is going to the restaurant Al Mahara in the hotel.  It has a spectacular Aquarium that you dine by.  Everyone is dressed to the nines at this hotel, so come prepared with very nice clothes.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and nice to eat outside with the nice weather.  There is a separate gym area for men and women.  Nice steam room and pool for just women.  If going to Dubai, you must stay at this hotel even if it's only once in a life time!","5","2011-12"
"Amazing!","I'm going to make it short:

FABULOUS!!!!!

everything is designed to make you go back, perfect service, high standards.

The pick up from the airport, they walk in, the service, the little attentions, the architecture.... everything till the smallest detail is studied and nothing goes by the eye of the staff.

Have a crush!","5","2011-11"
"Out of this world place to stay..!","This is truly the place to stay and would be the place to stay in any country if it were there...  Although, it just seems like it is in the perfect place..!  Back on my first stay in 2006 tourist could still go in to check it out...  When there in 2009 this was no longer the case...  You would at least need a dinner or bar reservation to get on the property...  You cannot go wrong in any of the rooms here as all is 1st Class+..! Even the little things such as toiletries which are full size Hermes for both men and women specially packaged for the Burj Al Arab...  Service is without a doubt the best you will find anywhere...  You just won't feel like you on a holiday, you will feel like you have truly gotten away from everything..!","5","2011-02"
"A memorable anniversary","It’s not because of its incredible position amongst the warm blue waters of the Arabian Gulf; it’s not because of its amazing atrium, leaving you breathless in the very moment you walk across the turning door of the main entrance; it’s not because of its huge suites and unparalleled service that Burj Al Arab is considered the most luxurious hotel in the world.
There is much much more. 
My husband and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary at the Burj Al Arab, last October. It was a memorable experience. Even if it was not the first time there, we had the best time ever.
Every staff member seems to be there only for you, ready to fulfill everything you may desire, wish or request. They seem to know exactly WHAT you need WHEN you need and they give you before you ask. Especially your personal butler. We are very grateful to Gautam, the most efficient and nice butler in the world!!! Thank you very much for everything. It wouldn’t have been the same without you! 
On the day of our anniversary, we had the luck to meet the Executive Chef of the hotel, Mr Maxime Luvara; we talked to him for a while, complimenting him on the very high level of the hotel food. He’s such a beautiful person, and few hours later he had the exquisite idea to send to our suite a wonderful tray of delicious home-made chocolates as a personal gift for us. 
We also had a romantic dinner on the sand: oh! the most romantic movie you could have seen is nothing compared to that.
As we arrived to the beach restaurant, we were driven through a path of carpets, that leaded us to the shore where a table had been laid for us among torches and ballons. 
Flowers and a music added a special touch to that wonderful atmosphere.  
Dinner was fantastic and service impeccable. The chef himself came out to be ensured by us that everything was fine.
We were given a wonderful anniversary cake, and once came back to our suite another surprise was prepared by the butler and his assistant: a cake and roses on the bed.
That’s to say how special and pampered you will feel in this amazing hotel, and you will find it since the magic moment  you pass through the Welcome Center check-in point, you give your name and you are entitled to cross the bridge which sets the Burj Al Arab apart, not only from the other hotels, but from the rest of the world.","5","2011-10"
"nice place for visiting","the view on the hotel is cool, but we liked more the near area of jumeira beach with the view on Burj Al Arab.","4",
"HMMMM.....","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab on the very last night of our month long wedding/honeymoon tour, having married in Sri Lanka in November.  The hotel itself is ....interesting....  I have never seen anything like it - and it really is a monument to bad taste!!!  Our room was huge, on two levels and almost everything appeared to have been gold plated....  The service was good but not great, and certainly not even 5 star really.  Having said that the meal we had in the underground restaurant, looking at the fabulous aquarium, was very good indeed food wise, although they did forget one of the items we ordered, which we didn't think was great from this standard of hotel.  The Sky Bar was a great experience and the Top of The World cocktail was very good - although at around £50 each we would expect them to be!!!  

When we left, our bill wasn't ready for us, then we had to wait around for 10 minutes for our bags to be collected from our room - although we had told them that we were leaving 3 hours previously!  

All in all, not a great experience, but I suppose one of things you have to do once in a lifetime!","3","2011-12"
"grotesk but worth the one night experience","the best hotel in the world ? maybe when it is all about luxury. the taste off the furniture in the suites is rich Arabic. zen is different. stark is very different. to each one his own views for what good taste represents. staying here for a long time would be indecent . you are not in connection with the real world anymore.","5","2011-02"
"Good, but not the best.","We had a 5 night romantic refreshment stay to recharge our batteries, this hotel looks great from the outside but i feel the staff follow the ""guidebook"".
Knowing a guests name and remembering how they prefer a drink is nothing special in a decent hotel, we got the feeling that the staff never appeared relaxed, at times timid or scared of getting something wrong. Three staff asked for  a mention on the guest comment forms, why?
The pool staff were exceptional, room cleaning teams were exceptional but this hotel just is not as good as it would like to think. We have stayed in better hotels with a more relaxed aura, a hotel can be formal and stunning but the staff are what matters and having stayed in some of the worlds best hotels, this one with its claim of ""the most luxurious hote in the world"" is not in my experience, the best.
It has a stange ""fakeness"" about it, too much falseness, smiling and bowing. It was written on the wall when were met at the door with the greeting ""welcome home"", i felt nauseous,,,,,
Strangely enough, the only time i was ""genuinely"" asked about our stay was in the Rolls when we left, the driver was a smashing chap once he relaxed and he understood and maybe agreed on my thoughts.","4","2011-12"
"great hotel","suites are excellent. so is service. however food not to the same standard. The after noon tea is one of its own world wide. should not miss. all that live music and snacks. what i did not like was the bar on top floor. its glass obscures a great sea view at night, its ceiling unnecessarily colourful.","4",
"An experience","Very beautiful hotel with great space in the rooms, very original colour schemes, it isn't like every other hotel room. The food and spa in the hotel are amazing as well as the private beach and breakfast dining only possible down side being that the staff can be slightly stifling.","4","2011-10"
"*******PERFECT*******","The worse thing about this hotel is having to leave! We have stayed in hotels all round the world and I try to only book the very best. This hotel is something different, the attention to detail, weather it's dinning, service or views, is unreal!! I don't know how they could have made our stay feel any better or special. The quality of everything is 7star! If your thinking of staying here, then don't think just book, the experience is worth more than anything. You also get special treatment away from the hotel, it seems if people know your staying here they can't do enough for you, this hotel has great respect. I would and will defiantly be going back in the near future.

Thank you for meeting all our expectations!!

"Sailboat Hotel","Hotel made to look like a sailboat sitting in the bay.  Entrance is for guests only.  Managed to get in by attending a $185 lunch!
Extravagence is taken too a way too high standard.","5",
"Over Glam","Every city has a signature building, instantly recognizable from all over the globe, Big Ben in London, Empire State in New York, Eiffel Tower in Paris, Dubai has of course the Burj Al Arab, or the Burj Khalifa???

Built on artificial land, some 280 meters off shore, the architecture is stunning and an engineering feat! At 321 meters high, the Burj Al Arab is bigger than the Eiffel Tower. 

I was very excited to come to Dubai to see the Burj Al Arab, having read so much about it, but I must say I was a bit disappointed. The hotel is much more beautiful on the outside then on the inside. There were a lot of tourist taking photos and kids running around (Not exactly what you would expect of a so claimed 7 star hotel!

Whilst rated as the world's most luxurious hotel, I personally did not find it to my liking! Snotty staff, over glam and slightly tasteless!","3",
"A must do","The burj Al Arab has to be one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever been in. The food is extremely expensive though. £220 for a 3 course meal for 2 with coffee. The food wasnt the best considering the price but was worth it just to have the experience.","5",
"great for photos from the outside","Bookings only for this hotel, no walk up aloud, overpriced and very gold inside but what did you expect for a 7 star hotel. Park on a side road o the public beach for great photos","4",
"Engagement","We stayed in the Panoramic suite in March 2011 when I proposed to my girlfriend. Everything about the hotel was luxury! The attention to detail (like most places in Dubai) was amazing. The check-in was quick and personal, taking place in our suite. The butler was on hand when we needed him, and he even came and poured us a complimentary cocktail in our room. The room itself was very impressive, with amazing views over the ocean and the Dubai skyline. The service on the private beach was wonderful and made us both feel very special. The hermes toiletries went down a treat.
Breakfast was served in our suite, which we ordered over the phone whilst in bed. Everything about our stay there was perfect and we will definitely be returning again in the near future!","5","2011-03"
"Wow, still cannot believe we were staying there for 2 days","At this point we still cannot believe that we actually stayed at the magnificent Burj Al Arab
we truly have never seen such an amazing hotel before.
But not only the location, the hotel, our tremendous panoramic suite with such an amazing view, and everything that comes with it has brought to us this priceless feeling but it is thanks to the people we met that we felt and still feel so privileged.
Thank you Miss Rupinder Kaur, it was such a pleasure meeting you, thank you for taking care of our reservation
every single detail was perfect arranged, thank you for your time answering all my questions, thank you for your emails and patience with me,  we do hope we will meet again, soon.
Thank you Paul and your colleague for taking care of us, we had never "" a butler "" in our lives before and in the beginning it felt so strange but you became a dear friend, thank you for making us feel so comfortable. 
Thanks to our chauffeurs who picked us up at the ship and brought us when we left to the airport, I must say that we were a little embarrassed when they bowed for us but I was so charmed when he gave me a bouquet of red roses on arrival.
Thanks to the people at our floor's reception desk, I am so sorry that I cannot remember all  your names, after a few seconds it felt like you knew us for ages, you were all so kind to us.
Thank you Steven it was nice talking to you we wish you a great life in Dubai "" het gaat je goed ""
Thank you for the spa treatment, thank you for the wonderful dinner, thank you for preparing the most relaxing Jacuzzi we ever had 
thank you for those uncountable roses ( my bouquet survived the flight home ), the delicious cake, the afternoon delight, and so many many more 
We arrived home and we need to see our photos to believe that this was for real  we do believe that we come back and stay a little longer !","5","2011-12"
"The most luxurius and safe hotel I've ever been.","You will be scandalised by how much luxury is gathered in one place.They worth every penny of their money.Their best advantage it's not the luxury but the stuff which is indeed a 6 star stuff.And of course the food.","5","2011-04"
"An unforgettable experience!","It was our 20 year wedding anniversary and my husband suprised me by splurging out and taking me for a night in the honeymoon suite at the Burj! Wow! What a spoil!!! Attention to detail is remarkable and dinner was superb! Massage at the magnificent spa, Hermes toiletries, personalised towels, champagne are just a few of the gifts you receive when booking this suite! Views are amazing and it's not voted the most luxurious hotel in the world for nothing! A must have once in a lifetime experience!","5","2011-11"
"Overrated...","From the overly ornate (tacky expensive bling) to the incredibly expensive food & drinks - this may be a current icon of Dubai, but it's really an exercise in excess. Great location, decent service, but the Jumeriah Beach hotel next door offers, IMHO, better value for the money. Stay @ Jumeriah Beach, and have a cocktail in the Burj - best of both worlds!","3",
"Best of the best !","This hotel bills itself as ""the most luxurious hotel in the world"" and it truly is !
It is as though the management visited all the finest hotels in the world and learned what makes them the best - then they brought all these ideas back and even improved upon them.
The private location, the tight security,and the multitude of staff make it see very personal for a large hotel.  All staff members address the guests by name almost immediately.  The facilities (especially the private beach) are second to none.  The rooms are fabulous, large and posess eery possible amenity - and then some.  Service in this hotel is spelled with a capital ""S"".  No detail is overlooked.
My wife didn't want to leave.  She wanted to forget the rest of our three week holiday in other places and just stay here.  She said: ""You go ahead and pick me up on the way home"".
The positive aspects of this hotel are simply too numerous to list;  the negative aspects are virtually nonexistent.
For the person who has everything and for someone who wants the best of the best, a stay at The Burj will not disappoint.","5","2011-12"
"A Royal Experience","As soon we stepped into the hotel, we were immediately greeted. The attendants knew our names right away and offered us a drink. We quickly got checked in with suites right next to each other. The butler was very informative, he taught us how to use the high tech curtains and television systems. 

The bathroom facilities were incredible. There was a nice big jet tub with seperate showers. The amenities were well stocked and nice. 

Once we entered the room there were fresh fruits, dates, and wine. Service was always available, we had a concierge on every floor. 

It was very close to the water park which was included with our room rates. 

We dined in Junsui for lunch which is an asian inspired buffet. We though that it was quite over priced for the food we had ($100 CAD/person) which wasn't a lot. We were from a city with lots of asian cruisine so I guess we were quite picky on what we consume. 

The price for the room and food were very expensive but it comes with amazing service and amenities. It is definately a once in a lifetime experience.","4","2011-08"
"Hw to minimise ur Budget & enjoy best of Al Arab","Best in dubai along Al khalifa ^ Atlantis.Doesn,t matters whether u r in US,UK or whichever part of the world.Be ready to experience the middle eastern hospitality.Now I don’t wish to write the beauty & other facilities as there are plenty of reviews mentioning it.I would just describe what best can u do while in Al Arab & save costs (haha.)  with no compromise on hospitality.

Rooms : Suite Room is quite good.Jacuzzi,Hot water, paintings,L shaped sofas,Room bar..u name it, u have it.One should book the lowest category room as it is as good as the other rooms until off course you are not Howard Hughes or Bill Gates.

Food : Dinner at Al Mahara, one of the several restaurants, is the Best.You don’t want to gulp in the usual breakfast down Europe or in US.Try there specialities: Camel Meat served with champagne , Roasted kababs & a lot more.

Bookings : Trust me this is most crucial part. A US or UK booking agent can put you in a real soup.Try booking from a third party provider from Asian countries.They usually have  a cheap deal for the same room & services wth a less markup.One can easily save a 25-30% costs.I booked thru antilogvacations.com , an Indian travel agent.The rates were much cheaper.

Tour Plans :
My advice, go for a consolidated deal rather than hotel bookings alone.Booking from hotel is again very very costly.Pick a dealer & book the whole tour package like pick drop from airport,sightseeing,Meal plans & hotel.Its convenient & cheap.

Just a walkdown from hotel , u ve many restaurants that serve terrific Arabic food.You can’t afford to miss that.”A Shama” & “Al Bake” r the 2 I remember.

And yes, do not forget to go on Dhow cruise, its good riding scooters in sand..lol

Al Arab matches Al khalifa & is a touch better in my opinion.I trusted reviews & they dint proved me wrong.Kudos to hotel & management.","5","2011-12"

"Most amazing Hotel!","My husband I just recently got back from Burj Al Arab and all I can say is WOW! Truly a unique and unbelievable experience!

Thank you again to the staff at the Burj Al Arab.","5","2011-12"
"Royal feeling","It is royal luxury. Great rooms. Great service.

They served me Indian food in my room, though it was not on their menu. Just to suffice my needs they had an Indian chef, catering to our needs.

VIP treatment in waterpark. No waiting in the queue.","5","2011-12"
"Read up before coming","to fully appreciate the awe that is the construction behind this iconic ""sail"" in the middle of the sea, i would suggest watching a documentary or reading up on this. I watched a documentary on the building of this several years back and increased my experience and awe when i visited the hotel for the Afternoon tea at sky view bar (separate review). 

The interior is very different from the exterior and it decorated with the Sheikhs favorite colors. quite loud and not the ""usual"" neutral color scheme but its memorable!

the fountain at the entrance is worth staring at for a few minutes.","5",
"Culinary Flight Experience","My wife and i stayed at the Burj for two nights 30th June to 1st July this year at the start of our 25th Wedding Aniversary to the Seychelles.I can honestly say that this grand hotel is bigger and better than you can imagine.Brilliant architecture and enormous duplex rooms.
The Culinary Flight Experience is a must if you are here for just a short stay. How does it work? Well as there are several fine dining restaurants located on different floors each with a wow factor but you only have one evening to try them all , well you can. The hotel arrange for you to have each of your 6 courses at different dining venues within the hotel. Its an amazing experience they even ensure that your open bottle of wine is transported to the next dining venue. No rush we took a leisurely 4 hrs.Worth every second.","5","2011-06"
"Stylish in its opulent kitsch.","We have just spent a night there celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel turned out to be the perfect setting. It is outlandish and its style is a mixture of 1001 styles. Nothing matches with anything. Disastrous sense of design... And that's the whole point! It is a colourful fantasy that makes one laugh - i.e inspire good mood. 

The service (accross the board) is impeccable. It was the first time ever that even a valet greeted me remembering my surname. 

The panoramic views from every suite are to die for. 

The suites (apart from terrible, tacky yet colourful decor) offer a great degree of privacy. They feel very spacious because of split level (bedroom, dressing room, master bathroom located upstairs). Non alcoholic drinks in two minibars are free and your dedicated valet replenishes them when requested. Hermes toiletries (full size bottles for him and her) are a really nice touch indeed. We also loved proper, large jacuzzi big enough for the two of us. 

Unfortunately the living room furniture layout does not make the most of the panoramic views. For some odd reason designers chose to position the L-shaped sofa back to the full height window. If we stayed more than a  night we would have reconfigured the layout so that one could admire the sea. The design is completely detatched from the breathtaking architecture. There is no link between the two.  

Breakfast buffet was disappointing because it offered only boring, standard international choices. I was expecting something more adventurous. It is also very pricey (AED500.00) for what it is. I saw no vegetable juices, no soya milk, oats. Exactly the same breakfast costs up to 8 times less in other hotels. While I am prepared to pay a high rate for a room (aforementioned one of a kind experience) breakfast needs to improve. 

All in all I strongly recommend this place. It is a lively icon to bad taste. It welcomes you with open heart and makes you feel so comfortable you don't want to check out.","5","2011-12"
"Fantastic Place","Fantastic place 6th floor great views of the city, very small pool, we had to go over to the Jameriah beach to enjoy their pool bar and fab beach. We had a great time, but would not go back as we enjoyed the Jameriah beach more. We celebrated our 25th anniversary there a lot of money not a lot of food.","5","2011-02"
"not the best","we stayed here for my 40th and the room was out of this world but thats where it ends. The pool is very small and basic and the food was average","4","2010-12"
"Smoking!","We had a fantastic high tea at the burj Al Arab Hotel.  Fantastic staff and excellent service.  We came back outside to get the car from the valet parking and found at least 10 people smoking at the main enterance to a 7 star hotel.  It is disgusting that we had to walk through their smoke!
Really lowered the tone of the hotel in our opinion!","3","2011-10"
"Greatttt. SD.biswas","Burj Al Arab is probably Dubai's most iconic tower and it revels in its satisfaction to dazzle tourists who venture for a photograph in its scenic background or patrons who would love to spend a weekend in the 5 star suite.

"minid blowing!","beautiful place to relax, we had a panoramic suite on floor 9. views of dubai were beautiful. The Suite was incredible, so much room! the bathroom had hermes aftershave which I am now hooked on! We were treated very well by all staff as expected. The only gripe I have is the fact that the pool facilities are not great and we found ourselves using the neighbouring hotels pools and facilities! All in all an amazing place to stay, even if you only do it once. Yeah its expensive, but dont moan about the price when you are staying in one of the best hotels in the world!","5","2010-12"
"being the monkey in the zoo","I'm staying approx. 250 nights each year in hotels, places like the Mandarin Orientel in Hongkong, the St. Regis in Washington... so real luxury hotel. Therefore I've been very interested about our 4-day stay at the 'Burj al Arab', the (as the say) most luxurious hotel on this planet. So expectations where high, above Mandarin Oriental, Anantara, W, Shangri-La, St. Regis etc.

But what 'Burj al Arab' delivered was just a sad story, reminded me much more on a 3* Disney World Sheraton than on a 5* hotel.

Beside some below standard room features (bathroom without window, no rain-shower, no mirror for shaving inside the shower cabin, no iPod connection to the room audio system) the biggest problem is that you're living in a tourist attraction... There're basically thousands of Chinese people on a package-tour around you, wearing pyjamas for breakfast.... very low class. And of course they're everywhere, making photos, standing at the entrance waiting for the tour bus... Basically you have to push them away to make your way.

Further the service (beside the butler & concierge service) is sub-par. When you need your car it takes ages because so many tour busses are blocking the way to the hotel entrance and so many people waiting at the entrance, hundreds! If you need the free buggy to the beach... wait, wait, wait.

The Burj Beach is another joke. Cheap beds, no style, no flair. At the beach restaurant the food is just horrible, tasteless... I've eaten better sandwiches at McDonalds! And of course the service is poor, you have to wait & wait & wait. The Burj pool is okay for a 4* hotel - but for sure not for the 'most luxurious hotel'. 

Skip breakfast, even it's included in your room rate. The pool restaurant very much reminds me to a standard Sheraton, at the Asian breakfast room - which is a bit better - you'll have to get used to guests wearing pyjamas & hotel slippers.

I just do have the feeling that this hotel, in order to make money, is overloaded with sightseeing tourists who are allowed to enter the hotel when they have lunch/afternoon tea/dinner. Even the upper lobby is converted to an Indian restaurant to cater the Indian sightseeing tourists. The staff isn't prepared for such a load - and therefore the guests have to wait & wait & wait. 5* Service is different.

Closing I have to say that they really were trying to do something exceptional, with the Sky bar, the fantastic view from the room, the room features... But due to the overload of sightseeing- & package tourists it's not better than 'The Swan' at Disney World Orlando - but much higher priced.","2","2011-11"
"A place to visit","We had excellent experience visiting this Hotel which was filled with Buzz.

We went to the Sky Tower to have drinks and snacks which was obviously expensive. Minimum spend was £50 per person. Anyhow we enjoyed the experience.

The decor of the Hotel reflected the local culture and the carpets laid down were like a sponge. You could comfortable sit or lie down on the floor; though this would not be allowed

A very posh Hotel","4",
"Everything incredible!","This place is incredible, from the insane views to the excellent food and service.  Greeted by Rolls Royce to personal service 24/7 for all of your wants and needs.  Price tag matches the opulent insanity, but worth every dime!  ENJOY","5","2010-12"
"Amazing but...","Offers the best of everything but any stay is always somewhat spoilt by the fact that they allow hoards of non residents onto the property. Can be frustrating when having to wait for a car or buggy transfer or when trying to get a drink in the sky view bar - surely residents paying seven star money should have some sort of priority?","5","2011-06"
"A building from 1001 nights","Me and my wife, we've impressed about the very tall lobby, the big lateral aquariums - close to the escalators, and, of course about the Al Muntaha restaurant (it was a special review written by me about this restaurant).","5",
"Without question, one of the finest hotels in the world - certainly the best service","When the smallest room (suite) in the hotel is larger than the average family home and the fleet of white Rolls Royces outside are in constant use, you know you've found a special hotel. And, special it indeed is.

Let's deal with some negatives first:
Pool area is small
Spa area is small (one jacuzzi and one very small pool)
Food quality is average in some restaurants, very good in others
The cost is extortionate (can often get free half-board deals)

And then the positives:
The staff are quite amazing
The butler actually finds ways to make himself useful rather than (in other hotels) just making the odd cup of tea.
The staff on your floor all know you by name, open door to the suite, book anything at all for you, all reservations, sort out transfers etc.
The Asian buffet is superb
The top-floor bar is great fun
Location is amazing
Views from room are amazing
Rooms are huge (smallest suite 160m2)
""Free"" Hermes aftershave/soap/eau de toilette etc included in the room
High speed internet through the hotel, incl laptop supplied in the room
Buggy transfer to Madinet (really nice area adjacent to hotel), offering 45 restaurants, Venetian lagoon, beach bar, further 1,000 or so hotel rooms 

All in all, I'll definitely return to this hotel, primarily for the guaranteed relaxation you'll get from having the finest customer service within the staff I've ever witnessed from a hotel.

"One night in heaven... sadly not 1001 nights!","This was truly an amazing time. I was staying elsewhere in Dubai for my first two and last two nights of my visit. I was collected from my residence by my chauffeur in my BMW7, and driven to the hotel. I was warmly greeted by Nermeen and taken to my suite. It was light and spacious, overlooking Jumeirah Beach Hotel. The butler then came to show me how everything in the room worked etc. I had a great package direct from the Burj, with spa, dinner and breakfast included. I decided to have lunch there as well, as the buffet was amazing with plenty of lobster, prawns, oysters as well as the best satay I have ever had. I also had a great time at Wild Wadi over the causeway! All in all, one of the best days of my life!","5","2011-08"
"Wow!","What a special stay!!! Unlike any other hotel experience I've ever had. Service is impeccable. They can't do enough for you. Rooms are massive and have incredible views. 

They really go out of their way to make your stay special. We went on Christmas and they sent Santa to the room with a sleigh fill of candy and gifts for the kids. It was a family member's birthday during out stay as well and they sent to the room a full sized cake and a guitarist along with some staff singing happy birthday. 

Simply amazing stay. I would love to go back anytime!","5","2010-12"
"worth to be the only 7 star hotel","worth to be the only 7 star hotel. the view.. the service. the options..the entertainment.. awesome.Once inside we were greeted politely by a member of staff and we made our way up to the 27th floor to the restaurant. The water features inside are lovely and the decoration is unique. 
We had light supper at sky bar. But the other restaurants also looked very nice, it was hard to have a proper look around as it was so busy, and the majority aren't exactly polite. 
We were greeted in the restaurant and taken to our table which had a lovely view of the palm and the Atlantis hotel which was stunning in the night all lit up. However, some table don't seem to have the best view as some guests came in but asked to be moved which the staff seemed to have no issue with so make sure you get a good view. 

This building is truly one of the most fascinating structures of the world.

You will rarely find a picture of the Burj from the sea side looking inward towards the land. This is because the structure resembles the Christian cross. This doesn't fit well in a predominantly Islamic region.
The Burj stands on an artificial man made island. The road you see connecting the Burj to the mainland is how you get to it. 
Rolce Royce picks you up and takes you to the Burj during your stay at the hotel.

The Burj has a beautiful view  inside. Those fountains you see are everywhere and they are automatic. They put on a nice dance show.
The patterns you see on the wall are all made of real gold. 

The helipad high up top the Burj. Many athletes have gone up here and played games. Tennis players like Andre Agassi and golfers like Tiger Woods have all hit balls from top far into the water.","5","2011-11"
"A Nice hotel which charges high","we went to stay at Burj - Al Arab which claims to be the only 7 star hotel in the world. It is a bit expensive for the service it provides, but worth a night's stay. The over do with golden colour looks good sometimes. also indian food options were good. The north indian and south indian thali options at breakfasts was a good idea.","4","2011-11"
"amazing hotel","we stayed in this hotel about a year ago. my god this hotel is breath takeing. everything about it wow. the resturant down strairs that is surranded by water is amazing and the resturant up stairs is amazing. you are able to use the water park in the hotel beside it. best hotel ever.","5","2010-12"
"A true flagship","It was my third stay at the Burj since 2007 and the outstanding quality of this hotel does not change at all - although there seems to be a lot of new staff. From the service point of view, it feels like a visit to a well run private country house - especially due to the well trained staff helping guests with anything they might possibly need: packing & unpacking luggage, pressing clothes etc. Every room is assigned a ""butler"", who in technical terms of course isn't a butler but a valet (women get assigned a maid - in Burjspeak ""female butler""). Those employees really know what they are doing and meanwhile I suspect that they actually and honestly enjoy being able to use their skills that would otherwise secure a well paid position in any big private household. If there is nothing else you can think of to make your stay more pleasant - do at least ask your butler to pack your luggage - you will arrive home with clothes that look like you have just bought them in a shop - crisp and wrapped up in silk paper.

I am aware that comparing a hotel of this size with a country house sounds bizarre, but thanks to the separate reception and dedicated staff on every floor, it is easy to forget about the size of the hotel - unless you want to look up or down the inner cavity of the building that is (not for people scared of heights).

There is a lot of criticism online about the hotel interior design. Apart from the fact, that it is so-Nineties (you can see from the design of the one-for-all remote controls in the rooms, how quickly once cutting-edge electronic devices become antiquated nowadays), such criticism is based on a misunderstanding and is also unfair. Yes - it's full of gold and colours and there is water everywhere - but this is the Emirati idea of paradise! They have been for centuries living in desert environment where all colours are rock, sand and the sea. Of course they love colours, glitter and water. To create such environment is their idea of perfect hospitality, not a tacky attempt to impress. Also, unlike in Vegas, whatever looks like gold there IS gold and all the ornaments are from highest quality materials. So I can find no fault with trying to offer their guest only the best - although according to local custom.

In my view, the only major setback at this hotel is related to its location: there is no beach directly at the Burj. There are countless buggies to take the guests across the pier to the hotel's own strip of the Jumeirah beach. But if you travel with children - how happy will you be to call a buggy and return back to, say, the 25th floor in order to fetch that inflatable dinosaur your son has forgotten in the room? For families with children, the beach villas at the neighbouring Madinat Jumeirah are a much better option - and you can always call a buggy a drive over to the Burj for meals if you want.

Speaking of which - the hotel breakfast is spectacular, all other meals I have had there were of decent but not of astounding quality. Somehow the overall standard of this place makes you expect the exceptional in every respect, so the good somehow doesn't feel good enough. Then it's time for a reality check: did you honestly go to that restaurant with a simulated submarine ride, 15 ft glass aquarium windows and tropical fish swimming right in front of your nose because you're such a gourmet?","5","2011-09"
"Seeing is believing","This was our second visit this year and you never think it could better.....wrong because it does and exceeds each trip. There has been a big change in staff since our first visit in 2000 and have all gone to other Jumeirah hotels nearby which to me tells a tale that promotion beckoned and rightly so. This hotel is very expensive and as the saying goes you only get what you pay for but in my eyes you get a lot more than that in the Burj. We ate in Junsui, Bab Al Yam and Al Iwan (read my review of Al Iwan). Thanks to all the chefs in each venue for the special treatment we were given and the managers also of each venue who became our friends and the staff throughout from the florist who always made me a lovely posy every day, housekeeping who made our room up to a fantastic standard, our butlers and a big thanks to Marianne for all her help as was a bonus and dealt with us soooo kindly. Lastly Mohammed in Bab Al Yam who was just a star and look forward to seeing you all at Christmas.","5","2011-08"
"Over the top is an understatement","This is the epitome of exaggeration.  It lacks elegance, taste and the refinement of moderation.  Too much is going on all the time, at all places.  Not that service is bad or inefficient, rather too many people all over. Good architecture, barroque decoration, excessive gilded surfaces, unnecessary trompe l´oeil in columns, overwhelming fish tanks, fountains, glittering elevators.  Las Vegas meets no-spending-limits...","1","2011-10"
"WOW","Frm the minute your car pulls into the hotel property thru the gate they make you feel sssssoooo special...and as your entourage of staff sweep you into your suite where they ck you in and you are left to wonder ""is this for real""....

they leave NTHING to chance...every possible whim is addressed ""Immediately"" if not sooner...

I was an invited guest of HRH Cr. Prince but i think that even if i was not it would still have been just as special....have been back a few times and cant really find anything to possibly complain about...go at Xmas time when they try and out do the world...lol

"Possibly one of the most iconic buildings in the world","Still a stunning building and still awesome inside! So over the top it takes your breath away .... well worth a visit at least - but better still experience staying here for the sake of being able to compare all other hotels to this one in the future. The suite that we had was beyond anything I had experienced before. Just absolutely living up to it's seven star rating.","5",

"Billionaires: Frankincense and Myrrh: Burj al Arab","My husband and I having just disembarked the Silversea Wind and needed to spend a night in Dubai before the next leg of our amazing adventure in the Middle East.  My Hubby always said if we are ever in Dubai, he wanted to stay at the Burj al Arab, just like the Billionaires of the world and extra splurge on the Rolls Royce Phantom Private Car Transfer from the ship to the hotel.
So we did just that!! 
Wow, what an experience....was it worth the hideous cost?? If it is a dream come true, then yes....after all it is only money!! 

A top drawer experience from the second your foot hits then end of the red carpet laid out at the pier just for us....The driver greeted me with a bouquet of Red Roses!! Opened our doors, placed our luggage in the trunk and off we went.  I couldn't help noticing the envious stares and people looking at us wondering who in the heck we are to warrant such attention....little did they know that for the mere cost of maxing out their credit card, they too could be treated like a billionaire!!

A very leisurely drive to the Burj Al Arab, stopping for photos of ourselves with the famous Burj in the background enroute...wanted to make sure I had photos of the big splurge!!

When we pulled up in front of the Burj al Arab, our doors simultaneously magically opend by white gloved attendants, a smiling beautiful young woman welcomed us by NAME! Next we were offered (and needed!!) a warm rolled wet cloth to wash our hands and we were offered a tiny glass of Hibiscus flower juice...divine!! 

Without even checking in we were escorted to our floor, introduced to our Butler who took us to our room where the adventure began......

The Burj al Arab , known as the BAA, is the most opulent, luxurious hotel we have ever stayed  in. Each room is a suite of rooms spread over 2 floors with  a curving staircase joining the two floors.
All done in marble, gold leaf, rich blue and gold decor, huge living area, bar, complete office and equipment, Hermes Amenities, upstairs is huge bedroom with all the technological thiings a person can think of! A bathroom you could live in with beautiful painted frescoes on the walls.
 
It took our Butler about 15 minutes just to explain how to work everything...even the door unlocked by remote control and shows who is at the door on the tv screen. 
From our room you could see Palm Island and The World....other than to look around a bit at the hotel, we didn't leave our HUGE ROOM!!! We savored every second and enjoyed our big splurge.....it will take 2 years to pay off the credit card but it was worth it!! 

How did we get to do all this?? Thanks to our wonderful Travel Agent, Linda at TravelWizard.com who helped our dream come true!!","5","2010-11"
"Amazing","I have stayed in some of the worlds best hotels, but this one is by far the best! The staff are the nicest people you will ever meet,and the hotel would do anything for you! The food is exceptional, and the complex is lovely! The rooms are amazing.you should visit this hotel if you get the chance it is absolute luxury!","5","2010-11"
"WoW! Is all I can say","I stayed here for two nights.  To say I was mesmerized by the size and beauty of my room would be an understatement.  My room was literally the size of a small home in the United States.  We had one of the locals show us around and tell us about the history of the hotel, the previous hotel on the site, and the oil tankers that were once in the area prior to the man made island being constructed. The hotel is absolutely fabulous!","5",
"Fascinating","One of the finest natures beauty in Dubai. The rooms are great which circulates as well. TheBathrooms i really liked the most and the Restaurant is amazing.","5",
"One for the bucket list","We have wanted to stay at the Burj since first visiting Dubai five years ago. We had previously stayed at Mina A Salaam and looking up at it from the beach we wondered what would it really be like to be a guest there. Well – now we know, it is a very different experience. 
We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite (thank you American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts). The room was enormous with two lounges, formal dining, a bar, kitchen and office area. A grand staircase led you to the two bedroom suites, which were bigger than most people’s lounges. We enjoyed the automation in the room including the multi-level lighting, the television coming out of the unit in the bedroom so as not to obscure the view. The extras in the room, including the beach bag, the jandals and the toiletries were great. 
We spent one day on the beach – you do have to go here by golf cart but this is not an issue and it was worth it to swim in the Arabian Sea. The beach staff are attentive and there is a regular supply of ice and iced water to keep you hydrated. We spent the other day by the pool and this was equally enjoyable – the staff at the pool were also excellent. We had two complimentary massages included in our rate and these were of a very high standard. The spa and indoor pool area was out of this world  - having the separate identical facilities for men and women. 
The only letdown was the food – the breakfasts were ordinary and we also did the Culinary Flight . The first course was excellent – but it was downhill from there and Junsui did not measure up at all. I was a bit disappointed by how this was handled both at the time and when we were subsequently asked about this by our butler. If I were doing it again I would eat one night at Al Muntaha and one night at Al Mahara. Our culinary highlight was room service – which was setup very elegantly in our formal dining room and served by a tuxedo clad waiter, the food was of a high standard. 
Our only other gripe was how long it took to clean the room but this is probably due to the fact that it is such a large apartment. The beds are very comfortable and the pillows are the best we have experienced. Turndown service was a treat – with unexpected little gifts left on the pillow, like a purse sized Hermes perfume.","5","2011-09"
"not for the money!","Ok so I didn't pay for this, and would not have- $2,000 per night is really hard to justify anywhere! So what do you get? A vast 2 level suite which is hard to use all of- expansive sea views, all necessary facilities, although I believe internal pool not much chop- I swam in the warm and safe ocean where I could see the sand the whole time!
Really not that special, hence my four stars. Of course it's better than that, but I just can't see the value. I would need it to be sub $500 before I would consider paying to stay there.","4","2011-04"
"Mixed opinion","The most luxurios hotel in the world we got there with such expectations after deciding that we had to stayed there for at least one night 
As you can expect the facilities the room, the private beach, sauna, spa, gym etc is just amazing luxurius every detail the architecture is very arabic very well put togheter it amazing how they mixed all the color and forms and still look so good
We had one problem the attitude of our so cold buttler was despicable they treat us very bad, I can not understand why I was so desapointment they had no right to treat us that way 
And wost thing is that we ask for a late check out at 4 pm, they said they can do 2 pm and the next day at 11 am called us and said that they changed their minds and check out time will be at 1 I could not believe it
If you take that experience apart is totally worth it but I have to tell you if I had to chose i will go back to the Armani where the attention of my life style manager as they called was impecable
I just finish reading some of the bad reviews just to se if some one had the same problem than me but most of them are because they don't let you inn unless you've a reservation for any of the restaurants or staying in some of the jumeirah hotels plz if you want to go consider this","4","2011-09"
"Stay away!!!!","After a wonderful 8 days in Jumairah Beach Hotel, in Beit al Bahar, the stay in burj al arab was a total disappointment.
The smiles are fake. The people are rude and everything is shabby and worn off.
The bed actually did smell!!!!!
The breakfast collection was not good and the inside infinity pool was very small ( why was it so small?!!! they had plenty of space!!!!) and the out side pool was also very small and a dead bird was stuck near the pool.
Nothing like it's name. If you want luxury stay in Beit al Bahar. You don't ever wanna leave.","1","2010-11"
"A one in a lifetime experience-worlds only 7 star hotel","Did a day with my friends where we had the 7 course Asian afternoon lunch and tea after a massage in the spa and relaxing time by the infinity pool before heading off for a day on a private beach overlooking the hotel. Meticulous attention to detail in its decor,care of its guests and amazing creations by the chefs","5",
"A disappointment","The staff where extremely rude, the did not even open the doors for me on arrival. The helicopter transportation is not worth it - being slow and noisy. The two bedroom deluxe suite is not worth the £17,000 The beach was packed and wild wadi was another disappointment. The only plus point was partner Zabeel Saray - in my eyes Dubai's best hotel !","2","2011-02"
"Worth every penny!","I stayed here for one night on our way back from the maldives on our honeymoon. From arriving to leaving everything was just perfect. We didnt even need a key to our room as everytime we wanted to get in our butler was there to let us in! The food was superb and i have never met such friendly staff. Its defintely not the cheapest of places but it was worth every single penny. I will be returning as soon as were back in dubai!!","5","2011-09"
"Wonderful stay","The Burj is a top class hotel, no doubt. I stayed there for four days in a three bedroom suite. There was plenty of room, and the all needs were clearly catered for. The only downside on the technology front was they had Bose sound systems, this needs to be upgraded. The restaurants were very good, I particuarly enjoyed Al Mahara, the fish restaurant. Is it expensive? Yes without doubt. But you should know that before you go there. Would I stay there again? Yes, without doubt. Its worth going even if its just for the experience.","5","2011-04"
"The Emperor's New Clothes","Remember the tale of the Emperor who had a suit made for him but which would be invisible to those who were not wise or cultured when infact the tailors had tricked him and he was actually naked?  The BAA is comparable to the Emperor, it believes it is the grand icon of all other hotels, a shining star of the hospitality industry, the truth is far from this.

The hotel maintains its reputation solely on the fact it charges so much for accomodation etc.  I paid 7500dirhams (approx $2,000) per night, this is an average rate for the hotel and when your paying that kind of money its very difficult to admit the place is mediocre at best.

The service is poor, the rooms lack atmosphere and are overdone, I booked a 'Panoramic Suite' and felt like I was in a goldfish bowl or a car showroom.  The constant upsells by the staff are tacky.  The restaurants (and I ate at all of them) are serving up poor quality food at ridiculous prices.  

I am a member of Jumeirah Hotels loyalty programme and this has to be the worst Jumeirah hotel I have ever stayed in.  There are much better hotels in Dubai even Jumeirah owned ones, the Arabian Suite at the Mina Salam a prime example and a fraction of the price of this 'smoke an mirrors' establishment.

If you really must stay here make sure its for 1 night then move onto one of the hundreds of better quality and less expensive hotels in Dubai.  Does this review make me the child in the crowd who shouted ""He's naked!"" :-)","1","2011-04"
"Amazing place. Like nothing else I've ever seen. Very unique experience.","A special place. The modern architecture , island location and classic decor mix together to create a very unique property the service is excellent (other than forgetting to deliver my requested newspaper every day. The food is fantastic at breakfast buffet and Jengsu asian restaurant (but quite expensive). Access to the other nearby jumeirah properties is a big plus. 
Views from room is unbeatable. Thank you. ","5","2011-09"
"AMAZING","Amazing Hotel , huge building but certainly not brash and also very intimate.
We had a fantastic time here,booked the honeymoon suite which was amazing,
Arrived by Rolls Royce phantom,Swiftly checked in and crashed out in the amazing bed

"The best","Realy the best hotel I have ever slept in. Its a 7* hotel and they meet all expectations. Duplex room 170m2 very nice view and Rolls Royce transport from and to the airport.","5","2010-12"
"The service is seven star.","Being an iconic symbol of modern Dubai we decided to stay here for our first visit to the country and see whether the hotel could live up to the seven star hype!

We decided to transfer in one of the hotel's Rolls Royce Phantoms. Much to the disappointment of the people outside the hotel, we were not famous. But it was certainly the most memorable taxi ride I've taken and a nice way to begin the stay.

Several staff greeted us as we entered the hotel. Bags were quickly taken away and dates, coffee and hot towels were offered. It was notable even at this early point that service was not at-all stuffy and, for a large hotel, had an unexpected personal touch.

We were taken on a leisurely tour en route to our room, and if the exterior of the hotel is beautiful, then the interior is best described as striking. It adds to the over the top experience however, with fish tanks either side of the lobby, a waterfall in the centre and a dizzyingly colourful ceiling far, far above. This was all topped off with pink Christmas trees when we stayed!

We were checked in inside the room (a nice touch) and offered further refreshments as if the journey in the lift might somehow have worn us out. The room was something else. We'd booked the cheapest, yet it was still on two floors with a grand staircase, a living room larger than my flat, a bathroom filled with ridiculously expensive products, free movies on the TV, and one whole wall was glass, giving us spectacular views of the city.

Exploring the hotel I was surprised at how small the grounds actually were. The hotel is on a tiny made-made island, so the pool and gardens have little space around the building to occupy. However, Jumeriah also own both hotels either side of the Burj, so the whole beach front is private and free to explore. Plus the Burj has it's own private beach for guests of that hotel only. Also, if the hotel's pool is too small for you, (or the sea too hot!) access to the Wild Wadi waterpark is part of the room rate and is at the bottom of the drive (journey via golf buggy). So for pool access that's what we used!

We decided to try the culinary flight for dinner. The idea is that you have a single course from each of the restaurants. It begins with pre-dinner drinks at Sky View Bar. The view over the city is spectacular, which is nice as it distracts from the odd interior decoration of the bar. First course is at Al Muntaha. The food here was good, but not memorable, but at least you still have the view. Second course is in Al Iwan. This restaurant is lovely. Nice decor, and the traditional food much more memorable. Third course is at Junsui, a Japanese restaurant. Food was good, but not that memorable and I'd rather have had another course at Al Iwan. But then, that is the point of the culinary flight - to try a bit of everything and see what you like. Next was Al Mahara which you arrive at via a submarine simulation - and for a moment you'll forget you're at dinner and think you're on a theme park ride. Yes, it is the single most surreal restaurant experience ever. The food here was good and dining in the middle of an aquarium was an experience. Finally dessert is taken in Sahn Eddar Lounge. This is an open lounge based above the lobby. The setting is relaxing and the food amazing! Overall, it's a great way to try out everything the hotel has to offer and a fun experience, the service too was friendly and professional. I just wouldn't consider it fine dining in terms of all of the food.

Over the couple of days that we were at the Burj we were made to feel more welcome than at any other hotel we've been to before. They seem to make a big hotel feel very personal and as if nothing is too much trouble.

So does it merit seven stars? I've been to better restaurants and I've been to hotels with a better sense of decor, but I've never been to a hotel where you're made to feel quite as special. So yes, it really does feel like a seven star experience and one we plan to do again.","5","2010-12"
"What's not to like ?","Just fabulous ! I have been to this hotel few times and it is the best ever ! Every is fantastic about it, the staff, the room, the service ! The decor is decadent and might seems a bit tacky to some but we are in Dubai !!!!! Of course the price is pretty high but compare to other hotel of the same standing you have an impeccable service, your own butler and every one is ever so nice. I just love this place !!","5","2010-11"
"Worth every penny!  Actually a great value for money..","I was fortunate to enjoy only two nights at this wonderful hotel from 11-13 August 2011.  My delight started with an airport transfer to the hotel in one of the hotels white Rolls Royces.  The package which I booked was called the Summer Dreams package which already included a BMW transfer, but I opted to pay for the Rolls transfer which was a great experience.  From the porter meeting us as we finished with customs and showing us to the Rolls where the driver was waiting with cold towels and water.  We were even given a menu to select our tastes in music for the ride to the Burj!
Upon arrival a team of staff were waiting to greet me and immediately took me up to my suite to commence check-in.  I must note that I arrived at around 7am and was allowed to check-in very quickly which I was most grateful.  Entering the hotel I was amazed at the waterfall, and the architecture, dancing waterfall and the sea of beautiful fish as I went up the escalator of the main lobby.
My room was a Panoramic Suite located on the 13th floor which had fantastic view looking over the Jumeriah Beach hotel, the entrance bridge to the Burj and of course the sea.  Everything in the room was working in perfect order and the orientation by the butler as to the operation of the controls was really easy to understand.  It does last for what seems 20-30 minutes, but I thought it was fun even after a long flight!  I knew they were going to do it, so I expected it.  He gave us the option of doing a quick explanation or allowing us to get some rest and then coming back later to explain the operations and gadgets of the room.  Your wish is there command!  The room and service was what I'd expected and the space was wonderful.  This hotel opened in December 1999 and let me tell you you'll see no sign of a chip on any furniture, wear and tear on any of the carpets or the such.  After the Burj, I stayed at the One & Only on the Palm which has been opened less than a year I believe and I could see evidence in some of the furnishings of wear and tear.  All of this to say that these workers are proud of this hotel and it shows.  Our evening butler was the best!  His attention to detail and professionalism went beyond anything I'd every experienced at any hotel anywhere!  In fact all of the staff were perfect during my stay.  Nothing is too much for them.  You don't even have to ask...they are that good!
You have a host of items available to you in the comfort of your suite such as FREE on demand movies (numerous selections), a free laptop (with free internet) which printer and fax machine all set up and ready to use on your desk, two mini bars with unlimited amounts of high end water, juices, sodas replenished daily for your consumption (FREE), full size his and hers Hermes cologne, perfume, body washes, etc, buggy service to other Jumeriah properties and Wild Wadi park which you have free entry for the duration of your stay.  
My only dislike would be the food.  I was expecting a bit more from the hotel in this category.  We had the buffet breakfast included in our package which was at the restaurant which overlooks the pool.  The food was tasty, but nothing special in my opinion with no grand presentation or enough choices.  Just my thoughts.  Also we had a free buffet dinner in the same place which was again ordinary.  We tried the restaurant Al Mahara which is accessed via a simulated submarine voyage.  This dining experience again didn't satisfy us in the least and it costs over $400.00 for two of us with one mixed drink apiece.  Maybe the chef was having a bad day, but we wouldn't spend this sort of money there again.  We enjoyed a nice lunch buffet at other Jumeriah properties during our stay for a quarter of the price and was very enjoyable.  I expressed my concerns to my butler regarding the restaurant experience and he immediately deleted the price of our dinner meal to just reflect our drinks.  We didn't expect this at all, but considering the costs and the fact that we didn't enjoy our meal, we graciously accepted the offer.  They were there to make our experience the best possible.  So while the food failed us, every other aspect of the stay was above the mark!  Plus there attention to your expressions of concerns are taking seriously and you're never put into a situation where you feel you have to argue your point or feel that no one cares.
Lastly, for those of you that feel 1,500-2,000 a night for a room is too much then I challenge you to look for a hotel suite in any major city in the world and compare the meters or sq feet of the room along with all the amenities which the Burj offer and you'll see that the Burj is actually a bargain.  You'll never get this type of individual service and attention which is effortlessly given to you when you occupy a suite at this hotel.  We'll be back soon!","5","2011-08"
"One of the best hotels in the world","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab in August 2011.  As you would expect, everything is over the top here, and that is part of the experience.  I would definitely want to stay here again, but there are so many other top-notch 5-star hotels in Dubai at 1/10 the price that I would probably stay elsewhere next time.  Here are some factual observations: 

1.  We booked through Amex Platinum and were upgraded to a 2-bedroom suite.  I can’t believe I’m saying this, but the suites are actually too big.  It’s easy to lose track of where you stuff is throughout the suite!  Everything is over-the-top gold and fancy.  The suite was two floors, and I could play my iPod in every room in the suite (including the closets and bathrooms!!). 

2. This is the only hotel I have ever seen that provides a laptop for you in the room.  

3. The butler service is very nice, and everything was done very quickly.  Also, most of the staff would acknowledge us by name as we walked around.  

4. We took a buggy over to the private Burj Al Arab beach.  It was very nice, and the view of the Burj is incredible from there. 

5. We had a couples massage.  It was very good, and the spa is beautiful. 

6. The indoor infinity pools that are part of the spa on the 18th floor are really, really neat.  Definitely check them out. 

7. All of the staff was excellent.  There was one guy that sat at the 11th floor reception during the day on August 10 that was less-than personable, and was mis-informed about some things, but other than him, everyone very, very nice, and genuinely seemed to care about their jobs. 

8. We ate at all of the restaurants while we were there.  Everything was very good.  Though, if you are going to order a bottle of wine watch out!  Because of the incredible taxes, an average bottle of wine was about US$300-400!","5","2011-08"
"Best Hotel in the World","I have travelled all over the world and the Burj Al Arab is without doubt the best hotel i have ever stayed at. Sure it's expensive but for what you receive it is absolutely worth it.
I have visited this hotel 4 times now and every time i have never wanted to leave.
The decor is completely ostentatious but i think that's part of the appeal as you will never ever see that anywhere else.
The rooms are all huge and the carpet is so thick and comfortable. 
The rooms are completely spotless and they even give you fresh flowers every day and a small gift on your bed every night.
The Beach is simply amazing. Clean white sand, crystal clear water just the perfect temperature and a waiter always on hand to get you a cold towel and drink.

Because the hotel is on it's own private island the pool area is quite small however this doesn't matter as the benefit of staying at a jumeirah group hotel means you can use the large pools at the jumeirah beach hotel and the madinat which are both only a buggy ride away.

If you have a special occasion and are thinking of blowing the bank i'd say blow it at the Burj. Perfection.","5","2011-06"
"Absolutely incredible!","We booked to stay here for the weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary using their honeymoon package.

Included were BMW transfers, cocktails on arrival, a bottle of red wine, a bottle of champagne, dinner at Al Muntaha,  couples spa treatment, a jacuzzi aromatherapy bath and breakfast.

From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable, the staff lovely and the suite beautiful.

I can't fault anything, this is the most opulent and over-indulgent place I have ever stayed and I would go back in a heartbeat (bank balance allowing!).","5","2011-08"
"Iconic Building","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab hotel and I have reviewed it under Dubai Hotels. If you are not staying and wish to visit, it is well worth the effort and far more interesting than it's taller friend the Burj Khalifa.
The hotel is on a man made island a couple of hundred metres offshore, and you need to have made a reservation in advance even to get into the building( so many people want to visit so they need to control the flow of people). We went to the Skyline Bar at the top of the building which seems to defy gravity by sticking out of the side of the building. The views are not that special but the food and drink is. It's not cheap but well worth the experience.","5",
"A 'must have' gaudy experience!","I stayed with my family at the burj for 3 days... Just for the experience. It is over the top in every way. Very luxurious, but not to everyones tastes - if you're a Rap star, a premiership footballer or a rich nigerian minister..you will love it. I loved it too, but in a ironic way. From the minute you arrive you are swarmed by so many members of staff, tipping becomes a very expensive excercise. The entrance lobby isn't that big but has an amazing dancing water feature that  cascades down from the high atrium. The check in is a breeze, I didn't even realise I had checked in. At the burj every room is a suite. You also have your own personal butler/valet who will unpack your luggage and do whatever else you require. There is also a kind of concierge/check out desk on every floor. The suite itself...wow! So gaudy, it's wonderful. The fixtures and fittings are of top quality but style/design and colour is in such bad taste that's it's fantastic! Gold every where, bright coloured luxurious carpets and soft furnishings with wonderfully jazzy prints. It's very spacious, with a huge living area, dining area and an office area on the ground floor. The bedrooms are on the foor above, and are more muted than the living area, much easier on the eye. The nbathrooms are large, all marbled up and have a jacuzzi. The toiletries are Hermes. All curtains are electric, there is a very good media system and there is wifi. There is nothing else you could require, all is provided. There a number of very restaurants and there is a sky bar at the top... all are very nice and all are very expensive ( did you really expect different? ). The service in this hotel is fantastic! I find the service in Dubai hotels is superior to any I've experienced in Europe Asia and USA. That may have something to do with the vulnerability of the migrants workers, but let's not get all political otherwise we'd be in danger of feeling slighty guilty. I find paying big tips to the staff helps to ease my conscience. When you stay the burj you get complimentary entry to Wild Wadi water park next door, so that was a welcome treat for the kids.. and the adults. In summary, you should experience this hotel at least once...maybe only once. 

PROs.  Good location. Fantastically gaudy. Well equipt rooms. Superb service. Great restaurants and food. An iconic property. 

CONs. Very expensive. Fantastically gaudy.   ","5","2011-03"
"Crazy - amazing experience!","Stayed here for 3 nights with my girlfriend and 3 kids. (2 years old and 6 month old twins) I believe this place more than met whatever expectations I had.

From the instant we entered the hotel, we were treated like royalty. Which is really really nice, considering it doesn't happen very often for us! Staff were polite and did their best to satisfy any need we could have possibly had. Our room was larger than expected, bed was amazing and the food and room service were prompt and great.

Everything about our stay was unforgettable and I'd definitely stay here again if the money's available.","5","2011-07"
"Wow! Cost nearly a month's wages for one night, but what an experience.","Many years ago we watched a documantary on the Burj, and I promised my daughter that we'd stay there one day.
When we spent 3 days in Dubai en-route to the Seychelles, we did stay there one day... and one day only! As I'm not rich, this is all I could afford.
However, I would recommend if you're ever passing through Dubai, spend a night at the Burj just for the heck of it.
The check-in receptionist comes to you, and you are offered hot towels and dates, after which they will take you up to your room and introduce you to your team of butlers on your floor... not that you get a floor, every suite has two floors! You are given a guided tour of your suite.
The butlers offered us a pillow menu so we could choose what type of pillows we had for our bed.
Our butler team changed while we were down at breakfast, yet we were still greeted by name as we got off the lift. I have no idea how they knew our names from all the other guests, but they did.
If you go for afternoon tea as we did, you won't need an evening meal. Afternoon tea started with champagne, and continued with a selection of teas, and course after course of lovely food.
The pool is great, the gym and spa is great. You are treated like royalty by all the staff who are fantastic.
Save up. Go there.","5","2010-09"
"Special Place","Add it to your bucket list. Worth the stay if you can justify the $$$$. Cant fault the staff, the service - as good as Ive stayed in and Ive stayed in most. The Phantom transfer from the airport is a must as is the heli flip from the roof.","5","2011-05"
"Amazing but something was missing","For a 1,180$ a night sleep, I didn't my find my sleep any better, nor did I wake up more refreshed then usual in the morning. I still woke up tired and cranky like I do at home, only at home it costs about 1,200$ less. I mean, sure the doors aren't as nice at home then they are here and there's no hotel staff at home, just a cat, although the bed was quite a comfier. I'd say it was well worth the 1,200 dollars to sleep in a comfy bed in a pretty room.","5","2011-05"
"Awesome","From the moment we were picked up at the airport in their own BMW and presented with flowers by the friendly and courteous driver we knew we were going back to our second home. Having stayed on a number of occasions you would think we would not have more to find out or do in this wonderful place--- wrong---. We had requested an early check in as took an overnight flight and after being met as usual at the entrance we were then escorted up to our panoramic suite to find the bed turned down and blinds closed so we could rest. Ask the butler to do your unpacking as this is one of the greatest perks of the hotel and boy worthwhile as one job I personally do not like doing. We stayed using their Summer Offer which included lunch or dinner each night and what a delight to try out. The staff are exceptional and too many to mention by name. Mr Morio should be proud of this hotel and his staff. Thank you ALL soooo much and will see you next month.","5","2011-05"
"Truly awesome","Superlatives are wasted when discussing the Burj Al  Arab. 

Just the building itself sees regular crowds of tourists taking photographs from behind the security gate. I would suggest no other hotel on the planet attracts this type of admiration.

From the minute you are driven across the bridge into the breathtaking interior you know you are in for something special.

Suffice to say the Burj does not disappoint in any way. The service, restaurants, rooms and all amenities are all second to none.

If you ever get the opportunity to stay here you should do as its boast as ‘the worlds most luxurious hotel’ is somewhat of an understatement.

The hotel is truly awesome.","5","2011-07"
"Didn't stay at hotel - but visited Junsui for Asian Afternoon Tea","I was in Dubai for a five days and I wanted to at least see the Burj al Arab whilst I was there. I emailed the Junsui to make a reservation at the restaurant, because I was told that you can only gain entry to the Burj by way of staying there or eating there. I thought I'd treat myself with lunch so at 250AED this wasn't cheap. Initially they told me they were full and offered me another day, which I had to decline because I wouldn't be in Dubai. The next thing I know I get another email confirming my booking - on the day I wanted and at the time I wanted. I was happy and very much looking forward to my visit.

On the day of the visit, I thought I'd make the most of the day because it was a distance from my hotel. I made my way to Jumeirah Beach in the morning - it was Monday so it was women and kids only. Entry was about 5AED if I remember correctly.

The beach was GREAT, I had a nice time, but it did get spoiled by a lady and her extremely loud friends who came and camped next to me. You can rent loungers but I just used my towel. The atmosphere was very relaxing and I could see the Burj al Arab in the distance. I thought I'd chill out, sunbathe until1pm then make my way to the Burj.

Upon arriving I was greeted by two female meeters and greeters. They were nice from the initial point, but once they thought I was out of earshot and not paying attention, they proceeded to whisper to each other - I highly suspect that they were talking about me.

I didn't let this put me off and so made my way towards the escalators, the décor was second to none, absolutely fabulous. 

I arrived at the Junsui and was shown to my table immediately. The service was excellent, and my waitress was very attentive. They even asked if I was there for a special occasion (birthday etc). I had around seven course, they were all great, except  for one - which I didn't eat - it was a beef with noodles in a very very strong soup. The strength of the soup put me off and I left it.

The other courses were nice and small, but as there are seven courses - you're not going to go hungry!

The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, although, for a restaurant that was supposed to be fully booked after the initially rejected my reservation enquiry - it was rather quite. They had a whole section with vacant tables.

The restaurant was nice and clean, as were the restrooms.

After finishing, I did explore the Burj - it was very pretty, I went up to the other restaurant to see the Palms, but it was hardly visible from that angle.

It was a nice experience and at that price, definitely a treat.

Although, I must say later that evening after dining here, I was not well after eating here - I think perhaps it was that soup from the beef and noodle. I did feed this back to the hotel only to be told that there was no evidence to prove this.

I'd still recommend the Burj to anybody just for the experience. The follow up to my feedback could have been handled better.","4","2011-04"
"BEWARE - NOT FOR FAMILIES","We had opted to stay in Burj Al Arab  during a recenut stay in Dubai - one of the suites at a total cost of some USD2k per night.  When we arrived we were greeted well by the floor reception who showed us the suite which was indeed impressive.  

We had decided to take a short break to celebrate the birthday of our 3-yr old son and wanted to do something special.  This hotel is NOT capable of handling YOUNG families and in particular CHILDREN.  Many of the restaurants were not accessible with children - fair enough - but even those that were accessible were not at all receptive to children with the staff being both discourteous and rude.  

The swimming area on the ground floor proved a similar experience with the bar (which is actually situated in the water in the pool) serving alcohol to swimmers.  A family hotel is not one where I would expect to see swimmers walking through the water carrying a pint of Fosters while my 5yr old daughter swims past them.  

Overall - a thoroughly disappointing experience.  

Sure - for couples and for business this would be a nice hotel.  BUT PLEASE - THOSE OF YOU WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 10 - DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND STAY AT ONE OF DUBAI'S OTHER TOP HOTELS - e.g. The Address where you can have easier access to Dubai Mall with a range of options.  BURJ AL ARAB IS A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.","1","2011-07"
"Amazing...as was expected","This hotel is an experience in and of itself.  It is true luxury by world-class standards.

I was greeted at the airport by a hotel limousine service, which brought me to the hotel.  

I was in a two-bedroom suite, which had far too much space for  just me: it came well-stocked with all kinds of drinks and candies as well as all the necessities one could need while travelling (toiletries, slivers, etc): there was a laptop provided as well as 24/7 butler service.  There is a “menu” of items that you can select related to your stay that I’ve never found in any other hotel, such as your selection of mattress.  They, of course, have a pillow menu as well – this is becoming more common amongst high-end hotels.  The linens and towels are all top-grade, as is the décor, not only in the common areas, but in the rooms as well.  No detail was spared, and no expense either, it would appear.

The Skyview restaurant is superb, with great food and views and impeccable service.  Bring a jacket, gentlemen – it is a requirement.  The underground seafood restaurant is also a very unique experience, and serves equally as delectable food with a much different kind of view.  

The pool is a great way to spend some time outside without frying in the intense Dubai sun, and staff go to great lengths to ensure your comfort.  

Overall, a great experience to feel pampered: I saw a couple of A-list Hollywood celebrities and a few famous faces I couldn't quite place, and felt utterly spoiled for my stay.  

Aside from the prohibitive cost, I would be back in a flash to feel opulence at its best.","5","2011-02"
"7 Star - I THINK SO!!!!","I had booked our first ever trip to Dubai for my husbands 30th birthday - it was all a surprise so I kept where we were going until the airport checkin, and he thought we were staying at 1 hotel, but I kept surprising him by moving hotels. This was our last night! We had moved from the address downtown, to the DAR and then on the morning of checkout (I had already emailed the Burj to request 12noon checkin) I asked our butler to confirm this was still ok, which he did. Hubby had been going on and on and on since our arrival in Dubai about please can we go to the Burj - I kept putting him of saying you cannot unless your a guest or eating there etc and it was too costly. Well by the third day sitting at the DAR staring at the BURJ - he was driving me mad - I lied and said I had booked lunch there for him! Shut him up! He kept taking pictures of it from the water at the DAR so I knew how excited he was. Well the driver from the DAR to the burj was great - properly dressed, white suit, hat etc. Great guy. Up the drive we go to the short trip from the DAR to the burj, our name was in the window so straight through security we go. Pull up to hotel and inside we are taken, drink offered, welcomed and shown to the lobby sofa.  2 mins later it must have been (went so quick as we were gawping at the fishtanks, the water fountains, the floor,, everything!!!, the lady comes up to us and says welcome to the Burj - let me show you to your room!  My husbands face looked soo funny - he looked at me - our room he asked?????? Yep I said - off up the escalater we go, towards the lift - with the lady pointing to the beautiful looking restaurants on way - and explaining times etc. The lifts  - I mean seriously - the lifts!!! Are amazing, never seen anything like them - must have cost sooooo much. I had looked at videos on google so knew roughly what to expect, but hubby was in awe, looking up towards the room levels and the roof of this massive building - how anyone can not be impressed fails me!

onto our floor and to our butlers - great helpful people - and taken into room - I found out later that the hubby thought that this was a checkin suite - as they explain the business area - offer you a drink etc. Then they walk you through the suite - we had a honeymoon special rate so got standard room (standard..... yeah right!) 2 floors, huge TV - lost count of sofas and chairs, tables! Intro done - me and hubby were left to explore - out of this world - he is straight on the phone to his brother giddily talking about where he is - the view from the huge panoramic windows! fantastic! We could see the Burj khalifi!!!!!!

As everyone has said huge bathroom, bed etc. Once in a lifetime truely!

We spent  afternoon sunbathing on loungers near pool - but on the grass away from the pool as there were quite a few kids in the little pool and we wanted to relax - looking out towards the palm and back to the DAR - ohhhhhhh gives me goosebumps even now!

We had lunch in our room as were starving - my pasta dish was not as ordered so rang them and they brought the correct one up - no problem. Lunch was surpurb - they set it all out on your table, with table cloth, cutlary, breads, drinks, heated servers etc - we wanted to spend as much time in the suite as we could so got value for money lol so it was great to spend that time on our own eating in our hugggggge room!

Later that night the head of in room dining - came up to our room - apologising for the error earlier that day - he asked where we were eating etc that night and I am sure he made special arrangements for us!

Part of our rate included aromatherapy bubblebath  with champagne - well I just found out i was pregnant before arriving in Dubai so knew I could not have either the bubble bath or the champagne - so they prepared it for my hubby and brought me a non alcoholic sparkling drink too - lovely touch!
As part of our rate we could eat at Al bahar I think it was or the beach side - after getting much advise from TA members before leaving I knew to go for the beach one if weather was OK - nightime weather was hot but OK for sitting outside, so we had the meal on the beach, on a rug, our own huge table, flame torches around us, a guitarist was playing at the main restaurant and kept popping over to our table by the waters edge - food was great - it was  a set reduced size menu, but when I explained I was pregnant and couldn't eat the raw beef starter, they prepared me the most delicious prawn lemon salad starter ever!!! My best meal! Had lamp chops as mains - they were huge! Couldn't finish dessert! They they brought out a cake for hubby! We could not face another cake but said thankyou and they packed it up for us to take back to the hotel.

When we got back to the room, the butlers also brought us another two cakes!!!!!!!! One for hubbys birthday and one for our anniversary! And another bottle on sparkling wine (non alcoholic). More flowers, cards! it was unbelievable it really was - we couldn't stop smiling and taking photos of everything!  

Hermes products etc are in room as everyone has said, must be hundreds of pounds worth!

Decided to have breakfast in our room - thank god - because we did not want to leave the huge comfy bed - like heaven - not sure about the large gold mirror above the bed on the ceiling......... hmmmmmm :)

use the remote to let the dining guy in, he sets it all up on our table downstairs and tells us when it is ready - down we go - well i have never seen an array like it - we got it included in our package but paid abit extra for the full breakfast (given an allowance towards it). There was breads, cakes, cereal, juices, hot food, fruit! Toast... endless. We were full!!!!  

That day we decided to spend time on the beach - we had done the pool area. So we went in the buggy to the beach - the people at the restaurant remembered us from the night before and greated us like friends - they got the beach guys to get us towels etc on whichever group of loungers we wanted - you don't have to worry about moving your lounger in and out of the shade here - oh no - you get around 4 loungers for 2 people - two in the sun and 2 under the shade!!!! They brought us a huge bucket filled with ice and water - and those lovely smelling face clothes! They kept refilling the bucket with fresh ice like every hour! Ahhhh it was the life! We didn't want to leave!

We worked out by having 3am flight home we could spend the whole day at the Burj - so paid for one night but really got 2 full days!. They arranged for a late checkout - 4pm - but they did not rush us - once settled bill (in your own room of course) they just told us not to rush - whenever we wanted tell them and they would arrange for our bags to be stored whilst we used to hotel facilities. We had a spa massage included as our package but hubby didn't want one - so instead they arranged for me to have a facial as well as my massage! We booked this for around 5pm as worked out we could use the spa area for pool for sunset, getting ready etc. Well the spa is lovely - the rooms look out to sea - the treatments were great - not sure how anyone can moan about the environment. The areas to get ready are like a spa in themselves! They show you around the hot tubs in the shower area, the full size shampoos, moistorisers etc in the changing areas - towels, slippers etc - the pool was fantastic but we did not get to use it - because my treatments lasted much longer than i thought - so by time they were done hubby was hungry and wanted dinner!

We ate in the restaurant near the pool - think that is the al bahar. Our butler had make our reservation. We sat outside having a cool drink first which was lovely - a wind storm had started and we sat there with this amazing wind - cool but hot - watching the sea turbulant, and the pool water flowing over the pool edges, the trees rustling - memory galore! Inside we went and greeted like regular guests - when we said we were leaving that night - they seemed shocked, why.... they asked - the beach guys did them same - more money we need I think!!!!

Food quality was great here, and service, starters, cooking station, lobster, desserts! I felt very poorly so could not eat much but hubby enjoyed everything! They asked us if celebrating anything special - about 4 times, we lied and said no as we honestly could not face another chocolate cake!!!!!!!!! Wondered around the grounds, saw a group of people having welcome drinks on the lawn as they then went to a ballroom in the hotel - this is the life i thought.

We were given more flowers and a leaving gift - huge glass photo frame with the burj on in a presentation box - now sits on our table with a photo of us on the beach at night with the lights of the burj billowing like its sail like appearance!

And off we went in our complimentary transfer to the airport around 10pm.  Yes it is expensive but it was worth every penny - we will never forget it and lifes too short.. For those who say it is not 7 star and the service was hit and miss - what hotel were you in???????? I am sure one comment on something not being tip top would have received an over the top solution! If we had the money we would go again - £1 a day we need to save we have worked out and we will be back!!! Go and enjoy - and remember it for every day thereafter!","5","2011-05"
"Best hotel in the world","Stayed here one night on my trip to Dubai with my friend. I had booked a one bedroom (1,800 sq ft) but when we got to the hotel they upgraded us to a two bedroom (3,600 sq ft)! The butler took us up to the room and explained how to use all the electronics then gave us a complete tour of the massive room (as big as some houses). There was juice, fruit and wine waiting for us in the room as well. The hotel is amazing, the room was huge and very nicely decorated in my opinion. They have everything you could want..... pillow menu, mattress selection if you need it, everything. The butler showed us how to get to the private beach and to the skybar. Both of which were awesome. We got free bags, slippers, bathroom products, etc. There was a laptop with internet access in the office area of the room. We didn't have jackets that are required to eat at the restaurants so we ordered in. We ordered a bunch of stuff and it arrived soon after. The waiter wheeled in the cart and setup everything on the dining table. Food was great and the service was amazing. Anything you needed, you just had to ask. Checking In and checking out were super easy with a desk on every floor. No problems with either. The pool on the 18th floor was awesome, great view! Loved every minute we spent there. The only thing I regret is not having enough money for the other nights we were in Dubai!!! All in all it's not a hotel most people can afford but if you can save up for a night here, DO IT! Well worth the experience. The Burj Al Arab and it's staff make you feel like a billionaire.","5","2011-03"
"Very impressive","We stayed for 3 nights in a panoramic suite and loved the experience. Although very expensive, we felt it was value for money due to the unique nature of the property. The suite was huge and provided amazing views across the city. We were very well treated - we arrived at 8am and they gave us a deluxe suite to freshen up in until our room was ready. This included all the full size Hermes products and snacks - so we experienced 2 rooms for the price of one!
Cocktails in the Sky Bar are wonderful and being able to skip the line as resident guests made it all the more fun. The service was exceptional on every level and we felt really special during our stay.
The only criticism I have is that we have since returned for dinner and cocktails and we found the food in Junsui to be very disappointing. We literally spat out the dim sum and the rest wasn't too much better. They appear to have spent all their money on amazing furnishings and had none left to pay for decent chefs.","5","2010-09"

"Amazing Experience","We had ten days in Dubai and my husband was really keen to have one night in the Burj Al Arab ( we were staying at The One & Only Royal Mirage) so we left the children for one night with our nanny and off we went.

I wasn't that fussed about going to be honest but my feelings rapidly changed upon arrival!!!

You are greeted personally when you pull up, whilst the lobby is without a doubt stunning I did feel it had the air of a conference centre about it because it is so huge.

We were taken straight to our room, we had received an upgrade to a panaromic suite and quite simply it was stunning. Yes it was decorated in an over the manner, bright colours and gold and it may not be our taste but you couldn't help but be impressed. The views were amazing, the Arabian Gulf to one side and the city to another. Our suite was so beautiful we spent the rest of the afternoon there just enjoying it!!

As previously mentioned you get full size Hermes toiletries which are wonderful, there were lots of little treats in our room, such as sweets and juices.

We had dinner that evening in the Skyview restaurant, it was outstanding from start to finish, from the wonderful food, the views and the service. It was amazing service but it didn't feel over the top they have got the balance just right. The food is delicious, one of the best meals we had in Dubai and the views are wow!!

The next day our children joined us and we had lunch in the underground seafood restaurant, I was a bit worried about taking them as they are only  2 & 5 but the staff were brilliant and my two were totally entranced by the live fish in the aquarium. The food was again fantastic and it was a wonderfully relaxed affair.

We left the hotel then and returned to the One & Only but decided to cut short our stay there and return to the Burj Al Arab for our last two days, this time we had a two bedroom suite and I've never seen so much space in a hotel room!!!! We had two dining rooms, two living rooms and a kitchen, it was amazing, we could have lived in it!

It's the little touches that make this hotel so special, the children had their own set of toiletries and little flip flops and sweet treats, my five year old's mouth was constantly open, he couldn't believe all this was just for us!

We had lunch by the pool whilst our two were in the baby pool, food and service also fantastic. We spent the day at the pool and whilst its not huge there's plenty of room, there is a nice cooling breeze which keeps it bearable, the pool is at a lovely temperature and there is a nice pool bar you can swim upto and get a drink. The staff come around during the day with slices of fruit, water & ice lollies.

We also took advantage of the entrance to Wild Wadi and that was amazing, we all had a great time!

We had breakfast in the room twice and it was outstanding, you even get your own toaster!

We had dinner in the beach side restaurant one night, the food was okay, nothing special.

It was a fantastic experience and I really enjoyed it, we left Dubai feeling relaxed and very pampered and after all that's what a holiday should be about, give it a go, you won't regret it.","5","2011-04"
"Huge Suite...Rip off for Breakfast....Abysmal Spa.....Amazing Service","Got Upgraded from a regular suite to a Royal Suite which was incredible. (The regular suite is not too shody either) USD 300 for breakfast for 2 adults and 3 kids......seriously. The hotel Spa was patrhetic. We asked some friends who live locally and they directed us to SensAsia Spa down the road. What an amazing place and cheap in comparrison to a hotel spa. Left us feeling like we had had a whole vacation in 3 hours. (cost us less then breakfast as well)","4","2011-06"
"3 stars maybe, but definitely not 7","The architecture is indeed colourful and striking but the rooms themselves are in need of an update. Style, amenities and technology (tv, remote controlled drapes, computer etc.) scream late 90's. More than a decade later, the rooms are just not that impressive. 

Service was spotty. Requests to the concierge on our floor went unanswered. We had two butlers working in shifts. The first one was silent and indifferent but the 2nd one was friendly, helpful and even made us dinner reservations at the seafood restaurant when the concierge failed us. This was a constant theme throughout the hotel with some staff being professional and gracious and others being unacceptably rude. This inconsistency made for a rather strange and uncomfortable stay.

Seafood restaurant itself had mediocre food that was too pricy. But it did have the wall to ceiling aquarium that is the reason people go to it in the first place and that ""submarine""  people take to get to it. The general effect was that the restaurant was a disney-esque tourist trap. 

Overall, everything was disappointing and did not live up to it's reputation. Definitely not the ridiculous 7 stars it proclaims itself to be.","2","2010-08"
"Definitely 7 Stars !","This hotels lives up to the stories . Over the top rooms and amazing staff . Hotels in the Jumeirah group are much better priced but the experience is worth it ..... and the bragging rights ! ","5","2011-07"
"Come on....this is perfection!","I don't know how anyone would rate this hotel anything but 5 stars....seriously.    I have stayed in some of the top hotels all over the world and this one is, hands down, the absolute best.   The rooms are amazing.....cozy, comfortable, large, best in class views, fresh fruit, complimentary drinks, fresh flowers, coffee/tea, cookies, Arabic snacks, a business center, a living room and dining room - and that is just the first floor.   The bedroom is amazing and the bathroom is to die for.

The service is beyond great.......they attend to your every need.   And...it is not fake.   They seem genuine and eager to please all the guests.   

The restaurants are very good!   Get the half board if you can find it in the rate as this will save you tons of cash.   The pool area is also very nice and also very relaxing.

There is not much more I can say about this place other than it is an experience of a lifetime.   Book it now.......we all loved it.","5","2011-06"
"Not sure at first, but very glad I gave it a try! Will come back!","I was not sure whether to go here at first, but thought I'd give it a try just to experience it once. I do not regret my decision one bit and look forward to coming back! Simply amazing!

At first, I was fearing garish, over-the-top design just for the sake of being expensive, but I must say I was pleasantly suprised. All the opulence somehow works, from the huge entrance atrium to the fountains, aquariums and gold plus bright colours of the rooms. De gustibus non est disputandum, but what can be said about the rooms is that they do have everything you can think of to make your stay enjoyable.
The work desk has a laptop already there, the bathroom has a jacuzzi, the fruit basket is full, there is a box of sweets on the table, the minibars are well stocked with water and softdrinks, you have a bottle of complimentary wine waiting (don't feel like red? the butler will happily replace it with a white), there is a Nespresso machine with a choice of caps, the bathroom is full of Hermes soaps, shower gels, shavers and everything you need. You could probably stay there without bringing any toiletries of your own!

The bed is very comfortable (I slept like a stone :)) with a choice of pillows from your butler. The carpets are soft and deep, the huge panoramic windows can be darkened well, temperature regulation works despite the sun and all the glass. Everything from the door to the TV is controlled via remote, so if someone rings the doorbell, the TV pops up so you can see who it is and let them in by pressing a button on the phone, TV remote or universal remote.

The gym is well equipped with the newest Technogym machines (automatic weight control), PowerPlate, large number of dumbbells etc. The view from up there is pretty impressive too. The staff was friendly and helpful as everywhere else in the hotel.

The pool is pretty and the water cool, which is a blessing, as the sea can be quite warm. But it's quite small, with a poolbar in it too. The deckchairs look out to see and as usual, staff is immediately on hand to give you towels.

We didn't try the spa.

The service is impeccable. We got checked at the security gate before the bridge and by the time we were at the entrance, the butlers had our name memorized. We were nearly always greeted by name, which is quite a feat with my complicated Swiss-German last name. The only time I felt the service was a bit too much, was at breakfast. We got asked if everything was fine by about 5 different staff. It would be better if one person was responsible for a table and they would check on you, rather than just anyone passing by asking you if you need anything.
I also felt that people actually knew what they were talking about when asked something.

You do notice that there are a lot of non-resident tourists wanting to see the building, taking pictures by the fountain etc. When you go up to the bar as a young couple, it is assumed you're just here for a drink and to have a look around. Reservations? Ah, you're hotel guests? Entirely a different matter, let me show you around, right this way, sir!

Everything is quite expensive (rooms, spa and restaurants), compared even to other top luxury hotels. But it's well worth the experience. It must also be said that a lot is included in the room price, which adds up (complimentary wine, Hermes shower stuff, snacks, a beach bag, Wild Wadi Water Park entry, golf cart rides to Jumeirah, Madinat, the hotel beach or Wild Wadi etc.), if you enjoy the little freebies.

In summary, not something I'd do every holiday, but well worth the experience or to have a pampering time-out with your better half.","5","2011-06"
"Opulence...  I has it.","f Dubai is known for having that which is the largest/tallest/most-(insert adjective here), then Burj Al Arab takes the cake as the most extravagant, unequivocally deserving of its moniker as “the world’s most luxurious hotel”.

Situated on its own artificial island, the hotel, which is designed to resemble the sail of a dhow, boasts luxurious 2-story suites fitted with every imaginable amenity. Each room is equipped with its own business center, complete with laptop, printer and fax, and a beverage center including a single-serve coffee machine and complimentary non-alcoholic beverages. The panoramic views are astounding, as are the ornately decorated interiors (and while contemporary minimalism is typically more our style, the bold colors and lavish fabrics work beautifully together here).

As other reviewers here have already detailed the many perks of this establishment, I’ll simply sum up what has been most memorable:

-       butler service

-       pillow menu

-       daily snacks/free bottle of wine/box of sweets

-       full sized Hermes shampoo/soaps/perfume/cologne

-       nice and quiet private beach

-       complimentary access to Wild Wadi Waterpark

-       amazing views

-       exemplary service

We only tried one of the hotel’s restaurants – Al Mahara – during our stay. While the large aquarium was wonderful to see, the food was average and pricey (as to be expected). Skip it, and check out the huge aquarium at the Dubai Mall instead.

The bottom line is that staying at the Burj Al Arab is, for most, an indulgent splurge. That said, the experience was, for us, worth every penny.","5","2011-05"
"Fantastic Hotel!","A long promised family trip with myself, husband and 2 teens aged 15 and 17,

We flew Etihad and stayed for the first part of our trip at the Jebel Ali.  We transferred by Jebel Ali taxi about 11 am.

We arrived at the security entrance by the Wild Wadi to find many people having their pictures taken with the Burj as a backdrop.

The security guard questioned the driver, took our reservation number and name and checked it off. We were in!! Alcatraz has nothing on the Burj security guards!

We drove across the bridge, our suitcases were unloaded and we went inside. At the same time that we arrived, so did alot of other guests with other various reservations (maybe brunch?). We were rescued by a lovely lady who took us to sit down. We were offered cold towels, dates etc and she took away our passports noting the teens birthdays were coming up. She returned straight away and apologised but our suite wouldn't be ready for another 10 minutes( on no!!). She took us up to the lobby lounge where we were invited to choose any drinks we liked from the menu while we waited. Lemon mint cocktails, cappuccinos, mocaccinos and hot chocolates later our suite was ready.

I was quite happy sitting in the lobby, looking at the aquarium, admiring the height of the atrium and marvelling at the amount of gold used that when our loveley lady returned we asked her to leave us for ten minutes more. When she arrived back she apologised for keeping us waiting!

Up in the lift to the 19th floor, suite 1905 a 2 bedroomed suite. It is true that you open the door, throw your bags down, race to the window for the view and then can't wait for every one to leave so you can explore and marvel at your surroundings. Our butler Hem was a dream. Nothing too much trouble. The entrance foyer houses your 'office' area with laptop, printer/ scanner, tea nespresso machine and bar area. The first of our 3 mini bars were here. We were asked what we would like it stocked with, You can choose from water, fresh juices, sodas etc or any combination. 

To the right the first lounge with a great sea view, fruit and chocolates. Turn right to the second lounge, dining area with more fruit and chocolates and right again to the full kitchen with butlers entrance.

Back to the stairs and downstairs cloakroom then it's up the spirals to the landing. Turn left to the twin bedroom and second bathroom and turn right to the master suite, bedroom, bathroom and dressing room.

Yes it's true everything is gold, opulent and plush. To be honest I doubt anyone on here has their living room decorated in that style but for the hotel it works. The bathrooms with their timed jaccuzzi are fabulous. The Hermes toilietries are gorgeous. The little touches make everything worth it.

The staff are so friendly, nothing too much trouble without being fawning. We did however try on many occasions to beat the butler from the lift to our front door because my youngest wanted to try the keycard. It was never to be as the butler would actually sprint to get there before you.

Everything is controlled by a portable electronic tablet - teen heaven in other words. 

Once settled we took the buggy over the bridge to the beach. I have seen the burj beach / restaurant entrance many times but never actually knew what it was. Into the airconditioned entrance, over the sand to the white umbrellas and 4 loungers were ours with constantly replenished iced water and lavender spray. The good thing about this stretch of beach is that it's not a great hike from sunbed to sea like the JBH. Settled in and spent a lovely, peaceful afternoon just bobbing in the sea with the teens off at the Wild Wadi. Nice lunch menu - expensive but not bank breaking.

Back off to get ready for dinner with a chilled bottle of wine and a tiramisu waiting for us. We had dinner in Al Iwan as I love Arabic food. The food was wonderful as were the staff. The teens were both presented with birthday cards. We were addressed by names, even the teens. The waiter would make suggestions and then go off and bring extras back. 

Back up to the suite for the teens to watch a movie and me to visit the skyview bar and the doorbell rings. In comes the butler with 2 bouquets of flowers, 2 birthday cards and the most enormous white chocolate, marshmallow and fruit birthday cake. Actually there were 7 butlers, the last one had a guitar and you know what happened next!

The teens recovered whilst husband and I visited the skyview bar for a nightcap. The burj Khalifa was all lit up and all was right with the world.

Set the alarm for early the next morning so as not to miss a minute. Went to breakfast at Bab Al Yam. Good quality and tried to cater for all tastes. Went to look around the pool. Nice but small. There was quite a breeze blowing and visibility was poor. A sandstorm we were told, all over the UAE.

I went to the beach and husband went off to the spa for a massage. Nice and relaxing but not the best he has visited. Everone else went back to the wild wadi and I was left in peace.

Spent the day on the beach. Left about 4 to get showered and changed then got the buggy over to the madinat for a wander round and dinner. Backto the burj about 9 and spent til 10 in the library with the men playing snooker. Our car was booked for ten to take us back to Abu Dhabi for the flight home.

We left with a heavy heart. I have visited some of the best hotels in the world and the burj surpasses them. Not for it's opulence, but for it staff and service with a smile attitude. Was one night enough? No but I will be back and it will be for longer.","5","2011-06"
"the epitome of luxury!","what do i say about this? dunno where to begin or end..its one of the finest experiences ive ever had! mos comfortable, best asthetics, amazing colour combine..luxurous, great attention to detail in every aspect.. very rich, very classy, pretty much every aspect s top noch! must visit the rooftop bar, its an experience of a lifetime! the view is out of this world!","5","2010-08"
"Another magical stay","Another wonderful stay at BAA.

We were collected from the airport in a pristine BMW. Complete with friendly uniformed and hat wearing chauffeur who offered us cold towels and water and gave me a boutique of roses.  On arriving at the hotel, we were whisked straight up to our panoramic suite on the 11th floor.

As usual the suite was immaculate with vases of roses and orchids everywhere.  Check-in took place swiftly and quietly in the suite while I was entertained with another boutique of roses, juice and an attempt to give me a tour around the suite.

The technology remains the same in the suite with a touch screen remote to control everything, although there is now an ipod sound system, which unfortunately is not integrated into the suite’s sound system.

The suite opened to a sweeping staircase, and mini business centre complete with laptop, printer and stationary.  But it’s the floor to ceiling windows that grabs you the most.  Palm-side is definitely the best view as its not blocked by Jumeirah Beach Hotel.  In a way it’s a shame that the lounge area doesn’t benefit from these windows but it is stunning in its own right with a chaise long, big comfy sofa, big tv and bar with complimentary soft drinks.  There is also a big WC hidden away with Hermes soap.

Up the beautiful stair case you enter the bed room with a massive comfy bed (bigger than super king size), and the best pillows I have ever come across, a separate dressing area and big bathroom with his and her sinks, full size shower and full size spa bath.  The bath room was also well equipped with Hermes products, tooth brushes, shaving stuff etc.

The hotel is as stunning as ever but is starting to show its age, particularly down by the pool.  The pool bar was looking particularly drab.  Also they have introduced new sun-loungers which now makes it feel like a normal resort but worse still are not as comfortable as the old ones.  That said the service remains second to none.

And that can be said all across the hotel.  You are made to feel like staff really care and take an interest.  I still have no idea how staff seem to know our name, even if we’d never met them before and it was nice of those that did remember us to come a say hello.

The food is still excellent.  I must thank the staff at Majlis Al Bahr who put on a fantastic bbq for us to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Our guests were so impressed with all the food, especially the lobster and lamb, all the salads and desserts.  The guitar playing/singing man was also a nice touch.

I could go on and on about how amazing the Burj is to look at but it’s the service that we go back for and the magic little touches that no one else seems to think of – all manner of staff wishing us a happy anniversary on the day and giving us cards and cakes (we even got a card from Junsui the night before our anniversary as we happened to be dinning there), water and lollies on the beach and by the pool, carrying a bag, remembering that we prefer skimmed milk instead of whole milk, providing canapés every night, ensuring that you always have calm and tranquillity in the hotel even when its heaving with tourists and they never ever rush you but are very prompt if you ask them to do something.  The best bit is that they are always smiling and gracious.  No airs or graces as you might imagine a hotel of this stature, always relaxed and nothing is too much trouble.

I can’t speak highly enough of the staff at the Burj and highly recommend a stay.  I can’t wait to go back!","5","2011-05"
"FANTASTIC","Any reviewer who says anything other than this hotel is fantastic is either on drugs, one of the fussiest examples of human kind on this earth and can never be pleased.  Basically you would only say it is not if you are trying to get something for free of which some people in this world are serial complainests like some people who have replied about this hotel.  Everything about this hotel is the finest it can possibly be.  Rooms are huge, everything is perfectly arranged, the place is as secure as you could possibly hope for, staff are so good they'd just about take a bullet for you they are so for you.  Seriously nobody who is not stoned could possibly not rank this 10 out of 10 for everything other than maybe value as it is one of the most expensive hotels in the world, but is also by far the best hotel in the world.  I work as a travel agent so am very critical where it can be, but it is just not possible.","5","2011-05"
"If It Looks Like Gold It Is gold","We went here as part of a day tour or Dubai organised thru Arabian Adventures for high tea and totally stunned by what we saw , It is a good idea to go there as part of this tour other wise you will not be permited entry as the security here is amazingly tight even though you cant get any further than the foyer and the mezzanine level where you have your high tea these areas just take your breath away from the gold doors and fittings to the fountains and shear oppulance of the place  it really does have that 7 star rating WOW , the high tea was fantastic and i,m glad that i took the tour guides advice and not have anything to eat before at all before as the 7 courses that you get will more than fill you up , some even have edible gold on them and the service from the staff just can,t be faulted even down to going to the gents or the ladies there is some one in there to turn on the water for you apply the pump soap on to your hands and give you a towel to dry them with and even give you splash of colonge if you so desire ( now I know how the other half live )
A trip well worth the effort and a place that my wife was dying to see  , do yourself a favour and take a look at this while doing the high tea it will just blow your mind to what can be done in Dubai .

"nothing else quite like it","my husband took me to the Burj to propose. We stayed for one night and were upgraded to a Panoramic suite, which is by far the biggest room I have ever stayed in and I think is larger than our large four bedroom flat! But at nearly £1k per night, it should be!!

The place is very over the top in decor and in service, but that is what is great about it. You don't check in, you have a seat and they bring everything to you, then you are escorted upstairs, your luggage is delivered and your butler shows you round your room. The Hermes products in the room alone cost well over £100 and they leave a Steiff teddy on your bed at night!

The pool was cold when we were there, which was very surprising as the sea was like a warm bath! Again, you don't lift a finger at the pool. I went to turn out a towel on a lounger and a pool attendant raced over at warp speed to stop me and then brought over bottles of water, misters and ice.

You also get free access to the waterpark at the Jumeira Beach resort and can use the beach there too. Waterpark was ok, but glad I didn't have to pay for access.

We did the Culinary flight meal with wine at c AED1500 p/p. Very expensive, but lovely. At each restaurant the restaurant manager took us to the next restaurant and the food was fabulous, but there was far too much food. At the end you are given a goodie bag with a book about the hotel, sweets etc.","5","2010-09"

its a hotel stay to die for","5","2011-04"
"Over the top while not meeting expectations","I'm writing this review from my ""single"" (as they call it) suite at the Burj Al Arab.
Yes it is true it is huge, 170 sq meters, bigger than my own home! Yes it is impressive but no no no and no, it is NOT tastefully decorated. Have you ever seen the furniture sold on the 3rd floor at Harrods? That's it - gold gold gold mixed with a number of colours. Well, not minimalist, not ""design"" and not something I would imagine in anyone's (not to mention mine!) home.
Anyway it is impressive and the view is absolutely fantastic.
Good in room entertainment system although it did freeze a few times.

Yesterday evening we went to the Al Muntaha (restaurant with the aquarium). Our butler informed us that the restaurant would give a jacket to my husband (because no, he didn't take his business suit on holiday!). Ridiculous. In the end they didn't because they realised that we were quite annoyed.
The prices at the restaurant..............we go to a lot of very good restaurants, and there is no problem with paying a lot for a very good (michelin starred) meal. But........there, it is just too much again. 90 pounds a main course! For an average quality. 75 pounds a bottle of italian rose! The desert (mago brulee) was way below average.
Of course the whole menu is in English and..........................Russian. As if they could not read English (I'm French by the way and I don't request that the menu be in French). So you see where the guest are from).

As for the service generally, too much (they insist on opening your door for you - that's find, I can hold a card for 2 seconds, I won't get tired) but not enough (we waited for 2 hours for a list of DVDs, we asked for a late check out yesterday and had to chase this morning to know).
I think (but this is to be verified) that they don't really care about the ""poors"" who can only afford (shame on me!) a ""single"" suite.

Good breakfast although nothing exceptional. After 4 nights at the Shangri La al Bandar in Oman, which was just amazing (flawless) for 1/4 of the price of the Burj al Arab, I kind of think that I should have done something else with my money!
But hey, at least we've ticked the box.","3","2011-05"
"Phenomenal","One of the most opulent, stunning, comfortable and well appointed hotels in the world.  The rooms are beyond spacious, the staff incredibly well trained and friendly and the hotel food (while expensive) is amazing (try the Wagyu beef burger).  

Its impossible to describe the scale of grandeur that this hotel achieves.  It truly needs to be experienced.  While by no means inexpensive, for a few nights splurge it is well worth the experience.","5","2010-06"
"Fabulous","Please go and even stay one night in this hotel as you will never ever regret the special experience. From the minute you enter this fantastic building you will never want to leave as you are treated like royalty. We have stayed on a number of occasions and simply cannot find another hotel to match this one. The suites are stunning and you won't want to leave but there is so much to discover within the hotel itself like a library which we used on one night before we headed home on a late flight and was so relaxing. The spa is out of this world and the view to die for as you have your massage but worth every penny.
My own personal part of the hotel is the pool area and the restaurant Bab al Yam where you can enjoy a breakfast fit for a king and the choice is amazing. Tag and his staff are so kind and always remember us by name and always make us feel special. Thank you to all who make this such an experience and we will be back very soon.","5","2010-11"
"Burj al Arab right now!","My family and I are staying at the Burj al Arab right now and I am posting this review from the hotel room! We arrived last Friday morning, 9am, so I emailed ahead to request an early check in. Nothing seems to be too much trouble.....Rolls Royce met us at the airport, a very warm welcome as we entered the hotel lobby, and the room was ready and waiting!
Our room, 1212, is a panoramic suite on the 12th floor. This room is superb, fantastic views, and the service from our butler Victor is second to none!
I will post a full review when home, but just had to praise where praise is due....this hotel really is 7 star in every way!!","5","2011-05"
"The first time i've ever been Speechless","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab for three nights to celebrate my husbands 40th Birthday.  The break was a surprise for my husband but it turned out to be a surprise for both of us.  We are seasoned travellers and often stay in some of the worlds most renowned and luxurious hotels including Sandy Lane, Barbados,  Raffles Hotels,  The One and Only's etc.....  but none of those even come close to this hotel.

We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived,  we were made to feel very special,  welcomed and they embraced us as though we were part of the family.  We arrived at 10am in the morning,  check in is usually at 3pm but we were not left waiting,  we were shown straight to our room on the 5th floor for the check in.  The bags arrived shortly after and once we were shown the amenities by our personal butler we were then left to explore this two storied one bedroom suite.  Our room overlooked the view towards Atlantis and palm island and the floor to ceiling windows were amazing.  Everything was computerised such as the lights,  curtains,  doors,  tv and on demand movies etc...  you had a handheld touch screen device that you can take around the room with you.

The first thing that amazed us as we came into the room was the sheer size of it and all the gold gilt and bright colours that decorate the room.  The grand staircase leading to the bedrooms was also a very big surprise but very beautiful.  

Before coming to stay at the Burj we had been here once before for afternoon tea a number of years ago and we thought it was very over the top and perhaps you wouldn't feel very relaxed staying there.  Now having stayed there we know that although it is over the top it is something that should be done at least once in your lifetime and it does seem very fitting for this hotel and we couldn't fault one thing,  we even managed to relax as well as the dress code is not strict for residents and we were able to come and go in our beach clothes without being made to feel uncomfortable.  

The staff were amazing  they anticipated our every need,  they knew us by name even if they'd never seen us before and no request was too much trouble.  They always greeted us with smiles.  The hotel had been informed by our travel agent that it was my husbands birthday and one evening we got a knock on our room door,  as we opened it we were confronted with three butlers wheeling a tray of desserts, a birthday cake and a guitar.  They then began to play and sing happy birthday and gave flowers, cards and a cake a wonderful surprise and a very memorable moment.  Thanks to all our butlers,  you were wonderful.

I used the gym a number of times while I was there.  They have a separate gym for women or a mixed gym if you prefer.  Both are equipped identical with all the latest machines and equipment.  The gym is on one of the top floors so the view is amazing while you're running on the treadmills,  the staff were also very helpful.

We visited the Wild Wadi waterpark for a day and reclaimed our youth.  I don't think it matters how old you feel you are this waterpark is a great way of enjoying yourself and not worrying that you may still act like a teenager.  All the rides were well thought out, the queues were small and the rides are well kept.  It was well worth the visit.  We also took the Segway ride for an hour and this too was well worth it.  We had a great time touring the Jumeriah resort.  The segways were very easy to control and with a few minutes practice we were off on the tour.  We thought they were very reasonably priced too.

We had a spa treatment which was also well worth it.  The hot rocks couples massage was lovely and we both felt very pampered and well looked after.

The only one thing that was a little inconvenient about this hotel was the access to the beach and although we didn't go to the beach during our stay at The Burj we can see that it would be difficult to know exactly where to go and how to get to it.  Saying that though there is so some much to do that for us the beach was last on our list of priorities.

Thank you for a wonderful stay and a great surprise.","5","2011-04"
"Very pampering, almost to a fault","Well, what can you say about the Burj? Certainly it's an icon for Dubai, a tourist attraction, and sets a very high standard of service. It's a hotel that we were curious about, and are now glad that we tried. But, it wasn't as relaxing an experience as I thought it would be.

After being at a very soothing desert resort in Abu Dhabi, we drove into Dubai and the Burj al Arab, which is on an island about 900 feet off the mainland. Prior to crossing the bridge to this looming, sail-shaped hotel, our car was stopped by security, which verified our booking before allowing us to pass. The hotel is so famous that it is a tourist attraction in its own right, and the lobby would be mobbed if there wasn't some restriction on entry. However, those who are not lodging there can still get inside by booking at the bar or restaurant, and they seem to take full advantage of the opportunity by posing for snapshots by the ground-floor fountain, but -- that's all right -- we did also.

The staff quickly unloaded the car, and I asked that it be left nearby because I would shortly come back down to return it at the airport. As it turned out, just settling into our room took much longer than anticipated, with the welcoming drinks, waiting for our luggage, and exploring the room, so the valets did move our car to the garage.

Disembarking from our car, we were ushered into the lower lobby; security had already informed reception of our arrival and the paperwork was ready for us. We sat for a moment, sipping a drink, as our information was verified. We were then escorted up an escalator, then in an elevator from the upper lobby to the 12th floor.

Each elevator stop actually represents two floors, because each suite is two levels. Thus, our room was actually 25-26 floors up, halfway up an atrium that rises from the upper lobby. Upon alighting from the elevator, we approached a desk manned by two butlers entrusted with the care of the guests on the floor. One of our new friends took over from the reception agent and escorted us to our two-bedroom suite. Upon opening the door, we entered a two-floor foyer with a curving staircase and an adjoining powder room. The first impression is one of size and detailed architectural features, with lots of gilding.

The butler began to explain the room features, which included hidden cabinets filled with glassware and minibar items, the provided cmputer and printer, and the electrical controls based around a touchscreen remote. Had he not shown me some of the hidden panels, I never would have tried pushing on them and would have thought it strange that the room had no glassware. I did decline the controls explanation, because we already have automated homes, and the operation was intuitive -- we could operate televisions, audio speakers in different rooms, draperies, the front door, and lights from the portable remote or wall switches.

We decided to explore our suite ourselves rather than take the guided tour (there were probably some secret panels elsewhere that we never found). On the lower level, the foyer opened into a small area with a desk and the computer. After that, there was a wet bar with the push-panel cupboards, and the expansive living room. It had a large wall-mounted flat-screen TV and comfortable lounging furniture. Boxes of candy, nuts, and dates sat on the coffee table alongside a selection of magazines. There was also a small game table and chairs.

Off the living room, through an archway, was a large room, largely open with only some scattered seating around the edges. It was obviously intended for entertaining, as it would hold at least 30-40 people for a cocktail party. It made us want to have such an event, but we realized that most of our friends were thousands of miles away. Adjoining the party room, separated by round white columns, was the dining room, with a large formal table and seating for six. The dining room had a storage closet, with extra chairs and a catering kitchen with sink, microwave, rangetop, full-sized refrigerator, and many (mostly empty) cabinets.

During our stay, we decided to have room service. Our butler came in to help us with the menu, and said our meal would arrive within about 30 minutes. We had sat down in the living room to await our dinner and enjoy a drink when the phone rang, and the butler announced, ""your dinner is served"". I explained that we were ready to open the door (using our handheld remote), but he informed me, ""sir, it has already been laid out on your table"". We walked through the party room and into the dining room, and, yes, one end of the table was full of our evening repast. Unknown to us, the staff had come through a door in the kitchen (another one of those secret panels, I guess) and set out our order without us even knowing they were there. Good service, but a little unnerving.

Anyway, back to the tour: upstairs, there were two bedrooms. The larger was about 20 by 30 feet, with a king-sized bed, mirrors on the ceiling, and various furniture, including a cabinet with a TV lift. A single button-push on the remote control would close the drapes and raise the flat-panel screen into viewing position. Off the bedroom was a back hallway with the bath and a separate dressing room, with a dressing table surrounded by wood-paneled closet doors leading to enough storage to house a large wardrobe. There was a back door in this room, intended for emergency use.

The master bath had a double sink, toilet and bidet, spa tub under a hand-painted mural, and a shower with wall jets. A nice touch was the full-size Hermes his & hers toiletries; we later saw them in a duty-free shop at Heathrow, priced at over $160 for the set. Of course, the plumbing fittings were elaborate and gold-plated.

Through the upstairs hallway ,across from the first bedroom, was a second, almost as elaborate, guest bedroom and a very similar bahroom. We joked about alternating nights in the two bedrooms, but the guest room remained unused during our stay.

The size and excesses of our suite caused some uneasiness. One night, I awoke and remembered that I needed to charge my iPad. After the usual ""where am I"" thoughts, I arose, walked across the huge bedroom, opened the double doors, entered the dark upstairs hallway, went down the stairs into the foyer and to the study desk, where the device was in my briefcase. That trip highlighted the feeling of much empty space, and that metric was underscored when a taxi driver, who obviously was arriving at the hotel for the first time, enquired about how big our room was and how much it was a night. I evaded the question, but we had ""gilt guilt"" after he told us where he lived and how much he earned in a month (which, we realized, was less than one night's tariff for our room).

The suite had over 4000 square feet, 14 closets, 21 phones, 4 large-screen televisions, 4 refrigerators, and 3 safes. A little much for just the two of us. At one point, my wife couldn't find me because I was in the kitchen getting a drink.

The size of the suite did make it more difficult to relax than in cozier quarters. I like a comfortable room, and having convenience  features, but all the space was actualy somewhat counter-productive to chilling out. Add in that the butlers were constantly calling to ask if we wanted complimentary food or drink, turndown service, or reminding us that our spa appointment was in 30 minutes, it was difficult to just feel at home.

Now, there was a button on the remote for ""do not disturb"", and I did find that it helped our privacy when I used it. And, if we had been staying there for months rather than days, we would have moved into the available space more completely, and probably become more accustomed to the routine. So, I would probably stay at the Burj again if I was there for an extended period, with family, and it was on expense account.

A few other features to mention. The hotel contracts with certain taxis that use nicer vehicles (Lexus, Mercedes). Just by asking, we were able to have a nicer ride from the hotel than in the taxis we found on the streets for our return to the hotel. The rates for the hotel-sponsored taxis were very similar to the standard rates.

When checking in, our passports were scanned. Our photos were put into the system, so that everywhere we went in the hotel, we saw ourselves on desktop monitors. Also, the butler insisted on always accompanying us to places like the spa and breakfast, to introduce and hand us off to us to the next staff. member. Of course, between the photos and the intros, we were usually greeted by name, and there was no question of how to bill any charges, it just happened.

The hotel's beach isn't very convenient. On our last day, we had some time before our late afternoon flight to London, so we decided to try out the nearby waterpark and take a dip in the Gulf. Our butler arranged the trip over in a golf cart, and we enjoyed the rides, especially the lazy river, where our slow, circuitous cruising eventually turned into friendly tubing races with local teen-agers.

Tiring of competition, we retreated to the uncrowded beach, but found that the portion reserved for the Burj guest was deserted, so we were directed over to the part for the Jumeriah Beach Hotel, which is a sister property to the Burj. When we were ready to go back, we couldn't find anyone that knew how to call for our golf cart, so we decided to just walk. Dressed in wet bathing attire, we finally found the back door to the hotel and avoided having to pass through the lobby. It seemed that the hotel was designed more for guests who want to use the spa pool rather than the beach and water park set.

Finally, a story about our first evening.  We wanted to try the Al Muntaha Restaurant atop the hotel after we returned from a short driving tour of the city and returning our hired car. Before we left the hotel, we were told that the earliest our butler could confirm the restaurant would be 9 p.m. We agreed, and made a special effort to be back on time, even taking the metro most of the way ( a taxi was still needed at the end) because it was faster than by car. Back at the hotel, I went up to the restaurant to secure our table while my wife freshened up back in the room. Unfortunately, we were told that our reservation had been delayed by 90 minutes. When I arrived back downstairs, the butlers asked why I was back, and seemed quite perturbed that the booking was not honored. In the end, we just had a drink in the room, and were given a special table in a quiet corner right by the window as our compensation for the confusion. The view was spectacular and the meal was very good, but probably not quite up to our anticipation, as this hotel does raise one's expectations (and mostly meets them).

In all, we were both happy that we tried the Burj al Arab, and it was an interesting experience. When we return to Dubai, we would probably try a different hotel unless we were staying for an extended time or wanted to entertain in our suite. Friends have described very nice rooms and suites that were available for one-sixth of our rate at this hotel. But then it wouldn't be the Burj, would it?","5","2010-12"
"simply the best","I had  a very comfortable stay here. It was an exhalarating experience,,,unforgettable. the hotel room service was upto the mark. and food was really amazing and delicious, also was amazed by the hospitality and warmth by the hotel staff and the adjacent water park (wild wadi) was more than amazing..with lots of slides and free falls water slides with excluzive and dedicated access for burj al arab guests :)","5","2010-04"
"Once in a lifetime experience","For me Dubai was not on the way to anywhere, but I wanted to stay at the famed Burj al Arab hotel. It claims to be the worlds only seven star hotel and I have to agree. It was a fantastic experience. They pick you up in a white Rolls Royce from the airport. The hotel it self is in the Arabian gulf, about a quarter mile offshore, and visitors and tourist are not allowed into the hotel grounds without a reservation. That is good as otherwise it would be like Disneyland. The room price is very expensive, I paid $2700 per night, but it was worth it. My ""room"" was a 3000 square foot, two stories, two bedroom suite with office, den, living room, formal dinning room, butlers pantry, two huge bedrooms, three bathrooms and two dressing rooms. Just enought room for my wife and I. :) They take you from the car directly to your room, and do the check in formalities in the office in your room. The decor can only be discribed as opulant or Arabian nights modern. The service was impecable and friendly. The glass elevator is an E ticket ride, and the spa and pool on the 40th floor is beyond belief. You may do this only once in your lifetime, but do it. It's worth it.","5","2010-04"
"Speechless, Truly the World's Most Luxurious Hotel","This hotel has it all! Great food, service, and amenities. After staying here for an entire week, we were able to use all the great facilities at the Burj Al Arab. From the breathtaking views from  our 'suite' to the butler services; everything was out of this world. Everyone gave us personal attention whenever they saw us throughout the hotel. We also loved how their was a reception desk on every floor which you can contact at anytime. I also enjoyed the Rolls Royce Airport Transfer! After having the opportunity to stay here and enjoy this architectural marvel of Dubai; I believe that this hotel truly deserves its  ""7 stars""! The only minor complaint I had during our stay was that their were too many outside visitors in the lobby of the hotel. Even though the hotel has a strict guest policy, many people were just mingling in the lobby and taking pictures. In my opinion, they should allow guests during certain time frames rather than the entire day.","5","2011-03"
"Fabulous a must have experience!","We stayed at the Burj for two nights in January and loved it. The room was amazing and the views fantastic. I had read some not so good reviews before we went and was a bit concerned, but found the whole experience to be excellent. 
I loved the decor of the hotel, the colours and layout. We had a high tea which was really good; nearly didn't have one as we had read reviews they were stingy with the food.  I don't know how you could possibly eat any more and they were offering more. You are paying for the view and it is a good experience. We ate at the other restaurant at the top also the seafood underneath where we got a submarine to dinner. Loved the huge fishtank there and must say the food was amazing and the wait staff excellent. We had the best meal in Dubai there (and we went to a lot of restaurants!). The bar at the top was also good, cocktails and view again excellent.
The massage room with the view was absolutely the best I have ever been in, spas all have the same atmosphere, a little sterile really a little quiet music would be nice. 
Breakfast too was really good and one of the best I have had. If you can afford to go only once it is well worth it, and next time I would stay for about 4 days to fully appreciate all the hotel has to offer. Yes it is expensive, but what would you expect from one of the worlds best hotels! 
The only complaint we had was the really strong fragrance in the lift which was horrid.","5","2011-01"
"Much better than expected!","I am almost ashamed to admit, but I wanted to stay here just for the sake of saying that I had stayed here.  From the pictures I had seen online, I felt like the design of the rooms, etc. might not have been exactly my taste.  However, the frenzy surrounding this hotel made me curious, so I decided to stay and see for myself!  All I can say is, I am sure glad that I did!  The suite was much brighter and more tasteful than I expected.  Very roomy.  I suggest getting a panoramic suite to enjoy the amazing views the hotel has to offer.  The full-size Hermes bath amenities were also quite a treat.  The food was fantastic; we did the culinary flight for lunch and we really enjoyed it.  Dinner at Bab al Yam was also quite good.  The service was really attentive and elegant.  It was my mother's birthday, and I felt like at every stop, they made a huge deal of it, singing to her, giving her cakes (we got three birthday cakes in one day!).  This is truly a place to stay if you want to feel special for a special occasion.  I was hesitant about whether I would like this hotel, but upon arrival, all my doubts went away.  I heartily recommend this hotel for someone who likes luxury, spacious suites, personal service, good food and doesn't mind a swarm of tourists swarming the lobby!","5","2011-02"
"Amazing","The hotel is overwhelming both in decor as well as service. Suites offer the highest possible level of comfort and are cleaned everytime guests leave the room. Light snacks and refreshments are also left in the room both in the morning and evening. Non-alcoholic beverages (mini-bar) are complimentary and restocked everytime guests leave the room. Staff is polite and friendly. Butlers were particularly helpful and courteous. Breakfast is served in a number of restaurants (a detail we were not made aware of until our second day). As always, some members of staff are more friendly and efficient than others. The Al-Mahara restaurant is definitely worth trying, as is the spa.","5","2011-02"
"opulence  has a new meaning","this exquisite 6 star hotel re defines luxury.... we had an expansive two floor 2 bedroom suite with panoramic water and city views. a circular stair case connected the 2 floors.the living areas were  furnished in a distinct colourful style with fine woodwork and state of the art room controls. the three bathrooms were luxuriously appointed with detailed marble inlays and mosaics. linens and robes were italian, hermes fragrances in the bath.  the arabic restaurant was ok, but dining on the top floor was amazing. it was patronized by local expats and well worth the experience. we also had drinks at the bar with amazing city views. service is 1st exceptional as expected... and no outside guests are permitted to enter without a reservation at one of the restaurants. this is very strictly enforced. location is excellent for shopping. close to the tower and the mall.","5","2010-03"
"The most luxurious hotel in the world","I had the most wonderful birthday surprise at this hotel. Excellent service by the housekeeping team, reception and butler. The butler showed us around the hotel and escorted us to restaurant, spa and even escorted our guest to get a taxi back home. We arrived in a BMW 7 series saloon. After a warm reception at the hotel lobby with a cold towel and dates, we were escorted to our suite. Checkin was conducted at the business centre in the suite. Very spacious interior within the double storey suite. The bathroom is huge with a good size jacuzzi enough for 2 adults. The separate shower area is very big too! All toiletries are by Hermes (separate for him and her) and they are all in full retail versions (usually hotels would give those miniatures). That includes the perfume and deodorant. We have kids with us and they also provided us with bath robes and slippers for the young ones. The hotel even paid attention to details like sizes of slippers (not just medium, small sizes but more specific like 41, 44, etc) and bathrobes. So we have 4 different sizes of slippers and robes for the family. It feels so personalised! They even have toothbrushes for him and for her.
The view is stunning from the suite. Either you face Jumeirah beach or you face the Atlantis. All unblock view.
Controls for the suite are done through high tech gadgets linked throughout the suites ranging from operating the tv to opening the door and curtains. You can even make dinner reservation from the controls. The butlers are really helpful and all out to please. I ask for some styling products for my hair and the butler returned with a full size gel. SInce it was my birthday celebration, the butler even arranged for a cake to be delivered.
The only thing that didn't make the whole experience perfect is the valet and bell-hop. We checked in first without luggages as part of my birthday surprise. We returned eventually with some luggages later but were left unattended. No one came to check with we needed help with our luggages even when we entered the lobby. We took the escalator with our luggages and still no one noticed. If only this group of staff at the front of the hotel could match the service standard of their peers elsewhere in the hotel, who are doing such great job, would I say this hotel is the best. For now it's just the most luxurious hotel in the world but not the best yet!","5","2011-02"
"Its worth it!","Ended up later in the year than planned due to a certain volcano!Well worth the wait,although it was Rammadam and the temperatures hit the high 40's.however the hotel was really cool.The only little thing that let it down,and we did tell them in a follow up survey,was breakfast...apart from that if you have the chance go for it,its great,perhaps not 7 star or whatever that is but its sublime!","5","2010-08"
"Ultimate luxury in a arabic style.","After seeing the Burj many times on tv, we wanted to stay in the hotel to see it for ourselves. We have travelled a lot and have stayed in great hotels, but this was a exceptional experience. We felt like royalties. 
We stayed in a panoramic suite, which was fantastic. As we we're seated through our floor butler, we thought we sat in some kind of lounge.... But it turned out to be the suite! So spacious, in arabic style, modern gadgets. We enjoyed our room very much. 
We really liked our stay, but sometimes didn't fell in place. We are people that more like the 'barefoot luxury', this was a bit over the top for us.","5","2010-03"
"Excellent","Best hotel in the world. The mere sight shows how grand the hotel is. A class service.","5","2010-05"
"Best home away home experience","I booked this hotel for the weekend because of the special offer and I had never stayed there.  This is a hotel with a lot of ""Wow"" factors.  My husband and I have travelled extensively, but this is the best hotel we ever stayed.  The service is beyond attentive, but the price... Well, this is the place money can buy happiness...
The only downside is the over charged bill which took 45 minutes to settle when we checked out.  Check your bill carefully if you are lucky enough to get a free upgrade.","5","2011-01"
"Amazing hotel just for one visit :)","As a normal suite costs around 2700 dollars and the most expensive around 17000 dollars, we went to visit the hotel for few hours!:), different packages are available, either with lunch or diner included, but a bit expensive of course, or a visit with a snack included. The hotel is really amazing outside and inside. The fountains are great, the lobby, the restaurant, it's worth going. However dont have too many expectations about what you will be able to see, because the only place where you can have a view from the Atlantis, the Palm with sunset is the restaurant at the top of the hotel. YOu are going there indeed, but exactly at the moment when they install the tables, meaning that you can see the windon from 10 meters away, and no chance to get a good picture from the view. After this disappointment however they will bring you to another lobby dowmnstairs to have 2 cocktails and some fingerfood (but really good!!!:)) and an amazing view on the sunset from a really comfortable sofa...for once you would like to have a bit more money to spend few days there!lol. But that's it after that you go back to the shuttle and go away from this palace...nothing else will be shown to you...respect of the privacy you might believe.","4",
"Probably the biggest waste of money ever, terrible service, they could learn a lot.","This hotel has been media hyped for years, son on our return from honeymoon in the Maldives we took a three night stopover. What a complete waste of money, what a disastrous hotel! The staff and management seem to have no understanding of what true service is all about. We had cause to complain about a few items, including rude staff, and when offered a free drink with dinner, we then had to complain again when it was not forthcoming. 

The ethos of this hotel seems to be ""fill our rooms with gadgets and hope it impresses"" . Well quite frankly if i need gadgets I'll go to the gadget shop. Good hotel rooms should be comfortable and welcoming, not representative of something you might find in a hospital or laboratory. Believe it or not you can't even run the bath without calling for the staff....so don;t bother getting comfortable or naked! And don;t assume you'll get any peace and quiet, after being met by an overwhelming number of staff and given a 30 minute tour of the room and all the nonsense gadgets, we were then subjected to a visitor every couple of hours to see if everything was in order.  

We had dinner in the top floor sky view restaurant, and although the food was of a good standard the choice was very limited and the ambiance non existent, the place has no real character. It's decorated like a cheap brothel and feels like a supermarket.

If you like plastic and pretense, then knock yourself out. If you like good service, atmosphere and charm, don't even consider this hotel.","1","2010-08"
"Great stay, but some things were worn out","We stayed at the hotel in August 2008, two adults and 11-year-old daughter. In general the stay was great. We were taken from the airport in a Rolls Royce Phantom, so a nice ride. Instead of calling regular cabs you have lexus cabs at your disposal. They cost the same as a regular cab. We were welcomed by at least 6 members of stuff who new our names, room number, etc. We were accompanied by a floor manager to our room (regular room of 168 sq.m.). Then we were explained by a butler how the things work in our apartment and in the hotel. Everything is breath taking, just small details look a bit worn out already, for example armrest of the armchairs, they had the ""gold"" peeled off. The rest was great: room, equipment, views, staff, juest great. We used both pools: interior and exterior, both were great and almost empty. We dined at all the restaurants they have. All of them were great in all senses: staff, food, interior. We fully recommed the hotel to everybody who wants to taste a bit of oriental luxury. For those who prefer more tasteful western style amenities we recommend to look for something else. This is Emirates special, not a medieval French castle.","5","2010-08"
"An Experence!","My stay at the Burj was great! I really can not fault anything the staff are all friendly , helpful and not pretentious. To get on to the hotel island they as your name conform you have a booking, when you get to the front greeted by name and straight up to the room no waiting around. 
I stayed in a panoramic suite, it has was amazing views back into Dubai two story suite with windows the whole side of the room. Yes the hotel including room has that Arab overdone style gold every where and that's exactly what i expected. Amazing service room is cleaned and restocked every time you step out. 
For the whole experience of the place and considering the size of the suite its not overpriced  (yes it is alot of money but suites in other hotels can be as expensive and you don't get that much for your dollar)
Excellent hotel!!","5","2010-01"
"Once is enough","When in Dubai, this is a must do. Why, because you may never want to return to Dubai. 
Did i enjoy the food? It was average
Did i enjoy the view? not much, lots of ocean
Glad i spent 395 Durhams to say i have been into the Burj? Yes, it is a once in a lifetime thing.
Would i ever do it again? Never
The hotel is certainly magnificent inside, but to have to spend money to see it is disappointing. The Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi is by far a nicer hotel where you can roam for free, and it is far more palatial than the Burj. If you are on a budget, save your money and visit the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi","3",
"Simply the best","From the moment we entered the Burj al Arab, we were treated like visiting royalty.  We arrived late after a hellish day of travel to be whisked to a high room filled with flowers, gifts and fruit.  The room is spectacular, the service perfect, the view breathtaking.  A birthday cake, roses and sparkling cider(we don't drink) arrived with three men who serenaded my husband for his birthday.  The Hermes products are addictive and we left with a years worth.  The beach tote was also gifted and was used to haul all the gifts we bought at the souk next door.  No detail is overlooked.  I especially like the people who work there.  They go so far out of their way to help and make your stay enjoyable.  Next time, we are bringing the whole family and staying longer.  Thank you for a magical stay Burj al Arab!","5","2010-12"
"Mesmerized with the architectural creative visual impact","I have heard a lot about the world’s 4th tallest hotel the Burj Al Arab located in Dubai; one of those must visit places in my wish list. February 4th at around 09:00 hrs I checked in along with my elder brother. We were mesmerized with the architectural creative visual impact that was snapped and showcased in our mind, what we heard about the hotel was less though we had to apply for personal loan to make this wish come true. I was overwhelmed with the hospitality and service that was provided. Why talk about the food and its variety just that I did not like the sushi as always. Things that you would take away as memories are, the luxury, the aristocratic treatment(no exageration), the views, the city by itself etc.. the only question is if you would be able to afford it. And if the answer is yes, just go and see it for yourself!!!","5","2010-02"
"Simply magnificent","My wife and I have just returned from a five-night stay at the hotel, which was my second visit. The rooms, service, food, beach, spa are all outstanding. Our butler, Bhupi, was excellent and attentive. I have stayed in many super deluxe hotels around the world and have yet to find one that is quite as luxurious as this one, justifying the relatively high rates. Dubai itself has mellowed a tad. The frenetic atmosphere that we experienced three years ago has calmed, making the whole experience very enjoyable indeed. Perfect for a short break.","5","2010-11"
"disappointing","I went to the hotel beginning of november as i was on my own a member of staff offered to take my photo ,the member of staff dropped my camera and broke it. I was asked to take it to a camera shop to see if it could be repaired  JOKE !!! The camera was well and truly irrepairable.There was no recompense and I was left with no camera.  7 STARS ? certainly not for this matter.     The hotel has tourists coming to look round which can be an inconvenience","2","2010-11"
"Feel like staying in Heven with a Price to pay !!","Burj Al Arab is one of the few Hotel properties which are memorable for lifetime. One cannot forget the smallest details and services it has got to offer..... Starts from entering the Hotel with a lovely musical fountain at the reception to one of the finest luxury facilities in your personal suite. All the rooms are Luxurious so not to worry in which room you are accomodated. In short it is Gods own abode :)","5","2010-09"
"if you ever wished to stay in a palace of gold, then just check-in Burj Al Arab","Burj Al Arab is luxury redefined.  the hotel is full of panoramic site and beautiful architecture.

"It is the worlds greatest hotel!  It simply is.","I arrived cynical.  I had just stayed in several fantastic hotels and know we're about to pay $2000/night for a room at the famous Burg Al Arab.
It took about 30 seconds and 5 personal greetings (I hadn't even checked in, but the security guard calls ahead so everyone you contact greets you by name) to make me realize I've never imagined a hotel like this.  After touring our upgraded two floor, two bedroom suite, it was clear that this is THE BEST HOTEL IN THE WORLD.  There is no discussion about it.  Anything short of this ranking is silly. 

The view of the palm island ahead of us, the touch screen controls for all room functions, living room, living room off the living room, dining room, in-room business center, two upstairs bedrooms, clock projected on the stairway wall, floor concierge, and butler, were all beyond belief.  Our rate qualified for a sumptuous breakfast buffet, two 50 minute massages, and all the Hermes products in the room we wanted (which was about a total $1,400 value, not that anyone stays here for value).  FYI- our room's second floor alone had 11 telephones.  Downstairs only had 4.  There were 15 telephones in our room!  Everything wasn't just over the top (including taking a submarine virtual reality ride to get to one restaurant, and the endless windows of the roof bar/restaurant hanging on to the side of the building), the service matched it.  FInally, the indoor pool on the 18th floor was luxury on steroids.  A king would call it eye candy.

What a treat.  There can be only one best hotel in the world and this is it.  It would be a crime for a seasoned traveler not to stay here once.","5","2010-11"
"Breathtaking Unique Hotel Experience","After a 4 1/2 hour flight back from the Sechelles on the way home to L.A. we stopped in Dubai for two nights staying at the BAA.  We were greeted by a host at the Jumeirah check in at terminal 3 and quickly escorted to our waiting Rolls Royce.  Smoothest car ride ever.  We were greeted in the breathtaking opulent main lobby with refresing towelet, dates and cardimin coffee.  It was difficult to pay attention to these greeters as we were completely absorbed by our sensory overloaded surroundings.  We were escorted to our floor butler who walked us to our Panoramic Suite 1411.  We were checked into the hotel by our butler while I was seated at our suites desk (which included high speed internet computer, fax & phone) .
In retrospect, we spent very little time at the BAA as we had much to do and see and so little time to do it.  Suffice to say, the service was top rate with the butlers/staff ready to help in any way requested.  They take a copy of your passport photo so that you are always greeted by a smile and name.  Makes you feel recognized.   There was the feeling that we wern't at a hotel but a super luxurious super cruise ship.  We could have very easily enjoyed one additional day and night without leaving the hotel.","5","2010-10"
"Simply The Best","My only problem with the Burj is i have been unable to find a Hotel that surpasses it in all areas.
We have been fortunate to stay on a few occasions.
Usually with a group of families, my children were 5 and 7 when they first stayed, we have always been treated extremely well.
The kids have seen all the nooks and crannies of the hotel, as the butler would take them for an adventure whilst we got ready for our evenings out, the buggy drivers would take them around the resort when the heat became too much on the beach. 
We have eaten in each of the resturaunts, each has its own plus's.
Travelling with a group i have been in each of the different types of suites, the delux was adaquate for us howver the panaramic was great for parties and entertaining. 
We were fortunate to stay in the Royal suite for a night an extravagance probably never to be repeated. I think my wife counted 27 telephones in the suite!! Breakfast at the mad hatters table is still vivid in my memory.
We once dined on the beach at short notice as a surprise for a friend, nothing is too much.
The Burj experience doesnt end when you go out of the hotel. Arriving at another hotel or resturaunt  to dine, they seem to raise their bar to impress. 
If you can stay for a few nights minimum, friends that only stayed for 1 really did not experience the Burj, and were left dissapointed. The staff learn your prefferences and like another review said just as you think you have seen it all, they impress you further.","4","2010-02"
"A must-see in Dubai","Going to Dubai and not going to Burj Al Arab is like going to the beach and not entering the water: it makes no sense. The interior of the hotel is simply amazing, and there are many places one can go and take pictures. 
Granted, one needs to book a place in a restaurant to visit, but it is all worth it. You can opt for a skyview bar with tea and snacks for about $110 or you can get a great buffet in one of the restaurants downstairs for the same price. We went for the latter. We also ordered a couple cocktails (price $25-27). Overall, spent about $350 for the dinner full of lobsters, hand made sushi, traditional Arabic food, and tons of other delicious staff, including five signature cocktails. Plus, dozens of photos and videos of the interior and the restaurant itself. Not missing a single dime of that.","5",
"Consistently excellent hotel.","""Good service is when they meet your needs.  Excellent service is when they anticipate your needs"" 

There is a reason why the Burj al Arab is the only 7 star hotel in the world.  As a high end hotel traveller, my husband and I enjoy trying to outdo ourselves in finding a perfect escape.  We stayed here in 2005 as part of our honeymoon, and upon our return, it only got better with time.  

Not everything goes perfectly well in a hotel.  It is how they handle situations for you is what counts.  We originally planned on staying in the same room where we honeymooned, but it was unavailable.  At any other hotel, I would have been upset, except they made they stay so extrordinary that I missed nothing.  

Butlers anticipate your needs and frequently walk you to the door on your floor to open your room so you dont need to look for your key.  Don't worry, they recognize you by name and face, and its high security. You get the same consistent staff. 

The staff ratio is 5 staff to every one room.  Most other hotels cannot afford a ratio as such, and therefore usually do not provide the same level of service.  Of course this comes with a price.  This is not a value hotel, there is not a ""special sale"" on rooms, and your dont ever see the tour bus coming up with people poruing out taking pictures unless its a private tour by the Burj themselves.  Its a discreet hotel where heads of state, business owners and the affluent come to relax, do some business and unwind.

Some examples of the attentiveness were
-Walking off the elevator, I said to my husband ""oh darn. I forgot my sunglasses.""  The attendant before the pool area said ""I can get your butler to retrieve them for you in your room.""  Not that I had him do it, but it was really nice to think that I had someone willing to get my sunglasses.    
- You never touch your bags.  They offer unpacking service and pressing if you so choose
-Phones are answered immediately
-requests are handled with urgency
-If there is an issue, it is followed up meticulously.  Our safe battery ran out locking our items into the safe, and security was there within 5 minutes.  He had a specialist 5 minutes later, and apologized the entire time.  I was so relaxed, it could have taken and hour, and I knew they were killing themselves to get this done (somehow, I wasn't even bothered by the whole thing- now that's good serivce)
-room service is prompt and over the top.  Ordered toast and coffee, and the butler came in with the toaster and cut off the crust for me. 

Some examples of the ""extras"" were 
- full size Hermes bath products in both bathrooms, 
-tiles in bathroom over tubs is designed by Versace. (may or may not be your taste, but lovely design- I enjoyed it) 
-  fresh fruit in your room with a fingerbowl with water and rose petals.
-water, coffee everything is included in your room including the gorgeous beach bag they give you to use and keep.
-Conceirge is wonderful  Explain your wishes and they will be granted.  They are the expert in the area and can guide you to what will suit your needs.  You can travel by anyting from a local taxi to a helicopter with a Rolls Royce, BWM and Mercedes in between.  (there is a charge of course for utilizing transport)

Where most might consider these barriers to entry (things like price, more discerning service and the fact they dont let any random tourist come up to the hotel or videotape in the lobby) it is more for the discreet service allowing high end guests to enjoy security and privacy.","5","2010-10"
"WoW","Burj al arab, is something unbelievable in the world! I never saw dream something like this bevore, The whole Jumeira Beach is the most luxury place in the world, I ever have seen. Great service, great food, great fair prices, very nice style in al facelitys, only in summer we had problems, if you go from outside 55°c to any place inside 22°C your body allways get a shock.","5","2010-07"
"Heaven on earth","Well we went back this year and we still feel special. Ok it is very expensive but the quality and service is second to none. The only concern we have is where do we go after this because it's so hard to compare. The rooms are to die for and have heard from some guests they find it hard to leave their room as it's like being in heaven,,,,
The staff in bab al yam are special and each time we have returned will remember us by name and this again makes us keep going back. The private beach is spotless and great to watch the world go by the Burj. We are going back soon and to be honest cannot wait.
Thanks to all again who make our stay so fab.","5","2010-05"
"Heaven on Earth","We have just returned from a two night stay in the BAA to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. It was an experience we will never forget.  We have been fortunate enough to stay in many ""Leading Hotels of the World"" for both business and pleasure over the years, but this one took our breath away.
From the moment we arrived at the door we were greeted by name and, even though we were two hours ahead of their check-in time, were taken straight to our suite.
The suite was so beautiful and the view stunning.  The butler(s) were so welcoming and kind.  I was afraid that it might be a bit ""over the top"", but they have their level of service just right. Always there if you want them, but not intrusive. 
We were given a guided tour of the Hotel areas and restaurants. The bookings I had made by email were confirmed and we were escorted to our destinations each time and introduced to the host/ess.

The night of our anniversary we had booked the Al Muntaha and requested ( though not been guaranteed) a window table.  We were again escorted by the butler to the Sky Bar for cocktails , where we were again, greeted by name. We were shown to  a table, but after a few minutes we were told that they had a better one for us, and were moved - we thought that was very considerate, as we had not given any indication that the table we had was not fine. The drinks were were lovely, and to be honest, no more expensive than many we have had in other Hotels. Whilst we were having our drinks they very quietly came over and gave us a red rose and a tiny cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it and two spoons ( we had told them that we did not want ""any indication to other diners of our celebration, as we had witnessed cakes and singing the previous night). 
 When we were taken into the restaurant we were at first given a table in the centre of the restaurant, and we did feel a little disappointed, but knew we were not guaranteed a window seat, so said nothing.  Again the hostess returned and told us that ""they now had a very nice table available for us"" - it was wonderful, a lovely round table in the corner - by the window, with amazing views, as we both looked out foward, over the shoreline and city, and not at any other diners, - very romantic.  (it might have been our 40th anniversary, but we still ""do"" romantic, which is why we have happily got to 40 years!! )
The food was wonderful, the service perfect, and at the end they ( again, discreetly )bought a beautiful full sized cake. We asked if it was possible to take it with us and it was boxed up so well that we were able to bring it home with us.

All our other experiences of the beach, pool, breakfast (and even a paramedic attending to me when I cut my leg!) were first class.

I don`t know if the managment read these reviews, but we would like to them to pass on our thanks to all their staff for making our anniversary so special,  We were very touched by all the consideration we were afforded throughout our stay and, yes... we can`t wait to return.","5","2010-10"
"Excellent stay","3rd visit to this hotel, in as many years and must say was again excellent, in every dept, yes cost is high but if you want a special treat its worth it.

Rooms are excellent, and hotel is very hard to fault, did notice some small details that have changed but would guess this is due to economic downturn that is world wide, but still a great stay, would recommend this hotel to anyone","5","2010-08"
"Stunning","Great architecture work, Beautiful interiors, Amazing location, Dramatic views and a stunning experience. The staff was very friendly and courteous and that was an experience. Two days was too short to enjoy it. Spent a lot of time figuring how they did it.","5","2010-08"
"Still an Excellent Hotel and an icon.......","Staying at Burj Al Arab has a completely a different feeling compared to any hotel around the world..... it is an Icon... The stuff that you find in this hotel are one of a kind...

The Suites are massive even the smallest suite is a 2 level suite with amazing amenities and an excellent quality all around... Staying at Burj Al Arab is all about luxury everywhere you go at this iconic tower...

1 of the best thing you can do is swimming at the indoor swimming poool on the 18th floor which has an amazing view of Dubai and the beautiful beaches.... 

In room dining is also very good with so many choices and the food quality is Excellent..

The only downside to the whole experience could be the many tourist who just keep taking photos everywhere in the entrance and the lobby area!!! 

The Burj Al Arab will always have its own appeal and you can't ignore the hotel is built on its own man made island which give is it a very exclusive feeling...","5","2010-09"
"A nice stay","Had a good stay at Burj Al Arab though not sure on the vaue for money offered.
The sky bar was good but again fairly pricey. Great views and nice to have done but all in all I prefer some of the other 5 star hotels in Dubai (that are cheaper)","3","2010-08"
"Only the rooms make it outstanding, but worth a visit","i was lucky to have the possibility to have a show aroung through the whole hotel and its suites. i gotta say, that rooms are outstanding, huge suites, all have 2 floors and bedrooms and a very nice view. The skybar is worth a visit for its view, but i think that the rest of the restaurants is not so special, you can have it in other places also. but anyways, it's worth a visit just to have a look at it.","4",
"Amazing building, service problems","I travelled to the Burj with my husband for our honeymoon. If you are into architecture and design, this hotel is for you. You will be in awe just to walk into the lobby. The duplex rooms are incredible. 
We did have some service issues though. For starters, the safety deposit box did not work, they took 24 hours to fix it! 24 hours! Our doorbell did not work as well so people walked in as my husband was napping. We wanted to sent a postcard when we were leaving and the butler said sure, please pay me in cash now 2 euros. Come on! Bill it to our room or just offer the complimentary service. It is a hassle to be walking out with travel documents and try to find 2 euros like you are at a coke machine!
The Burj has very strict entry codes for outsiders but I felt that it was stuffy for guests as well. We wanted to get to know the hotel restaurants and bars and they make it very hard for you. 
Overall, I'd suggest going for the experience, but would probably not stay again","3","2010-08"
"Hard to imagine","Having been to Dubai twice before, we opted to stay at the bur al Arab for 2 nights.

The hotel kindly allowed us to check in at 9am and gave us a late check out so we could move straight into the jumeriah beach hotel 2 days later.

We wanted to fly to the baa, however the helicopter flight has a 100% cancellation charge and since the time is fixed we daren't risk the flight from the uk arriving late. The BMW the hotel sent was just as good

The room was stunning, split onto 2 floors I counted enough seating downstairs for 15 people, then the remote control curtains, pop up tv, laptop in the room and the decor is hard to describe.  The room had 2 minibars and a mountain of fruit.

On leaving we got a complimentry BMW to the jumeriah beach.

Would I stay there again?......yes, if I won the lottery!","5","2010-08"
"Burj Al Arab","March is high season, best weather, most expensive but the weather was great. We stayed in a 360 panoramic suite, 2 floors, private butler service, best view in Dubai imo. This is my favorite hotel in the world and a great location. You can see anywhere in Dubai from the living room or bedroom, as well as a nice view of the Palm Island. Next time I go will be in the off season, but I shall return.","5","2010-03"
"Burj al Arab - The most luxurious Hotel in the World","Known as the best Hotel in the World the Burj al Arab, henceforth appreviated to BAA reflects the ultimate in luxury. The unique and stylish shape of the Hotel is only half as breath-taking as the Hotel appears from the inside. The interior is mainly made of Gold with luxury shops and restaurants inside. It is a pure suite Hotel, the smallest of which are over two levels. The price for the cheapest Suite is app. 1500€/night. 
On the top level of the Tower (of the Arabs) the sky bar is located. The Design of this exclusive bar reminds on the 70s. I can strongly recommend this bar not only because of its unique cocktails and significant view on palm jumeirah.","5","2009-05"
"Lovely, relaxing and friendly!","After beeing inside this hotel twice before having friday brunch, we decided this time we would stay here for a couple of nights. Not quite knowing what to expect, but maybe a bit formal/""highnosed"" staff etc. we arrived. From that moment everybody was so friendly and smiling. The check in went smoohtly, we were offered cappucino in the cafe at arrival.We had asked for a nonsmoking, kingbedded, high floor room and that was what we got! The room and the view was just lovely -free dates, wine and cookies!
Butler James was so friendly and took us for a tour of the hotel and offered some free white wine -thank you! The spa in 18th floor was really beautiful - I took a swim in the early morning and by sunset and they even spindry your swimsuit for you before you leave!
We ate breakfast and buffetlunch at Junsui and that was just marvellous! Top foodquality and so kind, helpful and nice staff. The groundfloor cafe was also good for breakfast. The swimmingpool-area was good and so was the service! We didn't have time to try the beach. The duvet was to die for!! And the Hermes-conditioner was just perfect for my long hair - I even got some extra when leaving! Thank you so much everyone for very good and friendly service. We hope to come back and stay a little longer next time!","5","2010-07"
"The Burj- excellent service","Lovely hotel with excellent service.
Creaky floorboards in the rooms and the Skyview Cocktail bar, get scrumptious tea and coacktails daily. You won't need to look out for uneven creaky floors : it will always find you. Beautiful hotel, OTT on the gold and glitz in a limited altough huge space.
Yeah, worth every penny.","4","2009-10"
"7 Stars. I really don't think so","We were really looking forward to our stay in this iconic hotel, but from the moment we stepped out of the car it was down hill from there. 
The staff were so busy arguing amongst themselves that I was nearly knocked over twice. 
We then made it into the hotel where you are sat down and offered dates. After about ten minutes of not knowing what was going on we were then escorted to our rooms.
The rooms are definately the wow factor on two levels with stunning views. Tacky yes but great fun. 
Whilst we were being shown the functionality of the room we were then asked to pay even though they had my credit card details. As I was paying cash they then asked for an additional £300.00 or AED 1,500 for additional costs incurred in restaurants and the like. It left me feeling as though I wasnt to be trusted.
The service in all restaurants is poor and the temperature of these areas could be a lot better.
All in all there are far better hotels in Dubai.","2","2010-07"
"Simply amazing","I'm very late with this review, but wow what an amazing hotel.
Suites - fantastic, huge beautiful and with wonderful view, The jaccuzzi bath was huge and the bathroom was full of Hermes toiletries, not baby sizes either.
Service- just ridiculously wonderful, butler unpacked for us and came with food treats every evening and boxed gifts were on the bed every night, 
Pool very small, but again wonderful service, cold towels fruit etc and comfi loungers.
Beach - very nice, great service. A buggy takes you from the front of hotel over the bridge to the beach.
Food was good, not great and simply mad prices, £35 for a hamburger at lunchtime.
Checking out was a nightmare and at the time, probably why I couldn't be bothered to write the review for ages. The staff were new and put our card through twice and we subsequently had real difficulty in getting the refund, but hey ho.
Dubai - lots of great hotels, we went to the Jumeirah and another couple that I cannot remember the names, all good. If you are looking for culture, history or anything other than sun, good hotels, sun and good hotels Dubai is not for you.
We had a great time, who couldn't at the Burj, it's simply 1st class luxury.","5","2009-02"
"it's worth it","make this lifetime experience. although expensive it's worth it. if y want to compare
with others you must know the top and that's the one.
no other comments 100 % performed","5","2009-07"
"Absolutely amazing!","I had to write something as I am completely shocked at the bad reviews of this amazing hotel! 
We stayed for our honeymoon on the 25th floor and had nothing but good service,a stunnin suite, amazing meals and a wonderful wonderful holiday! 
The hotel was gorgeous, the staff couldn't help us enough in booking excursions (Jeep Safari was fantastic) and answering any questions in any way! The scenery was beautiful and the weather ideal!
I would recommend it 100% and would love to return.","5","2007-08"
"Fantastic, A must just once in your life","Amazing experience well worth all the money which the holiday cost however, not what you would call a bargin.  Staff and managers treated us like royality and nothing was ever too much trouble.  Fantastic arrival by rolls royce and loved the in suite features.  Dinner was an experience which I will always remember for the rest of my life. Well Done everyone at the Burj","5","2008-02"
"Superb Luxury but Disappointing Food","My Husband took me on a blow out trip to the Burj al Arab. I really didn't know what to expect and was worried that it would actually be dreadfully tacky.
The architecture of the building was superb, the rooms are out of this world and top class service.
The suites are on two floors with such luxury, all glittering, marble and mirrors on the ceiling!
There is a butler to attend to your every need but I must admit that this can get a little wearing when staff want to keep bustling in an out of your room to fluff up and clear away non-existent mess.
The bar at the top is like walking through an arcade game but once seated at the window, the views are amazing.
Drinks at this place cost an arm and a leg and I do have to confess that I was desperately looking forward to eating at the 'underwater restaurant' but the food was a dreadful disappointment. Wine fantastic but, for the price it needed to be!!
Our favourite parts - when the Butler ran the huge jacuzzi bath and filled with flowers, oils and put champagne and strawberries on the side (for a large fee of course). And the most attentive lifeguard in the world who perched at the edge of the pool at all times, fully equipped for an emergency rescue, when really all you had to do was stand up:-)","5","2007-10"
"An unforgetable Honeymoon","We arrived in Dubai at the Burj al Arab around noon on May 9th and we were greeted by security before we were even allowed on the property. The Burj al Arab is renowned for it exclusivity and privacy as you are only allowed on the premises by either a reservation or a paid tour. We exited the car and were greeted at the door by name, “Welcome Mr and Mrs Sawyer,” and our luggage was quickly taken away. I did not even see who took it. We were escorted to a sitting area in the lobby where we were handed iced towels offered sugar dates to nibble on. In a matter of minutes we were escorted to our room, room 1105 . Our suite was actually on the 22nd floor since all rooms are 2 stories. I gazed in amazement as we went up the main escalator at the wall size aquariums filled with ice blue water and exotic fish. Up the elevator we went to our floor and was shown our floors private guest service desk that was there only for our convenience. We were shown our room and was greeted by our floor butler (there is one butler designated for each floor) where he offered fresh squeezed orange juice and more sugared dates. He showed us around our suite explaining each area and pointing out all the complimentary items and services we are given as a guest, including: gourmet cookies and dates, fresh fruit, laptop in the office with wifi. He explained to my husband (I say my husband because I was so WOW´d with the room that I stopped listening) how the remote worked. The remote controlled everything in the room from the curtains to the TV to the front door and the entrance and even the surveillance camera (you always know who’s knocking at the door). We were taken upstairs where the butler showed us the comfort menu and the pillow menu (no joke, there were 13 different types of pillows for us to choose from). He showed us the bathroom and pointed out the complimentary his and hers Hermes products (shower gel, lotion, body spray, bath salts, shampoo, conditioner). You have seen the pictures and saw how opulent the hotel itself it. It´s an amazing place to see.

Everyone went out of their way to pamper and spoil us and we will be returning soon and we will be taking our daughter with this.","5","2010-05"
"SPA: beatiful decore and poor treatment","This hotel used to be one of the symbols of Dubai and expectations of travellers are extremely high. I was one fo them expecting something very special. Interior is impressive and over the top, a bit too much for my taste through, Suites are very spacious and comfortable, rooftop restaurant features great veiw. Beach is private which shoud be good from the first look, but it is overcrowded and service is not perfect due to that. The sea is not the best, looks absolutely dead. In Dubai a bit further  down away from the Palm the sea and beaches are much better, The biggest dissapointment was the spa, being additcted to spas I always use them  regularly in the hotels I stay. This time I never came back to the spa again even though I stayed for over a week.

Spa positive impressions: It is good that the spa has a number of products and not just one including best brands. The attention you get from employees in the changing room and assistance you get is outstanding, it looks like the staff ratio is over 2 staff members per guest . 
Negative impresions: the professionalism of the terrapists was quite poor. No right quetions aked about the pressure, the temperature, the music, no explanation of the product. The terapist looked careless and the feelings about the massage and later facial were the same. Having spent half a day there and aroundr 900 USD on a couple of treatments looking for great experience I left completely dissapointent. Attention from the spa reception ladies and other service ladies could not change the overall impression.","4","2010-01"
"Amazing. Truly 7 star. All rooms are duplex facing the Persian Gulf.","Truly 7 star. 

Check-in was handled by an assigned conceirage, whom would bring you to your room and give out a detail introduction to all features in the room and the hotel.
We were served with welcome drinks (Orange Juice and Champange) while the conceirage was doing the in-room orientation. 

All rooms are duplex facing the Persian Gulf. 

Personal conceirage on each floor.

All accessories in bathroom are made by Hermes 

Jacuzzi in the bathroom.

HP Laptop and printer is provided in-room. Laptop is connected to wired highspeed internet.

Has private beach

Extremely great service. At midnight, one of my family members required medical attention and so we called the conceirage for assistance. They got doctors stationed in the hotel however the doctor suggest to send him to hospital. They got us the ambulance and transported our family member to a very high end hospital in downtown. 

We had lunch at the french restaurant the next day and it was really delicious. 

Cannot think of anything negative other than the fact that it is expensive","5","2008-09"
"Exquisite!","I stayed here for two nights courtesy of my employer, It's hard to describe how nice the Burj Al Arab is. I honestly do believe this is the equivalent of heaven on earth if your not paying the expenses', I would highly recommend this stunning hotel to anyone even if it means cancelling your next holiday in order to save up for it. It's one of these places where you really do have to see it with your own eyes to believe how spectacular a hotel it really is. Need i say more...","5","2009-10"
"Amazing rooms but service not meeting all expectations","When you get to stay in this hotel expectation is very very high, and yet you can be disappointed.

On the positive side, rooms are awesome, the most basic room is probably bigger than most of the presidential suites of other hotels. Not only it is very wide but full of equipment (PC, printer, ...) and of nice amenities such as Hermes perfume and toiletries. Staff are very attentive and quite helpful, even if some of the butlers are clearly not up to level expected.

On the negative side, and since I came first for business, printing 10 sets of a 24 page presentation became a nightmare since there is no business center in this hotel. It took me a couple of hours trying to get this done. Of course I did manage to get the documents printed, but it was much more complicated than in any other hotel I have stayed. Then again, no binding machine !!!
Laundry services are not up to par, ""express"" service is taking 5 hours ???? Basic demands such as receiving folded shirts are not attended on first request, you need to show to the staff what was indicated on the laundry form to get it done.
Another small detail, pretty minor thing yet when you get charged this amount of money you expect a faultless service : I was offered to request any newspaper for daily delivery during my stay, I picked one but it was not delivered: the first day I got another newspaper in same language with apologies, and then nothing !
Altogether a nice experience to know the place but service was disappointing.","3","2010-05"
"Everything it said to be","Since we were going to visit Dubai, decided to splash out and spoil ourselves with an overnight stay this renowed hotel. Weren't we glad we did! There were a lot of the WOW factors in the hotel and about. We felt that we couldn't take enough pictures even though we'd seen enough ones on the internet before our trip.

The staff were very friendly and attentive. The pool on the 18th floor is a must visit, even if just for a look at the view without a dipping in the pool. The other best part is the freedom of visiting the other two hotels and beaches nearby using the free buggy available at any minute. Shoud definitely go to see Mina and its beach. 

The only disappointment is the sighseeing elevator. The speed was too fast to see anything.","5","2010-05"
"Burj Al Arab - Absolute Awe","First and Foremost , this hotel is one of the luxuriest place on Planet Earth.The Hotel has all the Extra ordinary things inside it .. Health Club .. SPA .. Tennis Lawn on Top Floor  and what not.I visited this hotel when i was in Dubai .A must place to be visited in Dubai.I was offered a duplex suite with private business facilities and the latest in technology.Near by is the Wild Wadi water park .. where we can energise ourself .. The display in the luxury hotel includes the gold plated opulence, the marvellous circular ballroom and the  spectacular choreography .
One of the  Restaurant inside it is named as ""Al Mahara"" where they provide perfect blundered sea food . Wow man..and almost all the restaurants inside are about 200 mts above sea level
There are about six restaurants inside Burj Al Arab , having food inside the restaurants is itself a pleaseure mixed with adventure .Jumeriah and other near by places also can be added in the visiting list .Do have a stay at Burj Al Arab- Royal Place ..... at Royal Emirate - Dubai :-)","5","2010-04"
"If only every day could be like staying in the Burj!","I stayed at the Burj on my quick trip through Dubai on the way to London. I only wish I had allowed more time as there were so many things to see and do.

The hotel remains one of my fondest memories. The rooms are sprawling, with two levels of pure luxury. The decor has to be seen to be believed. The mixture of blue, gold and red shades all finished off with chandeliers and gold fittings really do work. It adds such atmosphere to the stunning location. 

I have stayed in luxury hotels throughout the world and have found nothing to rival the Burj. In fact, the Burj Al Arab has become my marker for true luxury. Unfortunately almost everything falls terribley short of such an immense standard.

I would recommend staying at the Burj for anyone who appreciates oppulence and has the budget to accommodate such taste. It is a hotel frequented by Royalty, thus it really has an air of refinement.","5","2009-11"
"Fantastic","Perfect place to stay for a long weekend. Everyone knows the place is totally over the top but its really a must at least once in a lifetime. The suites are amazing & the views are unforgetable.....the only slight downers were small pool (expected I guess on a man-made island) and restaurants which were OK but overpiced especially if you have kids","5","2007-09"
"Amazing but pretentious!","I spent a week at the Mina A Salam then stayed at the Burj. The hotel itself is amazing with all the architecture, the reception is so grand! Rooms are lovely, with a remote to control curtain, open the door e.t.c. We were greeted with cocktails in our room and our floor butler introduced himself. Just to mention to everyone - when I stayed they gave away free Hermes gifts in the bathroom worth over £200! Food was brilliant - could not fault it at all, I mean good god I was given a choice of 11 mustards with my steak!! Views are fantastic from the room and restaurant. 

So what was disappointing...it is predominantly a business hotel, so the people in suit DO turn their nose up at you in summer clothes. Also, the pool is very poorly placed it doesn't get the sun until midday so we ended up going back to the Mina pool. 

All in all, something you must experience but not for a full weeks holiday! Also, there's a water park nearby, literally about a 5min walk away, go there too it's awesome just don't lose you bikini bottoms on the upwards slide!","4","2007-10"
"Millionaires paradise! The experience of a lifetime.","Most opulent, luxurious hotel you can come across! Rooms are amazing, restaurants are gorgeous. The staff are some of the best in the world, they would do absolutely anything for you. I stayed for 1 week with my 6 year old daughter, who loved the beach and the buggies that take you all over. You have access to the whole Jumeriah resort, which is HUGE. The only negative comment I have about the whole hotel is the pool area, it is lovely but not very large, therefore you cannot swim for exercise only a dip to cool down. 
The hotel food and drinks are extremely expensive, but this should be expected with the 7* quality of the hotel that is frequented by the stars! (we shared a lift wth Ronan Keating!)
You must stay at this hotel even if for 1 night, as it really is an experience of a lifetime. We had an amazing weeks holiday!","5","2010-04"
"Just one of those things in life you must do","Not much needs to be said here really, my boyfriend and I stayed here on our last night of our holiday, were were picked up and on entry to the car I was given a beautiful orchid, arriving at the hotel , well WOW! The suite was amazing upstaris and downstairs , great views, plush suite, the hotel really sells itself! The pool is lovely and appreciate the face spray and cold towels that are brought around. We had dinner in the under water resturant which again was pricey but amazing, also make sure you check out the resturant at the top with the grand piano its beautiful! Great amazing place defo has the WOW factor","5","2008-10"

A bit pricey but well worth the mone.","5","2009-03"
"Its just a paradise on earth...........","i booked da hotel n da mids of june wid my client nd i wz amazed to see the ambience and hospitality of the staff and the entire crew of the hotel.The shape of the hotel makes you feel as if you are sailing in the middle of an ocean.The accessories of the rooms of the hotel were made up of pure gold.Ientered into the hotel in a luxurious chauffer driven car provided by the hotel itself.it is truly a great piece of art nd truly resembles the Arabian royal culture.This hotel is in its real sense known as the trade mark of the United Arab Emirates.It would be my pleasure to visit this hotel again,if given a chance........Thankyou.","4","2009-06"
"Great Hotel - but a few issues","The hotel was what I was expecting, however there were a few issues.
1. Avoid the seventh and nineth floors, the eight floor is a plant floor, I need a near silent environment to get to sleep, the noise from the eight floor was therefore not helpful.
2. Hotel has tour parties arriving to view the hotel, this seems to be a problem as these people just get in the way.
3. Pool side bar, we were served warm bear and white wine.
4. Our party was six people, the Al Mahara resturant, seems to be set up for tables of two and four, I you are six they seem reluctant to give you a reservation, just pass the problem to your butler, he will sort it our.  
5. Menu system in room is only in Arabic and English.","4","2010-03"
"Perfect Start for my honeymoon","This place DEFINITELY lives up to the hype...wooow! what a place...i started my honeymoon in this hotel..it was worth every Dirham i paid...their wagyu burger (room service) loves up to the legend!..the view from the room was too good!
I have given full points for everything except the service. That was becuase on the day we were supposed to leave to airport, the hotel did not inform us that the Airline car was waiting for us downstairs..the car left and we ended up taking a cab instead. Burj Al Arab should have provided us with one of the many Rolls they claim to have to drive customers back and forth to the airport..apparently this service was free once open a time and is no longer the case...you have to pay for it now...","5","2008-06"
"You have the money - now use 'em!","No need for a lenghty review!
My girlfriend and I stayed here our last night in Dubai, just for the hell of it. Got a nice price due to the effects of the creditcrunch. And even though this was a standard suite, it REALLY rocked. The friendliest staff I have ever met and the service was outstanding. They even offered to pack out our suitecase. We had livingroom and businesscenter downstairs and bedroom and bathroom upstairs, roomservices twice a day.

Used all spa and beach facilities the last day and went onto the airplane feeling relaxed as ever. If you have the money, use them on a night at The Burj. It's SO worth it and a memory for life.

Hope to stay here again.","5","2009-05"
"Dont bother....","As a keen travel photographer, while on a stopover in Dubai i thought I'd get some pictures of the Burj Al Arab.  This was a mistake - anywhere one can get an interesting picture from is either owned by the Burj or adoining hotels and they are quite firm about not letting one within a mile or so.

It is a hotel - and priviate - and as such they have every right I hear you say.  However as Dubai uses this structure as one of its pin ups for tourism and travel one may be expected to be able to actually stand and look at whats in the Travel agents window / brochure.  This is akin to someone buying land around Buckingham Palace / Taj Mahall etc and asking for a reservation for a very pricey meal so one can see the landmark.  I know one can book into the hotel / an adjoining hotel for food but this, in my mind, disqualifies this structure as a world site on the tourist trail.  Anyhow - the Burj Dubai was very impressive and they seem immensley proud of it and love you taking photos of it.  The sooner the Burj al Arab slips quietly off to obscurity the better.","1",
"heaven on earth","The best hotel i have visit in my whole life.... it's like being hosted in heaven","5","2009-11"
"Best of the Best!!","I am so glad that I chose to stay at the Burj al Arab.  It was a great experience for me and for my teenage son (16).  We now know how it feels to be treated like royalty! 

We felt so special as we were driven across the connecting bridge to the hotel since not everyone is able to do so.  Security is very tight and we were grateful for that!  
Upon arrival we were greeted by smiling courteous staff as our luggage was wisked away to our suite.   We were given fruit, dates, and beverages upon entering the hotel before being shown to our suite.  The lobby is spectacularly beautiful with large glass wall aquariums beside each escalator and dancing fountains.  Indescribable beauty!

There is a staffed desk on each floor for the sake of privacy.  This is where we were checked in.  You are never ever waiting in line for hotel check or check out.   We experienced peace and privacy. We never felt crowded or qued.  The staff was right there for us at all times.  We never had to wait  long for anything that we requested.

Our suite was on 2 levels and the rooms were  immaculate and well appointed.   The butler  explained what we needed to know regarding our suite such as where things were and how things worked.  Everything was 'state of the art'. My 16 year old requested a 'Play Station' and it was installed within the hour.  
Fresh flowers, fruit, wines and fruit candies were there for us to enjoy.  There were 2 sets of full sized Hermes toiletries (his and hers).  The matresses were  felt wonderful.   More full sized toiletries were left on our pillows (La Prairie) and sleep spray for evening 'turn down' service.  The floor was also vacumed and mats and slippers left during turn down service.   No detail was left unattended.  There were lots of other amenities like full sized tote bags to take to the beach, etc.  More than I can list here.
Our views were to the sea.......and beautiful.

There is a large, fantastic indoor pool and a smaller one outdoors with a 'swim up bar'.  There is free admission to the Wild Wadi Water Park with shuttles to take you the short distance there.   The little shuttle carts also take you to the beach and to the other two nearby Jumeira hotels, etc.
There is a fabulous full service spa with every imaginable amenity!

I can't write enough about how well we were treated and how courteous the staff were.
I noted a discreet sign  sign in the lobby  that requests that no photos be taken for the sake of patron privacy.
We  did note quite a few celebities there during our stay.  We are not celebrities but from what I could see, we were treated just as well as any celebrity.

I realize that we could have spent less money at some other  5 star hotels and there are many beautiful ones in Dubai to choose from.    I will not try to compare hotels since each is special and unique in its own way.   Perhaps on our next visit we will stay at a different  hotel for a different experience.   Each is to be appreciated for what it has.

We didn't go to Dubai with the idea of cutting corners or saving money by trying to find an equal experience for cheaper........you get what you pay for!  
We wanted to have fun and enjoy the finest !
Life is short and this experience should be on your life's bucket list of things to do  if you are visiting Dubai......even if just for a couple of nights.....it is well worth it!","5","2009-12"
"Quite an experience! But is it really worth the rate?","We have stayed at this hotel at a discounted rate thinking that you should at least once in your lifetime stay there if you fancy 5 star hotels.

After a tiring flight back from China, we were driven to the Burj Al Arab.  Security at the gate is high and they would not let you in easily.  However, when we entered the lobby, we were greeted as if we were tourists who had come to take a few pictures.  The attitude suddenly changed when they realised we were guests. They should understand that they should always treat you with respect, whatever the purpose of your visit.  We were shown the hotel facilities, including the restaurants.  They are insisting a bit too much for you to stay in and eat in the hotel restaurants, asking you if they can make a reservation for you.

The room (panoramic suite) was extremely large, with views on the city and beach.  The room was clean, food and wine had been provided, the TVs and the laptop with internet connection were ready to be used.

The private beach is fantastic although quite small. You get ice cold water, body spray and wet towels to protect you from the heat.  Shower facilities at the beach are great as well.  The pool at the back is very disappointing and can only fit a few kids.  However, you get free access to Wild Wadi water park which was, on the other hand, too crowded.

The restaurant offering the buffet was quite pricey but the staff and food were great.  The breakfast is great and astonishingly cosy as it is in a small area at the back of the hotel.

On the whole, you have to admit this hotel is a true 5-star luxury experience.  The positives are cleanliness, facilities, incredible design of the hotel and rooms, staff and food.
The main negative point is that you feel you are in an artificial facility ruled by money.  Some staff are cocky and treat you like a meaningless tourist because they know you are only staying 2 nights for the experience, while others overdo it and treat you like the richest king on the planet which can make you feel uncomfortable, especially when the butler follows you in your room and constantly asks whether you need anything.

But I’d recommend it for 1 or 2 nights, just for the experience.  You will probably end up appreciating “normal” 5 stars hotels even more because they can offer a lot of the same things for a fourth of the Burj Al Arab’s price!","5","2009-08"
"Over the top","This was the most unique and lavish hotel I have ever stayed in.  The two-story rooms were absolutely beautiful as was the view from both inside  the room and the hallway. From the underwater  restaurant to the Skyhigh bar, they have thought of everything here.  Service, amenities, atmoshere rival the world's finest hotels.","5","2008-11"
"Iconic Burj Al Arab- The highest standard of kindness and hospitality","Growing up from the Arabian Gulf on an island 280 metres from the shores of the renowned Jumeirah Beach stands the iconic Burj Al Arab. Every characteristic, and view from this uncompromised accomplishment of make up can only be described as dazzling! Direct from the  airport one expects knows the highest standard of kindness and hospitality. This sumptuous, suite-only hotel expects its guests to be challenging, secure in the awareness that it’s extremely capable staff can convey -  faultlessly. 

In  my Opinion ideal for the most challenging of guests not wishing to compromise on any characteristic of their trip, similarly any holidaymaker who wishes to be amazed just by the splendour of this place and its staff will not be disappointed  by this option.","5","2010-01"
"amazing","it's truly amazing one of our best experience to stayed in burj al-Arab for one whole week
the food is great and my favorite is breakfast food..the view is awesome and for sure they will treat you like king and queen","5","2007-09"
"Great experience","We decided to stay for one night at the Burj al Arab on our way home from Mauritius on our honeymoon. Yes, it is expensive but we thought it was a fabulous experience and really thought it was worth it. The room was absolutely amazing, split over two levels and with great views over Dubai and the sea. We did get a lot of time at the hotel arriving early in the morning and leaving after lunch the next day, but it would have been nice to stay two nights. They have an amazing beach where you get free water all the time and you can also use the water park at the adjoining hotel and there are lots of small free golf carts going between the hotel, the beach and the water park.

There are also lots of nice restaurants. It wasn’t that busy when we were there so it was fine to book on the day. We had an amazing meal at the beach, which was very romantic but I would really have liked to have time to go to the fish restaurant famous for their big fish tank. Again it wasn’t cheap but it was so much fun and if you can afford to splash out and do it I would definitely go for it.

We were in doubt whether to splash out and stay here but we were so glad we did and I would really recommend it – it is something we will remember forever.","5","2009-05"
"The Most Luxurious Holiday","That hotel is perfect, the better one I've ever been! I felt like a princess... The hotel is beautiful, the food is delicious, the service is amazing... Of course is very expansive, but it is very fancy and luxurious... And the new year's eve party was... incredible!","5","2009-12"
"Brash Sail in the Sea...","The ""Burj"" is quite the vista as you pass the security post and trundle along the cuaseway to the manmade circle in the Arabia Sea - its lobby and arrival area is vast & colourful and swarming with Asian tourists. We were appointed a room which has a serious bathroom odour, so after multiple complaints and refusual of an air freshner can we were moved to a cleaner room. This room did not fail to impress, with its winding straircase and limitless views of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel it was exactly what was needed to recover the situation. 
The main difficulty in this hotel, and there are not many, is that all the staff seem to be fro mainland China or Asian with emerging English language skills - this can be a challenge if your ear is not tuned - the skyview bar is worth a trip but does look a little like a pimps wardrobe. Worth a day trip only...","2","2009-10"
"It truly is as fabulous as everyone says!","We stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon after taking some reviewers' advice that one night wasn't enough. So glad we did because we didn't even want to leave the second night! The Rolls Royce transfer is an absolute must to arrive there because it makes your progression through the airport so much easier. I loved the music menu offered by the chauffeur and of course the roses. If you're into details, ask for one of the new custom-made Phantoms, they have a nicer interior than the standard ones.

We stayed in the Panoramic Suite, which I think is the best value for money taking everything into account. Upon arrival, our suite wasn't ready because we were so early so they offered us the Deluxe Suite as a temporary suite. The view of our Panoramic Suite was much better and apparently the ones on levels 9 and 10 are the biggest. 

There were a couple of small hiccups with the butler service, just a couple of messages that didn't get through but overall, the service is exceptional - especially at the Al Bab Yam (I think that's what it's called - poolside restaurant) for breakfast. We had a (very expensive) massage at the spa which I thought was divine but my hubby disagrees. Skyview bar is worth a visit for drinks at night and so is the aquarium restaurant.

I loved the men's & women's pool area, loved the Hermes toiletries provided in all the showers & toilets. Try to visit the hotel boutique, they have a Burj pen set and towels at good prices. The hotel has Lexus taxis for the exclusive use of hotel guests which cost the same as normal taxis so make use of these!

We scrimped in the European part of our honeymoon to stay at this hotel and we are so glad we did. Even though this was meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime visit, now that we know what we're missing out on, we are planning to return next year!","5","2009-09"
"The Ultimate !!!","The treat of a lifetime!!! The closest feeling to Royalty you will ever get. The hotel lives up to its 7 stars in every way. Luxury cars, rooms, restaurants and a view to die for. The service is next to non  and super friendly and obliging beyond the call of duty. Great location with use of the facilities of the surrounding hotels which you can walk to or be driven by golf buggy. The spa is an absolute must too. The only downside is having to leave.","5","2009-11"
"Absolutely Amazing Hotel, What an Experience!!","My Husband and I stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights whilst visitng Dubai for the first time, we had heard about it so just wanted to experience it for ourselves. We were picked up by a Rolls Royce from the airport and I was greeted with a beautiful bunch of roses and a very happy driver. Let me say that it was the best Hotel that we have ever stayed in and we travel alot so not much really impresses me these days. The service and the staff were absolutely fantastic and the room was more like a double story house. What I loved was everything was complimentary plus you have your own butler on your floor. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We didnt leave the hotel for the whole time we were there and the private beach is worth the money on its own. The hotel was really beautiful, a very relaxing place to stay and not too busy, we were there for Christmas. I would recommend catching the golf buggie around the area and exploring the area, make the most out of the VIP areas as you have to be a hotel guest to pass. I cant wait to take my family back there for another holiday next year. I think if you are going to Dubai and if you can afford it at least just stay 1 night to say that you have been there. Enjoy!!","5","2009-12"
"good place","clean & comfortable. good services. good location. very enjoyable stayed.","5","2007-06"
"Outrageous Experience","It would have been oh so easy to be disappointed with all the hype about this hotel but it is an amazing place. Even with the restrictions for tourists getting into it it can be a bit of a zoo down at the gate but once you are whisked inside you discover a hotel where service is the key. No half hearted efforts here everyone is there to ensure that you have an enjoyable experience whether that is vegging out in the suite, having a meal (and the afternoon tea is one of the best I've had), or planning some excursion. I'm not sure if it's really seven stars (whatever that means) but it's certainly easily a cut above any other five star hotel.","5","2009-12"
"Burj Al Arab, ""The World's Most Luxurious Hotel""","This magnificent hotel, considered by many the best hotel in the world, is way beyond  the level of any other hotel I've been to. Since you get off your vehicle end enter the lobby, until the usually sad moment of your checkout, this hotel offers top quality services and accommodations.The people at the front desk,  the butlers, the private concierge in every floor, and all of the staff provide a friendly, yet professional service and attention. This combined with the two floor suite filled with complimentary boxes of Persian candy, Hermes toilet products for each guest, top quality spa products, and a huge variety of home entertainment, among many other things, give this hotel its 7 stars, and the fame and prestige it deserves.","5","2009-10"
"3rd Visit but this is a first...room TOO BIG!","OK it is a silly place but hey you only live once and Amex negotiated a huge discount with a bottle of wine, a couples massage, superb canapes, cocktails and fruit included. The room was on two floors with three bathrooms, two whirlpool baths, a kitchen, staff quarters a dining room and two huge sitting rooms. And a small office. And a dressing room. I'm sure there was more but I kept getting lost. I also helped myself to the free Hermes aftershaves, soaps, moiturisers etc. All 17 of them. Buying these would have come to more than we paid for the room!

As always faultless service and a real sense of being pampered. Should be on everyone's list of things to try before you die. Pool is small for a hotel of this calibre but I'm splitting hairs here and the pools in the hotel upstairs have an infinity view over the whole city","5","2009-11"
"Ultimate luxury","Everything about this hotel said ""money"" - an ultra luxury hotel with most attentive staff and fabulous surroundings.

From the moment we checked in until we were dropped off at the airport nothing was too much trouble. Yes, it is expensive, but well worth the money. I will let the pictures speak for themselves.

I highly recommend the skyview bar - excellent choice of wine and champagne and served exactly as it should be. 

We loved the hotel, however, as we are not used to having everything done for us it did get a little tiresome telling staff to leave us alone towards the end of the holiday as something as mundane as moving a sunbed was met with a ""please let me""!","5","2008-08"
"The best hotel in the world","It the most beautiful hotel i have stayed in , i was staying in the normal room , i paid almost 700 pounds for a room per night , but it was a totally worth it..
the best is the under water resturant which is there and the fountains in the entrances and the main starway , they are just beautiful , and the sky resturant is the nest place to be.
A MUST STAY ..","5","2008-03"
"Great Hotel, worth every pnny","We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and loved every minute of stay, was a great experience. The hotel is undoubtedly one of the best properties in the world, the service is excellent, the rooms are huge and the location is great. We stayed in their standard suite, that comprised of two floors, bedroom on the first and a TV and study and sitting area on ground.

The moment you arrive at the hotel you are greeted exceptionally well by their staff. They offer you the delicious dates and water. he staff is frendly and very accomodating to your needs. Usually you find staff at luxury hotels a bit snobbish but here you completely feel at ease. They say, 'we never say no to out guests for anythng' and rightly so.

Every floor has their dedicated concierge and room service attendant, that makes you feel pampered. They have a private beach which clean and very beautiful. They take you in golf cart around the hotel property.

Location and views from the hotel is amazing, its on the Jumeirah beach road (most up market area of Dubai) and opposite the hotel is another great structure by the same group. It is also close to the Mall of Emirates, which is one of the best malls in the city for shopping. 

All the guests in the hotel get free Hermes deodrant, perfume, shower gel, body lotion and the best is everything separate for men and women so you get two bottles each. We loved this thing about the hotel, otherwise you usually get tiny bottles.

The hotel is certainly expensive at about $2500 per night (and half the price in July being of-peak season), but you are going to feel pampered and feel the luxury at every moment in the hotel, from service to food to the room and property quality.

We are definitely going to stay in the hotel again. Definitely recommend it !!!!","5","2009-07"
"UAE-Burj al Arab","I found the story behind the building of the Burj Al Arab interesting as well as the architects motive for his design and how he was sucessfull.  A beautiful building in a fascinating city. Where else can you go sand boarding instead of snow boarding? Well if you like snow boarding, they have indoor ski resorts there:-)","5","2006-09"
"Everything perfect...","The Burj al Arab is FABULOUS.  I will never be able to say enough about this place and the people who work there and looked after us.  We just loved it and want to return one day.  The focus was on service and you get what you pay for.  The suite was awesome, the views spectacular over the Arabian Gulf, the butlers and other personnel attended to our every need and made us feel completely at ease.  The night time turn down service was a a great  experience (for me at least - I don't think my husband noticed, except I know he loves his Burj slippers and flip flops)  - I got chocolates one night, foot balm another, a Burj al Arab fan on another and then some la prarie face cream another night.  The bathroom was large and beautifully decorated, as was the whole place.  The toiletries were all Hermes and I just couldn't leave them when we left, even though they were full size bottles.  The room service is great - we had an absolute feast in our room and enjoyed every bit of it.  We loved Al Mahara  and Al Mantaha - Al Mahara was VERY special with the 'trip' on the sub to get to the restaurant.  The food at Al Mahara was divine - I can't stop thinking about the seafood platter I had there.  Breakfast was easy going and well-presented - there was a big selection to choose from in the various restaurants.  A buggy picked us up and took us to their private beach.  It was hot but the attendants brought us iced water and made sure we had an umbrella.  The water was so warm.  It was an unbelievable experience swimming and floating in the waves in the shelter of the beautiful Burj al Arab.  There is a swimming pool upstairs in the hotel (actually two pools I think - mixed and ladies only) and it was such a pleasure to swim there - once again the opulence was out of this world.  There is security at the front gate, so (I think) only those who have booked a tour or tea, or are lucky enough to be staying are admitted.  There was no awkwardness and no unexpected or unpleasant surprises.  It was pure luxury and pampering.  Absolute attention to detail.  We liked Dubai and our holiday experience there, and staying at the Burj al Arab was pure pleasure for us.","5","2009-09"
"Been there, done that!!","We stayed four nights at the burj. Truly incredible. The staff and the hotel (can I even call it a hotel?) leaves nothing out, and you pay for everything. The other reviews will tell you about all the great amenities so I will focus on those areas that I wish were in the other reviews. this review is for average joes, like us, who once again want to say “been there, done that.” Lastly, First, we are on a country count. We try not to visit the same country/destination twice. And while we will visit Dubai again as a springboard to other Middle Eastern destinations, we will not stay at the burj again, because it is a destination in and of itself.  FYI. Location is great and you can walk to the market/mall where there are plenty of restaurants.
Breakfast. Nice but average. No mimosas.  You would think for $1,500 /night, you could get complimentary Champaign.  However, the all you could eat filet was nice and similar to what you would get at LGs or The Cut.
Cigar Lounge. I am a cigar aficionado so this was one of the highlights. 
Ski Dubai—You have to do it. Not Vail or the alps but definitely a conversation piece.","5","2009-07"
"Unbelieveable!!","Stayed here for two nights on honeymoon.

From the moment you arrive and the moment we lleft we were treated like VIPS.  The rooms are amazing with every gadget you can imagine and amazing views of Dubai. The butlers are discreet, but will do anything for you.  Restaurants are expensive, but the food is unbelievably good.  Definately 7stars and if we hadn't already paid to stay at Atlantis The Palm for the next 3 days we would have stayed here for longer!","5","2009-06"
"We had a great time.","This is a very friendly hotel and nothing is too much trouble, the staff were fantastic and especially in the Aussie bar lol.
The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was nearly as big again.
The swimming pool was brilliant and it was like getting in the bath.
The lifeguard was continually cleaning and moving the sun beds back when they had been moved.
Breakfast was also good, with a variety of choice.
Could not fault this hotel, even though we have not scored it high for location, we had a car to get around, which was fun but you got used to it very quickly.","5","2009-10"
"Extraordinary experience","I did not think any hotel could exceed the expectations of my imagination, however this resort did.   It certainly is not inexpensive, but worth every penny.  Along with the break taking state-of-the-art facilities the service is second to none.  Our suite was two-stories and over 3600 sq feet; it was exquisitely appointed and had every luxury.   Once in the room, the entire suite can be controlled by in-wall touch pads or handheld touch screens:  this included curtains, opening the front door, lighting, sound, calling the butler, security/security cameras, etc.   The fitness center and indoor pool area was also a treat.   After a long massage I hit the cedar sauna and the menthol infused steam room – I was so relaxed I could barely make it to the room.  Later that evening we took advantage of the indoor infinity pool (beautiful!).  
One thing that really caught us off-guard was the fact that no matter what area we visited in the facility they addressed us by name.  It is still a mystery to us as to how they accomplished that, whether by technology or memorization we were still impressed and amazed!

The food in the hotel was very good, but not quite as impressive as the hotel facilities and service.  

If you truly want to be pampered and amazed I recommend going.  We are looking forward to our next visit (after we save up some money! Ha).","5","2009-10"
"Robots","The interior of the hotel is amazing, the view from the hotel is the best you'll see in Dubai (until the tower opens). 

Food - I have had better and I've had much more variety for the buffet in other 5 star hotels.

Service - Staff are very polite but lack 'personality', they are very robotic as if they have been programmed to give their specific answers, a little personality would go a long way ""

The hotel generally has a very cold feeling to it, I would class it as a good 5 star hotel, definitely not worth pay so much.","3","2009-11"
"Great experience, but be prepared to spend","To be clear, I did not stay overnight at the Burj Al Arab, but enjoyed a ""day trip"" package which included access to the private beach, access to the pool, a massage at the spa, and apetizers with drinks at Junsui, the hotel's Asian-inspired restaurant/lounge.  This cost about $300 for two people.
The pool was amazing. It has a magnificent view of the city.  The massage was short, but very nice. It left my skin feeling smooth and silky.
I don't have anything to complain about, except maybe the fact that although our phone confirmation through the concierge at our hotel (JW Marriott) said we would be able to go to the hotel starting at 9 in the morning, when the faxed confirmation was received it listed the time as 11 am.
The staff was very courteous and not snobby at all, despite the fact they knew we weren't regular guests.
Oh! And the food you can order by the pool was outrageously expensive. Most expensive slice of pizza I've ever had!","5","2009-06"
"A once in a lifetime experience","We went to Dubai specifically to stay in this hotel.  We were there to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.   From the moment we entered, we were made to feel like an honored guest;  we were seated in the lobby, and given dates and coffee while the checkin process took place.  We were escorted to our room, and a butler unpacked my wife's bags.  Every time we left the suite, we were greeted by friendly staff.  Every time we returned, we were greeted by friendly staff.   No wish would have been too much for them.   The suite itself was spacious and comfortable.   The bathroom was decadent, complete with immense shower, and jacuzzi tub.   It was a fabulous place to stay for 3 nights.   Is it worth $2000/night?  No;  but no place in the world is truly worth that expense.   Is it 5 star quality service?  Absolutely.   We have absolutely no complaints whatsoever about the service;  it was top-notch in every way.    Even though the expense is off the chart, I would have no qualms about returning and staying there again some day.   It was a tremendous experience.","5","2009-10"
"Burj Al Arab is unbelievable...","The most luxorious hotel I've ever stayed in.  It was truly amazing.  Unfortunately technology only goes so far.  For example, our ""does everything but make your coffee"" remote control lost battery power because we left it on the table and not back on the charger.  So no one could enter until we figured out how to turn off the ""Do Not Disturb"" lock manually (no easy feat!).  Also, the highly-touted butler service was inconsistent.  The butler on arrival offered to unpack our bags, iron our clothes and make our coffee in the morning.  But the morning butler refused to iron citing ""company policy"" and couldn't operate the in-room coffee machine.  So we stood in a decadent two-story $3000 a night suite ironing our own clothes, while our friends' butler did it all for them.  Overall good service but could be better.  The hotel itself?  Breathtaking.  At least once in a lifetime thing to do...","4","2009-10"
"Enjoy!","We have just returned from two great nights at the Burj at the end of our Dubai holiday. We had a two-bedroom suite for us and our two teenage boays, we were celebrating our elder son's eighteenth birthday.
I found the lobby,although it certainly has a ""wow""factor, a bit OTT and to be honest slightly tacky. The atrium of the Jin-Mao Tower in Shanghai is much more stylish! The staff were very attentive and courteous, but the service at breakfast was a bit excessive - it drives you mad after a while if someone folds your serviette every time you get up to get something from the buffet! 
However, these are small niggles and the overall experience was wonderful. The suite was really incredible with a super view and marvellous Hermès cosmetics. The beech was super, and the beach-bag and flip-flops supplied by the hotel were useful.The place is heaven for teenage boys who love every technical trick you can think of. Me, I had a hard time figuring ou the light switches and left the rest to the men! The butler was discreet and did not bother us unless we asked him for something, except to pop in every now and then with wonderful little refreshments.Go and try it if you love a bit of luxury!","5",
"Does exactly what it says on the tin!","We have been lucky enough to have stayed at the burj a few times and the hotel still impresses us. we were given complimentary roll royce transfers and upgraded to a panoramic suite as it was our wedding anniversary, early check in at 5 am so it was a good start, my wife was innundated with flowers daily, the breakfast is the best ive had any where in the world. the concierge and cleaning staff are very friendly and super efficient. we had a ball at the managers cocktail party in the royal suite, free champers and nibbles for a couple of hours. dinner in junsui is worth a look, well priced and a good atmosphere. ill be back next year, it gets better every time, you start to find other ways to get more value for money and just when you think the burj has reached its peak it finds another way to impress you.
they offer offer free spa treatments, limo to the malls, try the private beach, great service with a constant flow of smoothies. the pool staff are exceptional, namir and tag- well done again!
the burj touts itself as"" the most luxurious hotel in the world""
it might just be!
many thanks for another wonderful stay!","5","2009-08"
"Unsurpassed Luxury!!","Well..what can I say. An experience everyone should have once in a life time. In this wonderful hotel all the suites span 2 floors, the turndown service is outstanding with wonderful little treats left behind, complimentary Hermes bath products including perfume, personalised items for the children including sun packs colour coded for boys and girls. Wonderful restraunts especially Al Muntaha. Concierge on every floor, wonderful fruit everyday.
I booked this hotel for my husbands 40th birthday, the staff came in with a guitar and sang happy birthday before presenting him with a wonderful chocolate birthday cake...all complimentary..The spa on the 18th floor is sensational, the infinity pool also on this floor is wonderful with a ladies only side to the right and a mixed replica on the left hand side. The experience is one to be savoured and remembered. I will be going back in 2013 if not before. The children have a kids club on site, but sadly it does not compare to the one at the neighbouring Jumeirah Beach Hotel, but not to worry, the kids can use that one if they are staying at the Burj at no COST!!  A Truly Luxury Experience.","5","2007-02"
"For at least once in your life, this experience cannot be missed.","A couple of the reviews below will do a far-better review of the Burj Al-Arab. I was very impressed with the review below and what they described is perfect.. I had a very similar experience. 

The grandeur of the Burj must not be rivaled anywhere else. Everything was beyond my expectations. The service from the moment you walk into the door is nothing short of incredible. You are treated as though you are Arabian royalty yourself. The staff at the front of the bridge, checking names and room numbers, already make you feel like a V.I.P. as you cross the bridge to the lobby of the Burj. Surrounded by a fleet of Rolls-Royce's, and the occasional Ferrari or Maserati parked in the front, you know you have arrived at some place special.

I don't want to steal the wind from the previous reviewer, they describe the lobby and the fountain quite well. While the staff is checking you in, you are seated comfortably and already you have somebody waiting on you to make sure you're taken care of. Looking up into the atrium, it is quite an impressive sight to behold. The Burj is absolutely beautiful. The architecture inside and out is something that must be experienced in person to truly appreciate.

My suite far exceeded what I was expecting. After my butler opened the door to my suite for me, I walked in with amazement. Everything was bright, shiny, beautiful...and the panoramic view of the Gulf and Jumeriah Beach was just astonishing. At this moment, I truly felt the indulgence set in. Of course, this would have been a perfect trip for myself AND a significant other to enjoy (if I had one), I was traveling solo, and I almost didn't know what to do with myself in such a grand suite full of such splendor. 

The master bedroom upstairs was just as impressive. I had told the butler I just needed to relax for a little while before I determine what I was going to do that afternoon, and so he called for a couple of staff to come up to the bedroom and prepare the bed for me to sleep. Of course I had no intention of ""sleeping"", they prepared the room as such, putting out slippers, dimming the lights to the right level, and bringing in special pillows. It's these finer details that make this experience so incredible. 

I could go on and on...but the previous reviewers have described things so perfectly, I just wanted to add my little experience to the fold. I only stayed one night. It was one of the most fascinating and overwhelming nights of indulgence of my life. And I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.","5","2009-08"
"Pure elegance and absolute luxury","The Burj is still the most amazing looking hotel in amongst the skyline of new and upcoming buildings.  The Burj is very close to the Emirates Mall and well located to visit Butta Mall and the marina. Although the Burj stands alone, all the Jumeirah properties are connected and as a Burj guest you can visit any of the properties for any reason quite easily via buggy.  It is much easier that in previous years to move around the Jumeirah properties, but if you are not a guest of the Burj it is much harder to visit the Burj unless you have a reservation. Even as a guest your name and suite number is always checked before you enter the bridge to ensure that only guests get through.

We have stayed at the Burj numerous times, and each time our expectations are far exceeded. We arranged for a transfer which was absolutely faultless. As usual we were presented with a gleaming car readied with chilled bottled water, cold towels and I was presented with a beautiful bouquet of roses. The driver was very pleasant, ensuring that the AC was set nicely for us, and happy to let us listen to the radio instead of their selection of CDs.

Arriving at the Burj came with the usual grandeur of being able to by-pass the queue of traffic waiting to enter the bridge, and doorman fussing to help us out of the car. As usual we were met by the hotel front-of-house staff and presented with rose water, sweet dates and a cold towel, then whisked straight up to our suite. The lobby of the Burj never fails to impress with the colours of the floors graduating skywards, gentle music playing in background, and rhythmic patter of the fountain.

This time we stayed a panoramic suite. The finish of the suites are all of the same standard; really the only thing that differs is the size of the suite and the amazing floor to ceiling windows.

The solid wooden suite door opens onto a beautiful marble hallway leading to a study area and a stunning winding staircase to the bedroom.  The panoramic windows floods the suite with light and makes the room feel extremely big.  The entire suite is lavishly decorated with rich colours and lots of gold trim, beautifully matching the character of the hotel and the region. The living area comprises of many sofas and seating areas with a very large TV and entertainment system, a dinning area, a fully stocked bar area complete with bar stools.  The study area comes complete with laptop, printer and stationary all ready for use. In addition there is a wc and an extremely large under-stairs storage area.  The room control system has been updated and is much easier to use and there is now a Ipod sound system, which unfortunately is not integrated to the room’s speakers but is nice to have.

Upstairs there is a massive bathroom with his and hers sinks, a huge spa bath and massive shower! In addition full size Hermes products are also provided as well as an array of other useful things, such as toothbrushes, shaving kits, hair combs. The dressing area is well lit with large mirrors and ample wardrobe space. The bedroom is beautiful with amazing views. And at night, the turndown service leaves a little gift such as La Ric creams or yummy little chocolates.

The technology in the suite is pretty impressive with the TV remote controlling everything including the curtains and door access.  The updated system is much easier to use and much more responsive than the old system.  And the new Do Not Disturb system is much better now and actually does not allow the staff to override the system and enter the room, as it use to.  The TV does everything, including providing internet access and is a video entry system.

Unfortunately we did not have our usual butler, however, the three butlers that we did come across were perfectly polite and could not do enough to ensure that we were comfortable and enjoying our stay. Each floor also has a floor manager who works in tandem with the butler to ensure that your stay in going smoothly. All staff around the hotel seem to know your name and will always greet you with a smile. You can approach any one of them for any reason and the query/problem will always be sorted without any fuss. 

During this visit, my husband celebrated his birthday.  He had lovely surprise when our butler accompanied by two other butlers came into our room with a gorgeous chocolate cake and with one of the butlers playing the guitar, they sang happy birthday to him.  It was so lovely and especially thoughtful as we hadn’t mentioned that he would be celebrating his birthday during the stay.  Staff throughout the hotel randomly came up to him to wish a happy birthday too which added to the day.

The food at the Burj is still lovely! There are so many restaurants to choose from for any meal, but in particular we love the breakfast buffet at Bab al Yam by the pool; we tend to have lunch by the pool or on the beach - would highly recommend trying the wagu burger or seafood pizza at the pool or on the beach.  We also had dinner at Junsui which was a fantastic experience of making your own way round 12 cooking stations where they make everything including the sushi and sashimi in front of you!  Service was fantastic and discreet and the atmosphere relaxed.

Al Hambra at Al Qsar is also still extremely good, as is room service.  The menu selection is quite large and is always delicious.  In addition, every afternoon a selection of canapés were offered in our suite. 
 
As this hotel is a massive tourist attraction, early afternoons and evenings are busy in the hotel with people coming to visit. There are however lots of staff on hand to keep tourists away from guests, but it is a little annoying when you can’t get through the crowd posing for photos at the water fountain. However, once you get to the lift and up to your floor, tranquillity is quickly restored.

Overall this is an astonishing hotel and is still my absolute favourite of all those I have ever visited across the world. The hotel deserves its 7 star reputation. It provides absolute luxury, but in a relaxed way – the level of thought that goes into ensuring that we had the most perfect stay is amazing.  Staff beckon to your every call if you want them too, or they will simply leave you to enjoy yourself while working discreetly to add little indulgent touches to make your stay even more surprising and even better than the day before.  I would highly recommend a stay – everyone should enjoy this little piece of this luxury – at least once.","5","2009-08"
"Thee Best in the world - The TOP for service","I spent one week there and all was perfect, it is very hot at this periode but you have everything inside, baby sitter for my daughter they provided you mobile phone and everybody in the hotel took care of her, butler, reception and security on each floor, if something was wrong or you were not happy the general manager present excuses and bottle of champagne, I got free rolls royce to pick up me to airport, the room are very luxious and panoramic view, very expensive but if you can afford it you will never regreet it. Lot of choice for restaurants, room service is like a restaurant, they know your taste and learn about you and you always have complementary in your room like the fruit you like, newspapers, cakes, ect...everyday different.","5","2008-08"
"How could this possibly be worth the $$ - but it WAS!","Rumor has it this hotel would have to be fully booked for 400 years before paying for itself.  We are lucky this was built by such a wealthy system as we get to enjoy the splendor of it all.

When I first found out we were staying here (albeit only for one night) I was a bit nervous.  I read we would have 3 butlers and a suite larger than our first house.  What ever could I ask the butlers to do?  How could we possibly take full advantage of the room, the facilties and the location?  How could I make it worth spending this kind of money.

First I contacted the hotel to book a dinner for the one night we had there.  A birthday dinner. Then I read and gave up reading about the hotel.  I found noone to tell me what I could possibly use one let alone 3 butlers for.

So that is why I'm writing this.  Firstly, when you walk in there is no ""check in desk"" or ""reception"".  There is someone there with the best dates in the world.  You give your name, you sit at one of the couches and they bring you a COLD towel (awesome) and more dates.  Then your butler takes you up the escalator and you are IN.  In the hotel that you have to pay even to have a tour.  Your eyes simply can't take in all of the colors, details and fountains around you.  The butler has seen the look in your eyes before.  Many times.  They know to walk slowly.  They know to smile and explain that they are taking you up to your room.  They know to answer your questions slowly since your mind is on overload.  Actually all of your senses are on overload.

We go up to our room and inside there are two orange juices, a bottle of wine and a rose (along with other beautiful flowers) in the room.  We have our own office (with a printer, computer (yes they provide a laptop to use).  I have a video posted under ""Hakan's 50th birthday suite"" on youtube but think before you view it.  It is pretty wonderful to be surprised.

So what do you ask the butlers during your stay?  The cool thing is a lot of time you don't ask - they just provide.  When you approach your room they are already there with the key to open the door for you.  Before dinner time they bring in some canapes and offer some sparkling apple juice, etc.  The free wine that was in the room is definitely coming in handy as well.  

They confirm your dinner reservations.  They confirm your flights for you,  They provide you with extra towels (the minutes you leave your room they straighten, fix and freshen).  Every time.  

There were buggies that took us to the souk (not the cheap well known gold souk which you must also go to) but a nice new shopping mall kind of souk.

Since we were there in the summer we were able to check in early and since we had a gold card of some sort we were able to extend our check out until 6pm (our flight was at 9pm).  Even with a gold card we could not have done that in the busier season - one benefit for coming here during summer.

The pool was wonderful.  We went early in the morning (at least early for us) and had a great swim and layby before it got too hot.  We were brought ice water, towels, etc.

It is true that the Hermes in the room (full size cologne, perfumes, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc) is to take home.  At least we did.  What a wonderful memory to have at home.

The butler took us on a tour of the facilities (definitely ask him/her to do this - amazing).    My hubby asked to see the Presidential Suite.  A quick call later and we were in the ROYAL suite (Kings live far better than Presidents!).  Ask to see it.  Can't hurt to ask.  We videotaped the whole thing too.

The drinks upstairs are expensive.  about $25USD if I remember.  But it includes canapes to our surprise.  It turned out to be sort of worth it actually.   They do sell the most expensive drink in the world.  The Skyview Bar in the sailboat-shaped Burj Al Arab claims the Most Expensive Drink title for its “27.321” cocktail named for its price in Dubai currency and the bar’s location on the 27th floor. In dollars? $7,450.

So cheers everyone.  If you have the opportunity to go here DO!!!  

PS.  If you ski don't miss out on the SkiDubai.  Amazing.  Better than you think it would be.  We stayed three nights total in Dubai.  One on our arrival before traveling elsewhere in the Middle East and two on our return.  One before the Burj and than the Burj.  Worked great for us that way.  We stayed at the Sheraton Dubai Creek which was very nice.","5","2009-07"
"Great stay - a few tips","My wife and I spent three nights as part of our honeymoon. Everything is amazing, I won't spend time on room descriptions, but I will offer a few tips for people visiting the hotel. 

First of all, there's no need to use house cars - they're expensive and unnecessary. The hotel really pushed us to use their rolls royce phantoms to and from the airport, don't do it. Taxis are cheap in Dubai, and they seem to be mostly Lexus's. Use them to go to places like the gold sook, and have them wait for you, they're very reasonably priced.

Check the website to make sure the price you paid for the room hasn't gone down since you made the booking. We rebooked twice at better prices. We payed a little extra, and got a panoramic suite, this is probably unnecessary, stick with the one bedroom deluxe suite.

As everybody has mentioned, the restaurants are expensive. If you can get a package from the hotel that includes breakfast, do it. As a guideline - breakfast was a buffet - 250 AED per person  (app $70 US). So it's expensive, but it's fantastic. Breakfast is offered at two of the restaurants, Bab Al Yam – a more traditional North American style breakfast – i.e. fruits, breads, eggs, etc, or at Junsui – which has a selection of fruits (but not as impressive), but also has Asian themed foods, i.e. Dim Sum, Japanese items etc. The Bab Al Yam was more my style, but it was fun trying the Junsui breakfast the third morning. You can’t go wrong with either.  

The hotel offers something called the ""Culinary Flight."" If you're a foodie, I'd recommend it. Basically one course at each of the restaurants. If you're staying more than one night, do it the first night, it will give you an idea of which restaurants you'll want to go to the rest of the trip. We had lunch at Al Mahara – the seafood restaurant -  it was a nice meal, but nothing special, and far too expensive. I would strongly recommend Al Iwan, which is buffet style, but is spectacular. Drinks at the bar on the top floor are overpriced, but if you need to do it, go before the sun sets, so you at least have something of a view...

And if you’re feeling lazy, don’t hesitate about getting room service. Easily the best room service I’ve eaten. Go with the Indian food, and you won’t be disappointed.  

This is an amazing place - but obviously incredibly expensive. If you can afford it, great, but if it's out of your price range,  I'd recommend doing a lunch at Al Iwan - I really thought it was a special restaurant.","5","2009-07"
"A beautiful stay... highly recommended","Our 3 night stay was just perfect.  As others have stated the rooms are amazing, amenities first class and service for us was as desired - i.e. not too over the top.

The breakfast was though only average in our opinion with a limited selection.  The pool is small but the private beach lovely.

If you're heading to Dubai a night or two night stay is a must, simply to wake up with a mirror on the ceiling is an experience in itself! Remember though Gents need a jacket to dine in many of the restaurants!","5","2008-07"
"Fabulous Honeymoon experience","Thoroughly enjoyed 5 amazing nights in this spectacular hotel during the last part of our honeymoon. From the moment we arrived we were treat like we were the most important people in the hotel. We were collected and driven by one of their white Rolls Royce, then had a line of people waiting to greet us and offer us various nibbles and refreshments. We did the wild wadi park and dune desert driving experience (that was really good fun!) The spa treatments at the Burj were the best i have ever had.The food we ate, from £100 for a steak, to lunches at the beach restuarant were all fabulous and well worth the expense. The staff were incredibly friendly and couldnt do enough for us. What we really liked about this hotel though was the lack of pretentiousness.  It had the most relaxing & welcoming feel to it, much more than any other hotel i have stayed in. On an evening they had a string quartet playing while you could sit relaxing/drinking and enjoy the fabulous water fountain & lighting displays etc . On our last night they were able to light the fire display outside (as it had previously been quite windy) which was just great to watch! (Also on our last night, our butler packed up our suitcases for us so we could spend our last evening enjoying ourselves - i had never seen my clothes folded so neatly!!) There would always be a Lamborghini, Porsch etc (along with the rolls royces) pulling up at the entrance, which was fun, the hotel is very bling bling!  But for a fab & fun experience where you are looked after so well and made to feel so special on your honeymoon, you couldnt ask for anything better, would highly recommend it!","5","2006-06"
"Stunning!","We had the best of times at this hotel. We only stayed for two nights but we made the most of it. We went with friends for a special Birthday... Some of the reviews before we went were poor but I have nothing bad to say about this hotel it was GREAT! The staff were fantastic - people previously hinted that if you weren't an 'A Lister' then you wouldn't receive the specail treatment! Not the case... There were celebs there but we got the best table in the restaurant upstairs and the staff made such as fuss on our Birthday evening....Great 'Cosmo' Cocktails and Gorgeous Birthday cakes! It was marvellous.... A great experience for a special event!","5","2007-05"
"over the top","The Burj was over the top in every way imaginable, but worth staying there just for the experience of it.  Service is wonderful, the rooms are luxurious (although gaudy), and the hotel restaurants are top notch.  We were only here for a few days en route to another destination, and I'm not sure I would have wanted to stay longer, but for a few days, enjoying the craziness that is the opulent, indulgent Burj was a lot of fun!","5","2008-09"
"Second time just as good as the first!","This was our second weekend at the Burj - the last was in 2005. I was very happy to find that the hotel had lost none of the wow factor of our first stay. The service was top class and the ""rooms"" (if you can call these house sized spaces rooms) are simply outstanding. We arrived at 6am and our suite was ready and we requested a late (4pm) check out which was no problem. Breakfast and taxes were included in our rate which made the final bill slightly less painful! Expensive, yes but worth it? Definitely!!","5","2009-07"
"Jaw Dropping!","Well what can I say.... AMAZING ROOM, AMAZING SERVICE!

Just chilling by the poolside bar was lovely, dont forget to visit wild wadi water ark and book the Hummer desert trip its CRRRAAAZYYYY.

The only slight problem was that the virtual submarine ride was broken to the fish restaurant and we were not that impressed with the food.

However the Al Iwan was the best food I have EVER eaten...

Thank you to the hotel staff

p.s.  ITS DAMN EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY!","5","2009-07"
"Not seven but clos to six stars","Room is spacious and elegant. Carpet had a rather large dirty patch close to the chaiselongue. No large twin beds in the panorama suite but just a rather soft king size bed. Why don’t you offer two queen beds? One mattress is good for part-time. Not all your married clients like to sleep on the same mattress full-time. It would be difficult if I would travel with a son or a sister. 
Butler service is not that good. Used glasses and food leftovers are not removed when clients left their rooms. Flight reconfirmation could not be delegated to the butler. Room service was asked for when we left for breakfast. It came only at lunch time when we were in the room. This is not acceptable.
Food is very good but not outstanding, e.g. comparable to three Michelin star kitchens as they are available in Atlantis Hotel for example. Culinary flight is a good offer – the wakyu dish at Al Mahara was excellent. The seafood menu at Al Mahara was very good, too.
Internet access was not possible twice. The first time I had to wait several hours for repair. There was no radio in the room with classical music, for example. MTV in TV is certainly not our choice!
Everything was more or less excellent, i.e. close to six star (6-)","5","2009-03"
"Wonderful Hotel, True Luxury","Luxury, Decadence, Wow !!   I spent four nights at the Burj in March with my wife for my 40th. It really was an amazing holiday and we will definately go there again sometime soon. We are lucky enough to only ever travel 5 star and this hotel is head and shoulders above the vast majority we have stayed in around the world. 

The staff were very attentive and nothing was too much for them. The rooms are really huge and spotlessly clean, the gym is state of the art with great sea views from the tread mills and the Spa is fantastic. The free golf carts to the beach and other local hotels are very handy as there are many restaurants nearby. Eating in the Burj is very expensive but first class, especially in the restaurant with the massive fish tank.. For a special treat it is well worth the money as you will have memories to look back on which are priceless. A unique hotel !","5","2009-03"
"wonderful birthday treat out of this world","We were staying in Dubai for 3 nights en route to Malaysia and as it was my birthday decided to spend a night at the Burj.
From arriving at the door of the hotel the experience was WOW. As we we waited for our suite we were greeted by staff with friendly smiles and made to feel very special.
The suite was fantastic, there was a want for nothing . They have thought of everything and the v iew was stunning.
As it was my birthday that day the general manager ordered flowers, tapas and birthday cake to our room with a personalised card. It was a lovely surprise. And the butlers were only too happy to let me pose for a phot with them!
We ate at Al Muntaha restaurant and were given a table again with a beautiful view. I must say that it was the most expensive meal I have ever had in my life and perhaps a bit too pricey but we knew that before we went.
We were not getting picked up until 11pm the next night and this did not present a problem as were given a late check out and still allowed to use all the facilities which I did. The spa is beautiful and sunbathing by the pool is an experience in itself ,everthing is done for you .
I can truly say that the staff were wonderful and at no time did I encounter snobbery of any kind.
As in previous posts yes it is expensive but if you want a once in a lifetime experience then I would recomend it to everyone. ( My husband is now saying he would like a second visit! I will just need to stop buying shoes!!)","5","2009-05"
"Wow","Like many other reviewers we wanted to stay one night at the BAA as a once in a lifetime experience. But from the moment we checked in we knew that we had to come back. The hotel is extremely expensive, but it is worth every penny (maybe except for the restaurants which are a bit too pricy).  The suites are amazing and the service is outstanding. If you think you can afford it - try it!","5","2009-03"
"Fabulous...top class!","We have been very fortunate to have been able to have enjoyed many holidays here with our children, I was unsure about staying here the very first time my husband booked it as there was so much hype about it I expected it to be filled with snooty people.  However we didn’t encounter anyone like that, the same could not be said for its sister hotel the Jumeriah Beach!  The staff are so lovely, we have never found them to be overbearing and there wasn’t a big turn over of staff, year after year we went back to see the same friendly faces moving up through the ranks.  It’s a nice touch to be remembered.

Lots of the reviews I have read have seemed to be from people who had not stayed and had perhaps just eaten in the hotel, my families experience has always been superb, and the breakfast is an experience…fillet steak?!  I will definitely go back sometime in the future as there is something special about this hotel and of course the privacy such a resort gives you is a real treat.

The water park adjacent to both the Burj and Jumeriah is fantastic and that is probably what our children enjoyed the most, they could come and go as they pleased and we never worried about their safety at all, the hoped on one of the many beach buggy’s and got ferried all over!

If you hunt around and book flights separately you can get a really good deal, when the children where younger they the four of us stayed in one of the fantastic rooms, one on the fold out sofa and another on a fold out bed which we paid a little more for however on our last trip as they were older we had to have two so perhaps next time we will go alone!!","5","2007-08"

"The Wonderful Burj Al Arab.","To celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary in Dubai we decided to spend our first two nights at the Burj Al Arab.  On recent visits to Dubai we have always stayed at the Al Qasr which has been one of our most favourite hotels, so as this was a special occasion we decided to book the Burj.

Well all I can say is, we had the best holiday we have ever had and the Burj made our Anniversary absolutely wonderful and so special.

We arranged a Rolls Royce to pick us up and this started our holiday in style, we were treated like Royalty from start to finish.

When we arrived we were greeted with cold towels and dates and taken to our Suite, it was fantastic, we could not believe it.

The whole hotel is amazing and the staff can not do enough for you.

There were many treats throughout out stay and this just made the whole experience out of this world.

Our Anniversary Cake and Flowers were just gorgeous and brought tears to my eyes.

There were a few things I would have changed, but I am not even going to mention them as the highs well exceeded any little niggles.

My husband summed it up completely when he said “there is a serenity about the Burj” and this was exactly right.

Burj Al Arab thank you so much for everything, we will definitely be back please keep our room warm for us….","5","2009-05"
"SERVICE TOO ""OVERPOWERING "" !","My husband and i stayed at this hotel as our final ""treat"" on our last leg of our honeymoon in Thailand before heading home.
The hotel is extremely opulent and grand, and was what we had expected after reading all the other reviews on it.

We were completely gobsmacked at our suite !!  It was massive and fabulous and luxurious and decorated beautifully. we have never stayed in a hotel ""room"" thats as big as our own house !!

The one thing that we were'nt happy with, was the fact that the service, was ""too much"", im sure some people enjoy this type of service but we didnt appreciate the turn down service at 10.30pm when 3 memebers of staff turned up to make up the bed, tidy up and do the hoovering !!!   why did the room need hoovered at that time of night after it had been done in the morning and nobody been in it all day to make a mess !! It just didnt make sense and seemed a bit intrusive to us (especially on our honeymoon !)

The prices in this hotel are really for people who have enough money to not think about what they are paying for, and sadly this wasn't the case for us, so £10 for a bottle of evian water and £7 for a can of diet coke out of the minibar was a liitle bit out of our pricerange to say the least !!

Saying that though the hotel itself is just beautiful, and in a lovely location, with fantastic views from all the floor to ceiling windows in our suite (13th fllor) across the marina and the beach.
It was definitely an experience staying here, but we have to admit for us personally we wouldnt return as we felt that the service was for ""show"" and not neccessarily for the best of the customers, and after staying in hotels in Bangkok and Koh samui where the staff would do everything for you without being intrusive we would prefer to return there than here again.
It felt as if the staff were nice to you because they were being paid to do so and not because they actually wanted to or enjoyed doing so, which is a real shame for such an amazing beautiful opulent place, but maybe thats how it got to be rated as the only 7 star hotel in the world !
It has to be expereinced though once in your lifetime even if its only to say you stayed there !

I have to say though the beds here are the comfiest we have slept in EVER !!!!!","4","2009-03"
"love the interior","very very impressive hotel made in desert with all newly listed facilities and latest decorative pieces in each and every corners. mind blowing fountains in entrance . excellent hospitality and very very co operative staff . pool side is worth seeing and if you go in upper area by lift ,you can find your self in heaven -- ocean surrounding you n tempting view.rooms were nice but little bit small but if you take view from outside your room , it looks like big cruise mine was ocean view room and i never like to miss any moment .i really appriciate that they do serve breakfast in small silver vessle in proper quantity with best quality and too amny  different items . their serving style is praise worthy. their style of spreading bedsheet is different n i love that.cleanliness of all glasses of windows --- i cant explain","5","2008-10"
"there is not another hotel like it","this is our favourite hotel of all and having stayed in a number of other in Dubai we keep going back.

It is an A list hotel for Very rich people, so If you have the money it is a great way to spend money and if you dont then find a cheaper place. I will give this place 20/20. It is the true definition of perfection. Polite and helpful staff,Buttlers are excellent, True 7 star. I stayed there for 3 weeks and it was well worth the dollar. I will definately go back there when next I am in Dubai.","5",
"Pure Luxury","We stayed at the Burj after spending a week at the Dar Al Masyf villas at the Al Qsar hotel complex.  We were lucky enough to be upgraded at the Burj to a 3 bedroom diplomat suite.  All I can say is that it was sheer luxury through and through.  We were treated like royalty throughout our stay. The Butler kept arriving at the door with small treats for us to sample and we ate at both the rooftop restaurant and the lower seafood restaurant. Very expensive as alcohol is extortianately priced.  The beach was great superb beach attendants and a treat to have no children as there was at the previous beach. I can't wait to return.","5",
"Loved the view from the rooms and the restaurant","When I saw the hotel from outside, I could not believe that such a beautiful piece of architecture could be man made. The hotel sits on its artificial island and the view from there back to the beach is amazing. Surprisingly, at the reception in the hotel, I didn't find the staff too helpful but the service that was provided was simply amazing. I had a fleet of people to help me with everything that i needed in the room from a pillow of my choice from the menu to a bar. The room I stayed in overlooked the manmade islands which was just being made at that time. 

The stay and the restaurants are very expensive but if your willing to pamper yourself a lot this is the place to be.","5","2006-05"
"Not all that ist cracked out to be..","Its an amazing hotel, no doubt about it, but it came short of my expectations, probably beacause og the hype around it. However, very clean, roomy, pleasant suites, private, quiet and nice athmosphere. Excellent food! Spa was also good :) Staff was always doing their best to please guest.

A very nice, but (too) expensive experience.
PS. bring sunglasses, cause all that gold will blind you.","4","2006-09"
"One of those things you just have to experience","I was treated to a week here with my mum. It is quite simply pure luxury & life at the Burj is effortless. You are treated like royalty from the moment you step inside. The rooms are magnificent, the setting is stunning and the service incredible. One tip - check before you arrive that your window is not obscured by one of the three architectural metal bars that form part of the building as they can spoil the view. The rooms are fantastically equipped - you don't need to take toiletries as you are supplied with full-sized bottles of Hermes stuff, razor kit, toothpast & toothbrush, cotton wool, moisturiser etc. Rooms also have internet connected laptop ( all free).","5","2009-03"
"Incredible opulence, worth every penny","Dubai was a stopoff point on the way to the Maldives for our honeymoon, so we thought we would see what all the fuss was about at the Burj Al Arab for 3 nights.

I was worried that the hotel was going to be a huge letdown, but not at all. It was fantastic from start to finish and in every way.  We arrived around 10:00 and our deluxe suite on the 7th Floor was already available.  The deluxe suites are the most ""basic"" room types available, but this was still luxury beyond anything I could imagine. We had incredible views over the gulf waters from the main room and the upstairs bedroom.   The butler and floor manager and incredibly receptive, and I don't think I had to open the door myself once on returning to my room as they always got there ahead of me.  There is a good laptop with broadband in the rooms, and technology has generally been used to the full - a touchscreen controls the TV, call to butler, curtains etc.  

The bathroom is excellent - his and hers basins, large jacuzzi bath, shower with multiple jets.  In addition, they provide incredible toiletries - all Terre D'Hermes,  and utensils - e.g. Gillette Mach 3 Razor.

Bedroom is huge and comfortable, and would be fine as the hotel room in its entirety - you have a choice of mattress type and pillow type.

Suite overall is comfortably better than any flat I have lived in!

The spa on the 18th floor is lovely. The mixed pool is an infinity pool overlooking Dubai; really nice at night.

Breakfast buffet was included, and was good standard.

Finally, the Wild Wadi water park is a very close walking distance (5 minutes)  to the hotel and is free to anyone staying there.  This was great fun, and I recommend guests at the hotel should visit here for a day!

Overall, I recommend everyone, within reason, should stay here. They won't regret it!","5","2009-03"
"Our second time around We like be treated like a King and Queen","Okay,Okay we are neither a King or a Queen,but for one night and a high limit credit card we were. We stayed here back in 2006 and enjoyed the place so much we thought we would splurge again.SO $1800 later we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite. Again you are just in awe of the place driving up to it and finding a local taxi driver to do it is easy as they don't get many chances to go there. We were on the 18th floor this time and were greeted by concierge by name and remembering what we liked last time. We spent the night at the races and returned to our beautiful hotel and had dinner at the buffet in th lobby.Didn't think that was worth the $250 price tag. Breakfast out back the next morning was only $50 and had filet on the buffet. Had a Corona up in the bar $50. You are not getting away cheap here. We thought the room was showing some age this time as there was a wear spot on the des chair and all of the shower head sprayers were not working. Piddly stuff but again it's $1800 a night. Hard to sleep here when there is so much to check out and being of humble living back home we were like kids in a candy shop. We were not excited about the mirror over the bed but later found out that you can have it covered.There was not a diet Pepsi in the hotel but was assured that our next stay there will be some.Fun place to stay but very expensive.Lots of memories. The Burg is Dubia.","5","2008-01"
"Treated like Royalty from check in to check out","I had the pleasure of staying here in September 2008. It was an amazing experience. Expensive but worth every penny. The room was an absoluting beautiful. It was 1850 sq ft with two floors and spiral stair case. His and hers sinks in the bathroom. A jacuzzi for two. Steam shower. The view of the Sea was stunning. 24 hour butler who tidied up the minute u left the room.  They gave u full size Hermes fragrances, shampoos, body lotion, aftershave....etc. Lots of other free toiletries to take home like La Prairie's Caviar cream.  There is a business center with laptop, fax and printer in each room. Nice swimming pool but who needs that when there is a private beach!

I thought the food at the restaurants wasn't the best. It wasn't bad but I just expected better tasting food considering everything else about this hotel was top notch.

I definately recommend this hotel to everyone. I know its expensive and not everyone can afford to stay here. Its totally worth saving for to have a once in a lifetime experience.","5","2008-09"
"wow wow wow","everyone should stay here once in a lifetime.  it was the most incredible experience.  expensive but worth every penny.  service to die for.  press a clicker, the butler draws your bath.  hermes amenities, staff wonderful.  there is nothing more one could ask for","5","2009-03"
"To stay or not to stay...","We'd bought our flights months ago for a long weekend in Dubai, but a couple of weeks before we were due to fly and we still hadn't booked our accommodation.  The reason?  The Burj Al Arab.  With enough money to consider the idea of staying there, but not so much that we are able to squander it without much thought, we were in a dilemma.  Could we really justify spending That. Much. Money?
We decided to spend one night in the Burj and two nights nearer the center of Dubai (separate review).

And to summarise before the details - the Burj was more amazing that I had imagined.  It absolutely made our holiday and I'm now trying to work out when I can save up enough money to justify going back, for longer!  

As the Burj Al Arab is quite away out of the center of Dubai we decided to only spend one night there as we didn't want to waste a lot of the weekend travelling in and out of town - this was our first visit to Dubai and we wanted to see as much as possible.  
Landing in Dubai early in the morning we'd pre-arranged an airport-to-hotel transfer with BA to minimise any hassle.  We got to the Burj around 10am. 
We were greeted as we walked into the foyer and were sat down while they took our details and passports.  Someone brought us cold wet faceclothes (blissful given the heat coming in through the window), some coffee (served in a mini cup but I think with as many top ups as you'd like), and a plate of dates.  They kind of stood over us though while we sipped our coffee and tasted the dates which felt a little bit awkward.  Although knowing us, they'd probably asked us something and were looking at us expectantly but we hadn't heard.  You can't see much of the hotel from these first few metres of the entrance foyer and what you can see is a bit disappointing.  Dull gold, dull red and a bit worn.

That changes as soon as you step onto the escalators to go up into the main foyer.  You can see all the way up the hotel, to all the different floors, as the inside of the Burj is hollow.  I hadn't realised.  It's light, and airy, and really colourful.

We were really lucky as a room was available for us straight away.  They took us up to our room (10th floor but as each room is two floors high it's further up than it sounds) to do the check-in - although in hindsight they probably realised their mistake in doing that as they struggled to get our attention back as soon as they opened the door.  We'd gone for the panoramic suite and were greeted with two storey high floor-to-ceiling windows and a blue and gold staircase sweeping up to the right.  We figure the suite was about 2-3 times the size of our two bedroom flat.  The pictures on the website don't do it justice and I just don't have the vocabulary or writing skill to help out much.  The word that comes to mind is opulent, and all the others associated with it in a thesaurus.  I'd heard that the Burj is actually a 5* hotel and the 7* rating is just clever marketing.  I don't know if this is true, but if it is, after seeing this hotel, I think the 1 - 5 star rating system needs to be changed as this hotel is way above any 5* I've ever stayed in.
There are stickers on the windows to let you know that any window cleaners that might pass can not see into the room.  Although I'm not sure how true that is if the lights are on?!

As you will have read in other reviews, there are lots of complementary goodies in the room.  Obviously we'd paid for them in the rate, but there was more than I'd even expected.  His and hers shower gel, his and hers shampoos, his and hers deodorants, his and hers scent.  And when I say 'his and hers' I don't mean one shared bottle with a smell to suit male and female, I mean one bottle for him and one bottle for her.  Full size.  Hermes.  
Slippers, Flip flops, Beach Bag, box of stuffed dates (the most gorgeous dates I've ever tasted), and even a bottle of wine.
Be careful that you don't help yourself to the non-free items though - prices for those are in the mini bar menu.
    
We found the pillows (I guess they're not expecting people to go to bed at 11am but we were still tired from the flight) and had a nap for an hour before heading out to the Wild Wadi waterpark, a few minutes walk from the hotel and free to guests.  You get free towels from the park as a guest of the hotel but you have to pay for a locker (~£5 per locker).
I'm glad we went to the park, but it wasn't really that great and I would have been gutted if we'd paid extra to go in.  The slow moving river, where you sit on or cling to a rubber ring and float around is a bit boring.  The fast chutes, where you sit on a rubber ring and are pushed around by water jets are actually a bit painfull on your rear!  The wave pool is ok I suppose and there are sun loungers around it but not worth visiting the waterpark just for that when the beach is not far away.  And I expect that the newer waterparks in Dubai have improved upon it.

We headed back to the Burj to use the gym (about 4 of each cardio machine, free weights and various weights machines) and the spa pools (female only pools in the ladies changing rooms, and combined male / female pools near the mens changing rooms).  Windows overlooking the water (the pools and the gym, not the changing rooms). Very.  Nice.  Indeed.

As we'd messed up our eating clocks on the flight we weren't hungry for lunch but would be too hungry if we waited for dinner, so we decided to have afternoon tea instead.  We ordered it to our room so that we could loaf around in our dressing gowns to eat.  It was huge.  Mini buns, finger sandwiches, cakes and scones.  I think there might have been 8 scones.  It was delicious but we couldn't finish it.   

When we gathered the willpower to move again we got dressed and went up to the skybar for a couple of drinks.  It's a nice bar, but it's nothing really to rave about.  The drinks are quite expensive, though that wasn't really a surprise, and it was fine for a few glasses.

We had a choice of two restaurants for breakfast (included in our rates) - we chose the one on the ground floor with lovely views of the outdoor pool.  There was so much choice.  If you get the chance, try the honeycomb!

I guess if you have to choose between one night in the Burj Al Arab, or a luxury all inclusive week somewhere else, then you're probably better off going with the other option.  But if this is something you want to experience, and you don't mind spending that much money, and you want never to look at another hotel in the same way again, and you want to spend the next age rejigging your budget so that you can go back, then what are you waiting for!  Go and book it!","5","2009-02"
"Thanks for the memories","I recently had a two night stay at the Burj Al Arab (BAA) and was thoroughly impressed.  Though I agree with other reviewers that perhaps this was just a one time visit to try it and move on.  My greatest fear was that I would expect too much, and I think I walked away more satisfied than anything, with very few disappointments.

My friend and I determined to book at the BAA based on it’s reputation—seeing it non-stop on television travel programs.  I booked a two night stay on the hotel’s website for two nights, all-in a Panoramic Suite for 8100Dhms (roughly $3kUSD).  We arrived early at the hotel and check-in was a delight.  No front desk, no lines.  Simply sit in the lobby, enjoy juices, dates and hot towels, as a guest service rep met us to check-in.  Despite checking in early, where most hotels make it problematic, the BAA offered three options.  First offer was an upgraded suite.  Next they offered a different suite with an added bed.  Or, simply wait for the originally reserved suite to become available.  Thankfully we took the upgrade, which ended up retailing at 12000Dhms/night.

The suite itself was nothing short of amazing.  It redefines any hotel’s notion of a suite.  I refer to it more as a mini-mansion.  I was thoroughly impressed with the half hour tour of all the inner workings of the suite from our butler.  The suite featured one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on, and one of the finest showers I’ve ever stepped into.  Simply amazing.  The technology added to the room’s lightning, temperature, security and other controls is second to none.  I was impressed to have in-room wired or wifi internet, with the additional use of a computer printer.  Though shocked they did not offer high definition television, despite having HD lcd monitors.

The butler staff kept the room well stocked with fresh flowers, fruits and still water.  The moment you leave the room, the staff is in there cleaning it and prepping for your return.

I couldn’t get confirmation, but the smell and taste of the regular tap water indicated to me that the hotel possibly treats their water further after receiving it from Dubai’s desalination plant.  Water which had a noticeable bad taste at other hotels in Dubai.  

One great aspect of the suite at the Burj Al Arab is the scent.  They’ve managed to give the room a very neutral scent.  No overpowering fragrances. 

The only problem encountered during the stay was with the concierge service.  Twice they managed to mess up boating reservations at the Jumeirah Beach resort’s marina.  Our butler service tried to cover for them, but the damage had already been done.  Two days of boating were ruined.

Otherwise the concierge and butler were very thorough in arranging for any other needs throughout the stay--especially when it came to transportation.  The hotel operates their own car service which is comparable, if not more affordable, than one of the local taxis.  BAA extensively promotes their high end luxury vehicles, but they also had a fleet of more low key, unmarked vehicles which were great to take around town without causing unneeded attention.

Being that the hotel has become the national symbol for the UAE, they tend to draw a lot of amateur photographers and tourists at the gates.  Security was very good about keeping a guest list at the motor gate and foot gate, and keeping the hotel free from many gawkers.  They really offered a quiet, enjoyable hotel experience without having to navigate a lobby full of non-guest tourists.

I would definitely like to return, but quite honestly don’t see value for the dollar for the price paid.  It’s wonderful to try it, and maybe return years down the road, but I definitely won’t make this my first choice.  Especially as Dubai begins to open even more first class luxury hotel offerings as it grows.  I left with some amazing photos, and wonderful memories.","4","2008-12"
"From a different world!","We stayed for three nights in a panoramic suite, on the 12th floor of the Burj Al Arab.
Check-in was efficient, then we were welcomed in our suite by out personal butler, which did a perfect service during our wholhe stay.

The suite is big, very big. And I recommend a panoramic suite, because of the excellent view you get. All the amenities are available in the suite and the entertainment system is probably the best you can get. (e.g. when somebody rings the door bell you even see the video on the big flat screen tv inside the suite!)

Food was good, we ate at the steak house in the Jumeirah Beach hotel and also in the Al Mahara ""underwater"" restaurant. This experience was fascinating but also a bit frustrating. The setting is spectacular, although it is not underwater (just one big aquarium), the food on the other hand was a bit disappointing. We had a whole fish in a salt crust. They prepared it in front of us, served it on two cold plates and by the time the second plate was ready, my small piece of fish was already cold. And the fish was not cheap. Maybe they got better now, as they call themselves one of the top ten restaurants worldwide!

Otherwise the ""Burj Experience"" was great fun, decadence anywhere you look. On the beach we were served Evian water sprays.... 

Stay here if you need to have seen it. In summer you can afford it....","4","2006-07"
"Worth the $$","Yes, it's a lot of money.  However, it's one of those things that you just have to do it once in your life time.  Of course going in, we knew that Burj had exceptional service, but they were defintely a few notches above most hotels. 

During our butler's ""orientation"", he mentioned that they could change the mattress if it was too soft/hard.  Taking up the offer, we made the request.  When we came back from dinner that night, the mattress had been replaced.   

We had late check out as our flight was at mid-night.  Even after the check out, we could still use all the amenities of the hotel.  We kept a change of clothing in the locker room and went about exploring the city.  After dinner, we were able to use the pool and shower before we head out to the airport.  

I had a facial at the Spa.  It was good but not outstanding.  The lady behind the counter at the Spa (Qi/Qian?) was less than helpful when I was trying to make the appoitment and looked impatient.  Also, you could hear people talking in the hallway outside the treatment rooms, which could be slightly irritating when you try to relax.

Defintely try Junsui ( the new Asian restaurant) if you have the opportunity.  The Wagyu beef was absolutely delicious.  MMMMM...","5","2008-11"
"They say 7 star but this wonderful hotel misses the spot","The concept and suites are wonderful, you have to be amazed by the grandeur of this hotel. Like other travelers we found the pool wonderful. the Al Mahara restaurant the food was first class but total overpriced with a glass of wine being GBP30 or 150 Dirham, the Friday brunch was a joke at GBP96 or 495 Dirham the cavier bar only served lump fish & Salmon roe, main dishes where rather dull, we saw most of the desserts going back half eaten and I followed the trend and returned most of mine uneaten. The services throughout the hotel is perfect and i was amazed that all the staff knew our name. The fact that they charge to allow visitors all over the hotel makes you feel like you are in a goldfish bowl and i agree with other visitors that this is very annoying when you have paid so much to stay here. All in all we enjoyed our stay but like most other people would not return to this hotel. Dubai has so many very good hotels and go to any of the golf clubs for a better Friday Brunch.","3","2008-12"
"Value for money ?","The 7* is self styled, although it has won several awards, a 7* category doesn't exist anywhere except in its promotional literature and PR.

The 5* standard of most Hotels in Dubai is 'better' than many other hotels that are ranked as 5* elsewhere in the world anyway. 

Is it 50% - 100% better than the rest - that is almost impossible for anyone to quantify as it most surely is a matter of personal opinion.

The restaurants are over priced and there is better food to be had elsewhere in Dubai. So my advice if you do choose to stay there is to eat elsewhere.

If you feel that you will be disappointed or that your expectations would be let down then stay somewhere else.

Perhaps best summed up by saying that as long as I could afford to stay in the Burj for at least one night when I visit Dubai then I would. It is without doubt the best overall hotel proposition that I have ever experienced. And it gets better each time.

Is it value ? Questionable and depends on your definition of value. 

Did I do a sharp intake of breath as I paid the bill this year - yes, I did. 

Did I come away this year thinking it wasn't value for money - no, I didn't.

I will always remember the moment I surprised my best friend with our first one night stay in the Burj in 2006 - that memory is priceless regardless of cost. Her mum had recently passed away and I wanted to give her something beautiful that I knew she would always remember in what otherwise would have been a crap year.

Taking my sister there as a treat in 2007, when she had split up with her partner of 15 years and was in desperate need of some self esteem boosting 'guess where I've been and you haven't' news to tell.

Staying there this year has been a mixture of scrimping and saving, paying off credit card debt etc BUT being able to share it with friends has been the biggest part of it for me.

How do you put into words the 'value' of that? 

Or the value of being greeted by name by staff you have never seen before.

Or sitting down to breakfast on our first day this year to find a waiter that you've never seen before holding 'the jam you like so much Ms xxxxxx' when you've not eaten breakfast there for over a year.  Wild Blueberry and Cardamon jam by the way - not your run of the mill strawberry, although you can get that too.

Or 'we remembered that your sister liked strawberries, so we've put some in the fridge for her'

Or when the butler, on finding out that I was married but had left my husband at home to go on my annual girls holiday, brought a complete set of Hermes Terre Homme toiletries to the suite to say 'these are for your husband, please bring him to meet us too next time'

So do I go with high expectations - yes.

Have I ever been disappointed - no.

Do I pay too much - probably. 

You only have to read the hotel reviews below mine to see that people go with very high expectations and people mark the Burj down because they found crumbs on the carpet or because the butler didn't walk them to the lift.

If you look for faults because you've paid top dollar then I'm sure you will find them.

If you go for the overall experience and thank whichever God you pray to that you can stay afford to stay there and share it with friends - then maybe there won’t be any faults to find.","5","2008-11"
"absolute oppulance","We only stayed at the Burj for 3 nights and it all went too quickly.
From the moment you step inside you feel special and in total luxury.  The staff are very attentive but not in the way.  The public areas are amazing especially the water features.  The suites are like something out of hollywood and are huge.  Everything you need is there, you don't really need to leave your suite, everything in suite is operated by a remote control,curtains,and even the front door.  If you're missing everyone at home there is a laptop with internet at no extra charge.  The butler will arrange anything you require, he even asked if we wanted him to unpack for us!  The food and drink prices are expensive, but it is the most luxurious hotel in the world after all.  We have decided to return for our 30th anniversary in 18 months time, best get saving!!!!!","5","2008-11"
"Lost for words...","We were given a 2 night stay at the Burj Al Arab as a wedding present from my Auntie.  She had stayed the year before and said if there is one thing you have to do in your life is stay at the Burj Al Arab..  

When we arrived, we were lost for words.....  The staff are so attentive.  Walking in you are offered rose water, delicious dates and cool towels whist you sit in the amazing foyer while they sort out your booking.  The decor, water fountain and huge aquarium just blow you mind..Unfortunately our room was not going to be ready for another hour so they offered us complimentary drinks and nibbles in the restaurant upstairs.   The room was absolutely amazing.  Over 2 floors - amazing views.  Spectacular bathroom. Out of this world technology (there was a remote that did everything - my husband just loved this!!!)

We returned from dinner the first night to find a rose petal creation on our bed.  Whilst admiring this amazing sight there was a knock at the door and one of the staff congratulating us on our wedding and giving me a bunch of roses and bringing in champagne, a gorgeous cake and biscuits..

Unfortunately we didnt get to try the restaurants (a little bit expensive for us).  We did have a drink ($22 aud for a beer and $50 aud for a pina colada) down by the pool.  The only bad thing I have to say is that Ive had better pina coladas.  I guess for $50 I was expecting something fantastic.  For breakfast we went to the Marakesh (about a 2 minute buggy ride).  There is a Dome here which is very reasonably priced.

Another great thing is all the complimentary items and service you receive.  Although you are paying top dollar, you do get a lot included.  24hr bulter, a fruit platter , biscuits and dates everyday.  There was also free buggy transportation to the beach, the marakesh, wild waldi (free admission here too) etc.  On the beach you got complimentary water and toiletries.  When we left we got to take all the french toiletries that were supplied in our bathroom (even the slippers and thongs!!!)  It was like Xmas!!!

The overall attention to detail provided by the Burj is incredible. It was lovely to get all the attention from staff however it took a bit to get used to. 

For this couple from Perth, the Burj al Arab is an extraordinary experience.  We will be back again (when we win the lotto!!!)","5","2008-10"
"A special hotel, but not the best","The Burj is a special hotel, but it should be at the prices they charge. The service, food and room are all excellent but having stayed there once I would not return unless money was no object. Why would I not return, well I think when the novelty factor wears off you could enjoy other hotels just as much. I stayed at the Dinarobin hotel in Mauritius at the start of the same trip and the service and food was of an equal standard. I was expecting the Burj to be better in every sense but I am sure there are alternatives in Dubai which would suit me and my pocket better.","4","2008-09"
"Wow!","Please consider my comments relative to the fact the least expensive rooms at the Burj al Arab are over $2000 per night.  As such, expectations are sky high.

I agree with the last few comments on the Burj with the exception of the individual rating it who didn't actually stay there.  To provide a rating based on a refusal to be admitted is ridiculous.  The security is there to keep the many tourists who would otherwise overrun the hotel out.  As it is, guests constantly wander the hotel taking photos (myself included).

The hotel is spectacular and the staff incredibly attentive.  One of them inquired in an unobtrusive manner as to the reason for my stay and when I said it was my birthday, I was provided with a cake, flowers, etc.  All of the staff seemingly knew my name.

The standard suite I had was two stories and provided a ceiling to floor view of The Palm Island and the new Atlantis Resort.

The mixologists at the Sky Bar kept me entertained, and the view of the Burj Dubai (soon to be the world's tallest building) and Dubai coastline was extraordinary.

The overall attention to detail provided by the Burj is incredible.  That said, my one complaint involved the technology in my room, as I was unable to access the Internet on the provided laptop and I experienced difficulty on one occasion contacting my butler via my tv remote control (Yes, you are reading that correctly.).  I should note that my concerns were attended to very quickly.  While my 'complaints' are admittedly petty, remember the price of the room.

In summary, even given my propensity for finding flaws, the Burj al Arab is an extraordinary experience.","5","2008-10"
"Its the little things that count","Due to some initial communication errors, my stay was delayed a few days, but as it turned out, it was well worth the wait. Needless to say the rooms are spacious and elegant, but it is the little details that makes the difference. Just to mention a few : All the staff seemed to know who I was, I never even got to use my keycard, the butler took care of that. The range of perfumes and other beuty products available in the bathrooms was enormous. The list of these little things just go on and on. Truly an experience !!  It is only possible to award a rating of 5 on tripadvisor, but in the case an added category of +5 would be needed.","5","2008-09"
"The place is spectacular in every sense of the word.","I used the opportunity to stay here to celebrate my daughter's birthday and it didn't disappoint - right down to the extra effort made for her and the unbelievable chocolate mouse cake they sent for her. The place is spectacular in every sense of the word..

Having said that, you are paying for the experience. It was, most likely, a once-in-a-lifetime stay as once you get past all the overwhelming sensations it substantially reduces what I would pay again.

But, for those looking for the experience I recommend it.","5","2008-08"
"simply the best","Booked the burj to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday. I had read all about the burj before hand and was worried it would not live up to my expectations-I was wrong, it exceeded them all!

Driving up to the burj was an amazingsight that made us giggle with delight. We were checked in by security at the bridge who must have informed reception of our arrival, despite it being 8am, we were met at the door by welcoming staff with cold drinks and cold towel, paper work was discretly handled in minutes before being taken up the escalators to the internal lifts to our suite on the 21st floor. Here our butler took over with the guided tour of our suite, whilst another checked passports etc. The butler was fantastic very reasurring and never overpowering, and never made us feel uncomfortable, he completely put us at our ease, we declined his offer to unpack, but after an overnight flight accepted his offer to run us a special jacuzzi bath. It was very useful to have the guided tour as the suites are huge and packed with gadgets.

I was worried about tipping and after reading forums decided on tipping the porters 20 dirrhams/bag and our butler 100 dirrhams. I had to catch the butler to tip him as he was trying to leave very discretly indeed. 

We arranged a guided tour of the hotel at 11am with our butler, this gave us a couple of hours to enjoy the suite, checking out all the amazing freebees, full sized Hermes products for him and her, for the men-aftershave, post shave balm, shaving cream, guilette razors, beautiful soaps, shampoo and conditioner, luxury slippers, moisturising cream, full sized toothpaste and colgate toothbrushes, coombes and loads of other stuff, the wife had similar range of goodies including La prarie (?spelling) moisturising cream. There was also a bottle of wine, cakes sweats,fruit and flowers. Not to mention the laundry bags which came in handy too.

11am came and we had a personalised tour of the burj, we started at the skybar and worked our way down to the underwater themed restaurant with its private dinning areas, Nick our butler was obviously very proud to work at the burj and took delight in showing us around. all the staff went out of their way to make us feel very welcome indeed. Following the tour we played a game of squash-we must have been the only people to have played for ages, they supplied brand new top quality rackets and balls, we were the first to put 'ball marks' on the court. we then went to the pool area where we were taken to our sunloungers, towels spread out, sunshade erected and bottles of water and ice came and went without raising a finger. Someone came and cleaned our sunglasses, gave us some water spray and a newspaper.

The pool area was empty, we were the only ones swimming and felt very protected by the lifeguards. We ordered lunch from the sunloungers and were seated only when the order was ready. I had to order the Wagu beefberger (£40), my wife had a great salad nicoise (£15) and 2 diet cokes (£4), the menu was reasonably priced except for the wagu, but when in rome!the food was worth every penny. 

We spent the afternoon at the waterpark which was empty ( I suspect everyone had gone to the atlantis) no queues at all. We went to the private beach and had similar 7 star treatment. Then back to the pool for more pampering before back to the suite. We were greated by another butler who poured some wine, changed the fruit bowl and cut up a beautiful fruit tart (I tipped him 50 dirrhams). we went upstairs, housekeeping had replaced everything and set out the suite for the evening with more chocolates and freebees on the bed. 

We went to the skybar for a cocktail each at 100 dirrhams, this included a selection of canapies and was excellent value. we ate at the souk next door in the irianian restaurant (My wife is iranian) and had a fantastic meal at a bargain price. We finally retired back to the burj where housekeeping had turned down the room and left more freebees.

We slept so comfortably and only just made it to breakfast-but glad we did, we ate at the poolside buffet and ate very well indeed, huge selection of food, the best were eggs benedict and florentine, fillet steak and king prawns as well as usual selection, all simply fabulous (The breakfast I thought although fab was just bettered by breakfast at the shangri-la hotel singapore). We checked out at midday with bulging suitcases, smelling of Hermes products and thoroughly rested and truely impressed by the Burj (our bill for food and drinks was less than £100), we even got to keep the ?leather key wallet.

We sadly left the burj to go the Al Maha desert resort for 2 nights (more at that review-but also fantastic). Our overall impression was of surprisingly understated luxury with service one could only dream of. I will be saving up to go again next year. Everyone should go at least once in their lifetime-if only for one night.","5","2008-09"
"Fit for a Princess","This hotel is absolutely without a doubt seven star. The service is unobtrusive yet charming, the room service is like dining at Nobu or Cipriani... in fact I recommend it over the food at the restaurants there. It was simply an unbelievable experience that I did not want to finish!

We arrived and were seated in the grand foyer, given sweet coffee and dates then quickly shown to our room. We stayed for seven nights in the junior suite and when we were first shown to our room I didn't quite believe what I saw. Plush royal blue and ornate gold decor, sure it is over the top opulent but it really blew me away... in fact I thought I was going into an office (as the suite has it's own business centre) until I saw ceiling to floor sweeping views of the ocean.

The bedroom was wonderful with an enormous bed so comfortable we overslept each morning and the television system is fantastic, with one remote you can turn off lights, open curtains, call for your 24 hour butler...

Each day we were given gifts on our pillows in the evenings (lipgloss, nail clippers etc) and a box of macaroons/nuts/chocolates in our lounge. The complimentary Hermes products were restocked each time they would mysteriously dissapear ... well I wanted my moneys worth!

It was like a fabulous apartment, truely regal and exactly like the photographs but better, definately worth the £1,000 a night.

The pool is gorgeous and the surrounding area is stunning, it is a truely breathtaking hotel. The 'underwater' restaurant is remarkable and a wonderful way to end your visit.

I definately reccomend this hotel. The only thing I would change is that the satelite TV is mostly Arabic, it would benefit from more English or American options, yet they have a full list of new release films also.","5","2008-04"
"Out of this world","Dear Reader

We were really looking forward to this trip following the various reviews.

We got back yesterday (spent 6 nights) and our holiday in Burj Al Arab was absolutely fantastic.  We were both gobsmacked as we first entered the hotel.  Some people may find the hotel OTT but it actually isn't.  It's so vast, the colour, decor and furnishings compliment the building. I would describe it as contemporary Arab chic.

The general ambience of the hotel is amazing, and we absolutely loved the style of the Junsui restaurant on the mezzanine floor, beautifully styled.  All the restaurants were fantastic as was the food and wine but, extremely pricey.  A three course meal for 2 with one bottle of wine wasn't under £600.

Our room was amazing. Go for the Panoramic suite if you can (it's worth the cost) as most of the walls are floor to ceiling windows, so the views are breathtaking.

The butlers are fab, very attentive. A different treat was left for you every evening.

We preferred the private beach than the pool. We smiled the first time we got there.......it has it's own reception room where you get checked in and escorted to your sun loungers - FAB!

Would we go again, most definitely.","5","2008-09"
"I wasn't prepared for it!","This hotel has got to be one of my most unforgettable experiences. The opulence, rich detail and service was beyond my imagination. Each luxurious suite comes with its own butler who can attend to all your requests 24/7. During my stay, I started coming down with flu because of too much work prior to the visit. They immediately called for the resident physician and made sure I was alright throughout my stay.

While the interior was too much for my taste (all the gold trims - real and not), it exuded luxury. Had the opportunity to see the grandest suite (I forget the name) and it was stunningly seductive!

All restaurants boasted of excellent cuisine, and beyond the cuisine really was the unique style of each.

I'm only too glad I had a chance to see it during a business trip as it could be my one and only chance to see it.","5","2003-12"
"nice hotel","This hotel is located in Persian Gulf between Iran and Dubai. Although the price is high but it is worth to visit this hotel.
The best thig of this hotel is that you can have a perfect view of Great Persian Gulf.
All the rooms are highly equipeted and Restaurants are great.","4","2006-05"
"What your not told","Hello to all of you looking to visit the wonderous Burj al Arab on your visit to Dubai. Throughout all the reviews I have read it tells you time and time again this hotel is a must visit on anyones stay in this city. It has shopping areas, Bars, and great restaurants. All may be well and true but if you are not a guest at the hotel or not booked for one of eiither Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner dont bother paying the taxi fare as you wont be allowed in.I had turned up in very smart clothing on the evening as it was my intension to take my wife to shop in Sak's 5th Ave and then to go for a drink in the Sky Bar but we were turned away at the gate by security.  I have stayed at many top rated hotels with just as good architecture but that has never stopped to intrested tourist access to view what it claims to make it so special

.","1",
"Serious WOW factor!!","We booked into the Burj for the first part of our Honeymoon and found it to be the most magnificent hotel inside and out, so much attention to detail and extremely Luxurious.
It was a real experiance and definately worth doing for a special occasion. We did find however that was all a little overwhelming and found it hard to relax, our butler contstantly wanting to do things for us, staff coming in alot to tidy up. We ended up going to its sister hotel accross the road to use thier pool as we found it more relaxing there.
The skybar do amazing cocktails and not much more expensive than london prices approx £10-£12 each and definately worth the view.
We had a lovely surprise when we arrived back to our room on the first night to champagne and a choclate cake to congratulate us on our wedding, along with roses chocolates on the bed such a nice touch.","5","2008-08"
"Heaven on Earth","From the pick up sevice at the airport, where Rols with flowers, water and cold towels waiting for us, welcome dates in the lobby, suite, service,food,...everything was immaculate. I have stayed in a many 5 star hotels around the world, but Burj is the best. We stayed in the smallest suite, arr.180 m2. Hermes freebies are waiting for us, also praline, wine, dates, fancy water,..Service- this is something special, which gives that hotel final touch, from butler, waitress, beachboys,security,....On the beach and pool they have a man which cleans your sunglasses. Free water, Evian spray and Lavander spray with cold towel you will get when you arrive on the beach. Ice is changing at least every hour. 
We even have laptop in the suite in which my husband put our Card from camera ( he forgot to put first camera in some card holder),in order to transfer photos on usb; and the card stuck in the laptop. I was in panic because all of our photos were in that card. He just called the butler and he for 30 minutes came back with laptop and saved card. Restaurants are great , breakfast is fabolous, also  we were in Al Mahara and Al Munthana restaurants. Many people say that food is expensive, but I think that quality , service, taste and little touches worth that money.
After Burj we were going to Abu Dhabi  Emirates Palace. Great hotel, without any complaint, but when we arrived at Emirates Palace, we were not impressed with anything.Burj is 2 stars over.
Burj costs a lot of money, but, it is unique and really worth every cent. I am starting saving money to next holidays in Burj!","5","2008-08"
"Burj oh beautiful Burj!","My family 2 adults and 2 kids stayed at the Burj for a week on our way back from Europe.  We had stayed at the Al Qsar on the way over to Europe.We had an excellent stay at Al Qsar but every day we would look out the window and upwards to the worlds only 7 star hotel.  We decided you only live once so why not splurge on our return visit to Dubai and stay at the magnificent Burj.  

We arrived in the early hours of the morning and we were told whilst still on board the plane that we may not be able to get to our hotel as several main roads in dubai would be closed due to a US VIP who was visiting Dubai.  Luckily we arrived in Dubai just before the streets were locked down.  When we arrived at the Burj we were advised that the VIP would be arriving at the hotel that morning and as such all our belongings would need to be xrayed.  They said there would be alot of extra security and we would not be able to leave the hotel or move around the hotel for most of the day.  The VIP turned out to be president Bush.  We were shown to our suite but we were all eghausted so went straight to sleep without taking too much in.  When we awoke we were all very hungary and ready to test some of the Burj room service.  ""Sorry Madame but due to the VIP coming we cannot get any room service to you as the lifts have been shut down.  We will send your butler to the suite to explain the situation."" The butler arrived and apologised profusely when he realised they had not thought to make arrangements for a hungry family of four.   We had travelled most of the night so were probably not in the best shape to deal with the thought of not being able to eat or move from our room for most of the day.  We also had an issue with the blinds in the room.  We were promptly upgraded to a two bedroom suite and arrangements were made to get us fed.  

The two bedroom suite was magnificent words cannot describe how unbelievable it was from the size to the attention to detail and the wonderful view.  There were 4 flatscree tv's a lounge room dining room kitchen area and two massive bedrooms upstairs both with enormous ensuite bathrooms with full size hermes products.  Every night a little gift was left on our pillows lip balm, sleep spray, la prairie face cream, perfumes  and chocolates.  Our room was filled with fresh flowers .  The butler would come every night with a selection of nibbles and drinks.  Our butler would fill the childrens bath of an evening for us and we were suprised he actually asked what our preferred tempreture would be.  Having never really thought about that before we left it to the butlers discretion.  We ordered some of the worlds most expensive room service most nights but it again was unbelievable.  The kids had burgers that were delivered in there own Burj packaging similar to McDonalds.  The meat patty in the burger is made from none other than Waygu beef.

We went to the Skybar one evening to sample Burj cocktails.  The mixologist comes around with his cart of fresh fruits and various spirits to hand mix your cocktail.  I had two of the most wonderful cocktails I have ever tasted.

I sampled the spa which was also an exceptional experience.  There facials are amazing I felt pampered and younger as a concequence.

The indoor swimming pools (there are two) both overlooked Dubai and the ocean.  One is ladies only in keeping with Muslim requirements.  These spaces were lovely with heating swimming pools and spas and were empty most times we used them - felt like they were our own private sanctuary.

Used the hotel cars regualary to go shopping.  The rolls were gorgeous!  The shopping in Dubai is also fantastic.  Had to slow down or buy more bags - bought more bags!

Kids club in the hotel is small but available free to inhouse guests.  Our kids went a couple of times to play computer games and most times were the only kids in there so not the place for kids to meet other little ones.

The architecture lights, fountains, fish tanks and water features are amazing.  We were told that the hotel is closed to tourists but we saw several hundred of them every day in the foyer area and on the first floor?  Lots of cameras snapping and it sometimes was a little hard to move freely through these areas without the feeling you would be imposing on peoples photos.   Was a little annoying.  We also strolled around the building one afternoon only to be stopped twice whilst our guest information was checked.  Very high levels of security which is good but left you a little uncomfortable about being constantly watched.

We got to know the guy downstairs who serves the tea and dates to guests coming and going.  He was delightful and ensured he always had a burj chocolate for the children.  

Finally this was a very expensive but brilliant experience.  I still dream of the Burj often and hope I will return again in the future.  If you get the chance to experience the unique and beautiful Burj you will not be dissappointed.  Part of this hotels mission statement is to never say no to a guest regardless of the request. You will not be disappointed.","5","2008-01"
"i love you my husband hates you","i could sense my husbands unease when arriving at the hotel at 5.30am. his surprise had not been delivered!
he had booked a rolls royce and the meet and greet service he boomed. i could tell they had boo booed as they just were not expecting us, no dates, water , towels etc. and the roller was supposed to be a surprise.
we were a party of 4 it was our wedding anniversary and it was a bad start. whilst the ""madman"" was showing his confirmation on transfers and early checkin we sat around still with no service. eventually we were shown to our rooms.
again my husband pointed out the emails on the rooms laptop and generally paced the suite. the poor butler was trying to give a demo on the rooms facilities so husband again pointed to an email from the burj welcoming us back for the 8th time!
i was hoping it wouldnt be the last.
when the butler returned with some drinks i was having a lie down and treating myself to some complimentary la prairie.
were off ! the husband shouted, 2nd floor, what view is that!
i bet the butler ""melvin"" wished he hadnt opened the curtains.
off to the 16th floor. the 2 girls werent bothered so they stayed put more out of avoiding dad than wanting a good view.
we stayed for a week and every day we got an apology from everyone including ""stephanie"" the duty manager.
wait though it got a little worse. my husband was continually asked what the hotel could do to make ammends. they offered us a rolls for a whole day which he didnt need so he asked that the rolls could take the 2 girls and another 2 friends  to the MOE
for shopping and a movie. no problem, then with an hour to go the butler said it couldnt bring them back! cue husband blowing a gasket.
stephanie got it sorted, long trip out via the palm dropped outside the kempinski and the roller just a telehone away when needed for the return.
thank the lord.
food wise, fantastic, service around the pool, special thanks to namir and tag for the champers and strawberries.
we ate in junsui with friends for the evening buffet which was good and expensive. the cost of drinks breaks world records in this hotel. the bab al yam for breakfast is always my favourite, very relaxed with a fantastic selection. i could eat the breakfast all week. we got sloshed in the skybar, again very pricey but worth the blast. it helps to have a few drinks with the mirrors on the ceiling!! the usual toiletries and delicacies were given daily and the butlers were efficient if not a little intrusive, they always seemed to be ringing the bell. maybe trying a little too hard.
the stay  was brilliant and i hope my husband calms down and we go back, right up until we left they were apologising offering to deal direct with shakir the reservations manager and trying to shove us into a roller but my husband would not relent.
its the best hotel ive ever stayed in but my husband is determined to find a better one in dubai. does anyone know one!","4","2008-08"
"Can I live here?","WOW!!!!    I can't stop thinking about our stay on Burj Al Arab.  Many years ago, I saw a documentary on this hotel and always wanted to go.  Finally, for our Anniversary we decided to stay for 1 night.  

Our room was a Panoramic Suite with view to the city and the Arabian Sea.  (Many of the hotel rooms the view is only to the sea). The room has 2 levels. The 1st level is office area, dining, living room, bar, closet and bathroom.  The 2nd level is bedroom, master bath, and walking closet.  

Service is outstanding!  Everytime we requested the Butler's service, he arrived immediately.  At one time, we had problems with the Internet connection in the room and the IT person came very fast.  Can you imagine?  An IT person in a hotel!  

There are all kind of menus in the room:  ""Newspapers Menu"", ""Pillow Menu"", ""Aromatherapy-Bath Menu"".  There is even a ""wall projection clock"" which I found very cool.

There were also many ""gifts"" in the room.  The Hermes products are full size (separate products for Men and for Women), cookies, dates, a canvas bag for you to take.  Also, since it was our Anniversary we received a surprise cake, roses, and sparkling juice.

If you ask me to compare this hotel to another one, I'll say that there is no comparison and this is why they said that they are a 7-star hotel.  Will I stay again?  Definitely, yes!!!!  Staying at the Burj Al Arab is really something that should be done at least once in a lifetime.","5","2008-07"
"Deserves the hype !","Me and my wife stayed at the Burj as part of our honeymoon.

We had booked a helicopter transfer, but due to delays in our flight, the hotel had to cancel this, but provided Rolls Royce transfers instead.

From the moment we checked in, it was obvious...this was no ordinary hotel.  The decor is outstanding, the attention to detail is stunning, and the rooms are just amazing.

Our room was more like an apartment.  Set over two floors, with the biggest jacuzzi bath I have ever seen. The staff couldn't do enough to make us feel special, even giving us a choclate cake, and flowers to celebrate our marriage.

Put simply, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at...in terms of pure luxury !

We loved the Burj, and will DEFINATELY try to go back one day.","5","2008-04"
"good and bad...","Only a few coments as there is enough to read from others here.
  We were particularly worried about the staff 'asking for tips' described in other reviews. It was not a problem. Start as you mean to go on and don't tip the luggage porters. There is a very good DND - 'do not disturb' system operated via the TV, high tech and over complicated but it is worth the effort to get this explained, and also a low tech card thing to hang on the door. These worked for us.
        Good things: 
  'You have to try the frozen youghurt at breakfast, better than ice cream and you can pretend it's healthy and the express lift to 27th floor,' so says my partner.
Staff everywhere were discreet and managed to leave you alone but were there if you wanted them.
   Bad things:
 The over-long explanation of the window drapes, the tv, dvd, laptop, the lights, the temperature control, the shower, the bath, the safe, the pillow menu (I am not joking) etc  etc etc...
  The Al Marha Restaurant; an extremely tacky 'submarine' ride to a table by a giant fish tank. I was told repeatedly that a jacket was required, so I obliged, but this did not seem to apply to all the other male diners.
  On checking out they attempted to charge us for breakfast that should have been included and managed to duplicate the cost of dinner and charge us twice. A month later and we're still trying to get a refund. Check carefully before you leave, it's not as if they haven't got enough out of you already!","4","2008-07"
"This is how the other half live!!!!","My wife and I stayed here in between watching the Australian Socceroos play Qatar in Qatar and a conference in the Jumeira Madinat next door. (see separate review) This was our little treat to ourselves.

What a treat. I am a very self-reliant and low key person, so felt a little uncomfortable at the start when greeted by 4 people lined up at the entry with cold face towels, juice etc. But, hey, I got over it real quick. This is a hotel where EVERY staff member greets or acknowledges you if they pass within 2 metres. After taking copies of your passport, you are taken to your floor level to be checked into your room - in your room. Your personal floor butler takes you on a guided tour of your two level suite and then you complete the documentation necessities at your study desk. Complimentary unlimited internet access is provided on your supplied laptop (we also had our own laptop and the IT people set it up with wireless access for us - this was a great way to stay in touch with friends and family + attend to the business obligatories whilst away).
When reading the reviews on this hotel regarding decor etc, you must remember that this hotel is one of excess. As such, the decor fits the bill. Try this decor anywhere else and you probably would throw up, but here it really emphasises what they are trying to achieve. Other reviews have said it all already - massive standard 1 bedroom suites over two levels, massive bathroom and powder room, full size Hermes products for him and her, daily afternoon snacks worthy of the desert menu in any 5 star restaurant and the list goes on.
Whilst this hotel is HUGE in stature, there are only 202 suites so it is quite rare to wait for anything. We only encountered people in the lift once in our 3 day stay. We always got a sun lounge by the pool. Whilst the pool is relatively small, it is usually relatively empty of people swimming as well. The private beach is also a great way to go. You are escorted to your sun lounges and umbrella and provided with 2 towels each -1 for the lounge and one to dry off. Bottled water and ice are topped up VERY regularly - the ice doesn't get time to melt.
The only downside of the whole experience is cost of food and alcohol. I was expecting it to be expensive, but still got a shock at some of the prices. We only booked 2 restaurants - Ultimate High Tea at Sahn Eddar (a truly wonderful experience) and dinner at Al Mahara (their signature restaurant). We were very hyped up about dinner based on all their promotion of the restaurant. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. Whilst the food was excellent quality and the aquarium was a great focal point it was not value for money. 1 glass of champagne on arrival for my wife, 1 glass of white wine for my wife and 1 JD and Coke for me with our meals which was 2 x ""seafood platter for 1"". Total cost US$475. Again, we weren't expecting normal prices but......
Would I stay at this property again? Probably not-once was enough for me. Would I recommend it to someone else? DEFINITELY. You HAVE to experience the ultimate in service, decadence and attention to detail it at least once in your life...no matter what the cost.","5",
"Lives up to reputation","Stayed for 2 nights at end of trip to Dubai which also included 8 nights in Residence at One & Only ( read separate review ).I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about stay, having heard such comments as TACKEY, and OTT. I have been for dinner and drinks and have never thought it to be tackey. Tackey to me is Blackpool, or downtown Las Vegas. Hears my take the service is the best in Dubai, The staff are the best trained, and  the longest serving of all the hotels in Dubai, many over 5 years (a rarity in Dubai ). The staff per guest  ratio is the most of any hotels worldwide. The suites are spectacular ours was a two bedroom. It was massive, three bathrooms, two living-rooms, two dining areas, a fully fitted kitchen, a dressing room, 4 televisions, and an incredible 16 phones( yes I counted). You also get your very own  butler, another myth I'd like to burst is I've heard people say that the staff are always in your face, not true if you dont want disturbed then you wont be, They are there to serve you not control you, and at no given time did I feel suffocated. The pool area is quite compact, but yet again the service is impecable. I'm sure if  you wanted the staff would have given you a quiet spot if you wanted. There is also a private beach (there are better) and an indoor pool attached to the spa and fitness which is stunning although I have been in nicer spas ie The spa at the One & Only is a class apart. To sum up this lengthy report if you have booked you are in for a treat, don't listen to the negative reports I believe they come from certain catagorys of people. 1/ People who have never actually stayed and are jealous. 2/ People who can't afford to go back so they talk it down to make theuselves fell better. 3/ People who felt it was to much for them and felt uncomfortable. 4/ People who prefer to be big fish in small ponds. Would I go back in a flash, would I recommend it absolutly. It quite simply is the most luxurious hotel on the planet.","5","2008-07"
"Totally hilarious!","Firstly, I would like to express to Tripadvisor how disappointed I am that this world famous hotel is not listed on your Best Of... awards.

You astonishingly have no Middle Eastern category, which is not only bizarre but also for an international hotel review site completely WRONG as in my experience some of the finest hotels are in this part of the world. I know you are an American site, but this part of the world not only exists but shock horror, can also be quite fabulous.

And this hotel is no exception. It's billed as 7 star and not far off it as service goes.... personal butler etc. I found this a little intrusive at time but that's part of the whole experience being completely OTT.... great if you like that sort of thing! My hubbie & I are a little more low key but we found the experience amusing somewhat. 

We stayed in a one bed suite which I think is the smallest in the hotel but still it was vast... bigger than most flats in London! The bathroom itself is bigger than most hotel rooms. The decor is truly, fabulously hideous! If Liberace was born again as an interior designer, this would be his baby. There is sooo much going on in the colour scheme it is actually quite tiring to look at for long. Lots of gold and shockingly for a Muslim country, mirrors strategically placed above the bed and by sofa in the bathroom.... ;o)!

We loved the fruit bowl & delicious munchies left every day in the room. there were nice personal touches here and there. However, on a few occasions we had left things around which when we returned to were inexplicably disposed of, including most of a very expensive drink!

The only downside is that numerous times my hubbie was spoken to and consulted on my behalf with me standing right there as if I were a mute lemon! I realise these can be Arabic customs but I have never before encountered them on my extensive travels in this area. For an international hotel to adopt this practice with it's numerous western guests seems a tad insulting. 

Overall, a fun stay!","4","2008-02"
"What a special treat","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab as a special treat. It is so expensive costing £750 a night excluding breakfast but we went to get engaged so it was a special occasion. Is it worth it? Definately as a one off but to be honest its too much. The hotel is simply stunning and the rooms are amazing. The service is excellent. We ate at the Japanese restaurant within it and it was fantastic. I went to the spa and it was empty but i also got a treatment which was expensive and probably not worth it. A can of diet coke is £4.50 by the pool. You are given free water topped up with ice and evian spray together with cool towel and lavender spray...all nice touches. The pool itself is nothing to write home about and is quite restictive with regards to sunbathing. Will I ever go back...maybe for afternoon tea but not to stay. We stayed at the Jumeriah Beach hotel its sister hotel beside it and its fantastic for half the price....we stayed in the Club Executive part of Jumeriah Beach and its the best ever!","5","2008-07"
"Amazing","I have stayed here twice, once in 2002 , and again for the new year of 2006. what a hotel

No complaints here, great value for money, i paid 5700 for 8 nights with BA, and it was worth every penny you get treated like an arab princess, or prince. 

We will return again soon,

"OTT","We stayed here for 6 days for our wedding anniversary.  We've stayed in some top hotels around the world and been treated pretty good but this was a whole other experience.  It is definitely a once in a lifetime thing, I'm glad we did it but I wouldn't do it again.  We ate at the roof top restaurant and the food was excellent and so was the view.  Given the rating of this hotel I didnt find the cost too bad (approx £200 for 3 courses plus cocktails).  

The location is great if you want to stay in the immediate area for the sister hotels, Emerates mall and Water park, but we found getting around very stressfull due to the amount of construction traffic congestion and wreckless driving style of taxis.

The butlers buzzed round like annoying flies and it became tedious to have to keep swatting them away.  They even let themselves into our room whilst I was in the bath despite have informed us earlier that we would have to buzz them in.  It was to bring us flowers and chocs for our anniversary but they wouldn't leave them, they wanted to hand them over personally (I assume to get tips) so they took the gifts away again and came back 20 minutes later making us late for our dinner booking.

My advice would be to stay here for 2 nights, then book yourself into somewhere else in the old part of town for a bit of peace and to soak up more of the culture.","4","2007-04"
"Loved The Burj........Can't wait to go back!!","Having only ever had Afternoon Tea at Burj al Arab we promised ourselves we would one day stay here and realised our dream earlier this month.
I know there are lots pf people think this hotel is OTT and Tacky but I didn't feel this at all (Well apart from Skyview Bar)
Arriving by hotels BMW 7 Series I must admit we felt a bit apprehensive about staying here and worried we would be out of our depth but on check in we very quickly dismissed those feelings.
We were taken straight to our suite after being meet by many smiling faces at the entrance and inside the lobby. Receptionist could not have been more friendly, asking us how our flights had been etc. Once inside our suite (212) we had to contain our excitement while we were shown around by our Butler Cliff. He explained all the gadgets to work TV, Curtains, Door etc and I really had to try hard not to look overcome. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne, bottle of red wine and very posh French Water along with all the Herme's goodies in the bathrooms. I was in heaven! So was hubby, he was even checking that I didn't have more Herme's than him!
After the Butler left our suite we jumped up and down and said to each other ""This is the Life"" Well it was only for 2 days! We decided to chill out on our first day after travelling for nearly 24 hours so we got showered and changed into our bathrobes and slippers ready to relax for the day.
Later in the afternoon we thought we had better unpack and just after we had finished another Butler came to our suite with a bottle of Dom Perignon Vintage Champers! Wow! What had we done to deserve this, it wasn't as if we stated a Special Occassion or anything. Butler said ""Nice bottle of Champagne with Compliments from the Management"" As he was pouring it a Front of House Manager called (Jari Neilson, mislaid his card unfortunately) and asked if we were happy with our suite to which we replied ""Yes Thank you very much"" He then said ""I would like to upgrade you to a Two Bedroom Suite which wasn't available when you checked in this morning"" My hubby and I looked at each other in astonishment and didn't really know what to say. We very gracefully declined and told said man we were very happy where we were but thanked him so much for the lovely gesture! Yes, we were crazy and if we hadn't unpacked and had been dressed we would have gone like a shot!
We had ""Private Dining"" which was very good and not overly expensive. Well we had to drink our Dom Perignon!
After a great nights sleep in a very comfy and massive bed (Word of advice, Don't look up! Could have done without that mirror) we had breakfast in Al Iwan where we were to have it for both days. Great Selection of food and we loved the corner booths looking out into the lobby. Staff in there were so friendly and always making sure we had everything we needed. 
We then went out for the day (I really didn't want to) and on return smiling faces greeted us from the taxi ""Welcome back Mr & Mrs ************* Lovely when they know your name as soon as you arrive! We ate out at Nina  in One & Only on our second night and really wish now we had dined at the Burj.
Upon return we were greeted in the same way and our floor consierge informed us a BMW 7 Series would be taking us across to Dar Al Masyaf around 11-30 am next morning. The girl even knew which type of room we had booked at DAM (Unfortunately this did not materialise but will do seperate review on that)
So back to room to pack up to go next day and already were feeling quite sad. We have never stayed in a hotel where the staff were so wonderful. We were made to feel really special and there were much more important guests staying than us.
I just loved the opulence and splendour of the whole place and could very easily get used to it! Well for a while anyway!
On check out the next morning we were feeling a bit deflated and when the bell boys started to wave us off I nearly cried! My hubby kept looking back and saying ""Bye Bye Burj! Sad!
Will we return??? Too right we will, just as soon as the Bank Balance allows LOL
Just a little tip, you may take it or you may not but if you decide to have a couple of nights at the Burj Al Arab I suggest you leave them to the end of your trip as after staying there the other hotels have a lot to live up to. In our experience anyway!","5","2008-06"
"Drean Come True","I recently spent 2 nights at the Burj al Arab and it was everything I had expected it to be.  I am someone who loves hotels and I first heard about this one about 5 years ago.  I have dreamed of staying there ever since.  The rooms are incredible and you have your own butler to help with anything you need.  Be sure and either have Afternoon Tea or go for drinks at the Skyview Bar.  The view from there is unbelievable.  This is a once in a lifetime experience.  Do not miss it if you are in the area.","5","2008-06"
"stay there but only for the  service","I'm  in dubai quite often and either stay at the Burj or The emirate towers , Burj al arab is nice thats the only word i want to use for it  , it`s one of those places that people talk about so much ,  it almost becomes necessary to go to. The service it immaculate.,i am very sensitive about it but i cant complain at all and trust me i would ,the management know what they are doing , there are right people on every position , the butler , the reception and so on ...
BUT i have to say this the food is awful , and the  decoration in the suits are well , let me just say tasteless , nevertheless the service is the reason why we always go back and its child friendly so stay there but eat elsewhere   there are other restaurants near by at the Madinat  jumeirah (5 min away) that are good and i have to mention this for the readers that like me are a bit selective when it comes to hotels and service AT 23.30 i called my butler and wanted my trouser ironed and a tweezer with in less than 10 min i had the tweezer and my trousers took less than 30 min","5","2006-12"
"Must try once in your life","The Burj Al Arab is very nice. The rooms are all suites and very spacious. they are all 2 floors with beautiful views. Every floor has the own butler at their service. The rooms are clean and the hotel is well situated.

While the service is great, it is not a 7 star. But don't get me wrong, the service is good. A 7 star for me means to go beyond the expected and they do not do that. They could not make reservation at 2 restaurants I wanted. They would not use the Rolls Royce Phantom to take me to the airport even though one was available and out in front of the hotel.

Would I stay here again? Probably not. There are plenty of better values for your money. However, as one who likes to try luxury hotels, it was worth the stay!","4","2007-04"
"Very Interesting","I just asked my teenage daughter what she thought of the Burj and she just said ""Interesting - I mean it was gooood but weird.""
I think that's a good way to put it.  It is over the top and I LOVE the other reviewer who said it is decorated like ""Versace on acid.""  The place is gaudy and flashy yet some how it all works.  

We had a two bedroom suite and believe me there was PLENTY of room for a family of four.  Our children shared a bedroom and we had the master suite but the bathrooms were the exact same.  We had a separate dressing area which  the kids did not.  

The two bedroom suite has two separate living rooms, a dining area, a kitchen, an office/bar area and a small powder room.  If you really want to see what it looks like go to YouTube.com and type in Burj Al Arab; some people have posted home videos of the suites there. 

There are a lot of tourists visiting the public areas which is a bit overwhelming and hectic by times.  But once you get into the guest only areas it is so quiet you can then really appreciate the hotel.  It has many beautiful areas.

The spa is great.  In the women's spa be sure to ask for a therapy room with a view.  I was in a room overlooking the water with the Palms in the distance, it was spectacular.  

The beach area is fun but you need to get there by 10:30-11am to get ocean front.  Be sure to schedule at lest one beach day - you will be pampered.  It is thoroughly enjoyable.  The pool is also nice and the pool restaurant is better than usual pool faire. They have a great lunch time buffet.

The butlers are there to serve and take care of you so sit back and enjoy the experience because they are going to keep showing up over and over again!  Take advantage of the unpacking and repacking of your luggage; not many hotels offer that and that's just one of the things that sets this hotel apart from the rest.  

We stayed at the Burj for five nights and the first day is somewhat overwhelming but we quickly became used to the over the top service.

I have to warn you that his place is EXPENSIVE.  My daughter ordered a couple of Shirly Temple drinks (just soda and cherry grenadine) they cost $25 EACH!!  Their highlight restaurant Al Mahara (the one with the aquarium) listed soup for $70 a bowl.  Champagne cost $200 a glass.  We were quite prepared for an expensive vacation but some of the prices were stupidly expensive and the quality of the food while good, was simply not worth the prices.  Some of the restaurants at the Burj's sister hotels had food as good or better at 1/3 to 1/2 the price.

All in all, still an experience not to be missed.","4","2008-04"
"Okay.......","I was at the Burj for a 7 night stay, the room and decor are as I say ' versace on acid' - extremally in your face but somewhole it pulls it off because it is so extravagent. I arrived at DXB in the morning and had the staff waiting for me - to escort me to the helicopter, i didnt even need to get my bags which was nice. The helicopter ride was very nice lasting about 15 minutes, great views of S.Z road and the palms. The landing was very fun and one of the highlights of the trip. Once we got inside i was escorted to my room on the 25th floor - i think it was the top range suite but Im not sure - check in took place in my room and was pretty quick. One thing i didnt care for was the butler would not leave you alone, i know its a special place, but literally they would wipe your ***!!! - the resturaunts were very good but so pricey! - overall i feel its overpriced but good for a one off, ive been here several times - because i do like the iconic nature of the place as well as the quietness by the pool.","4","2008-04"
"Seasoned Burj visitor - yes with small kids!","Stayed at the Burj many times with my 3 small children and each time it has been a wonderful experience. I find that it is relatively child friendly - OK, the restaurants dont take kids in the evening but to be honest who wants to waste that sort of money and foods on kids??!!!  The staff always seem to make a fuss of the kids and they are soon known by their names by the staff!! 
The pool area is always accomodating with the kids and the Sinbads indoor kids club on the 18th floor is a great place for them out of the hot midday sun. We usually get a buggy to Wild Wadi or the Burj beach - great to have your own space away from the masses that you can get at the other Jumeirah properties.
Staying here has got noticeably more expensive in the last year - as prices compared to the same times I went last year are up by 30 - 40%.

If you havent been here before and you are looking for a wow factor experience then this still has to be the best place in Dubai. Have eaten at the restaurants but personally I think there are better ones in Dubai and nearby for less money. Recommend the Pices in Madinat and the Fairmont hotel certainly is one of my favourites.","5","2007-09"
"Fabulous!","Everyone should stay here at least once, it was unbelieavable.  The rooms will delight and surprise even seasoned travellers.  We found the service fine, did not use the pool or restaurants as not really family orientated but it is easy to get a buggy wherever you want to go on the Jumereih strip.  Loved the whole OTT vibe, yes people coming in just to say they've been to the Burj for dinner/drinks whatever can be annoying but once you are in your beautiful room with its beautiful marble staircase/chandelier they are forgotten.

Would love to go back one day and arrive on the helipad!!!","5","2008-04"
"Absolutely Amazing","I booked a one night stay here as part of my husband's surprise birthday trip and truly believe this hotel was the icing on the cake of a fantastic holiday!

From the moment we were escorted from leaving the plane through to the moment we checked out we received outstanding service throughout our stay.

Our flight arrived at 7.00am and I had requested an early check-in, but was fully aware that this was not a certainty. However, by 9.00am we were in our beautiful 1 bedroom suite. Yes, the colours are bold and the decor is very much 'in your face'! However, when you remind yourself you're in the Burj it somehow all just makes sense and seems to fit perfectly! Your butler will show you around the suite, once they have checked you in (in the suite), but chances are you won't be paying too much attention to him because you just want to run around and try to absorb everything from the amazing views, the yummy dates and fruit, the amazing free Hermes toiletries to the remote control that contols everything!

The living area downstairs has pleanty of seating area with the separate business area with laptop. Hidden in a little cupboard behind the desk area is complimentary tea/coffee and water. The fruit bowl on the table was filled with a delicious array of exotic fruits. The staircase leads you up to the bathroom and bedroom. More amazing views from the bedroom and a very comfortable bed.... the mirror above the bed... well everyone has their own opinions! Again, a separate seating area and table within the bedroom. Between the bedroom and bathroom there is pleanty of wardrobe and luggage space. A dressing table area with a really powerful hair dryer! The bathroom is huge with 2 separate sinks, large walk-in shower and a jacuzzi bath. There is a variety of his and hers Hermes toiletries (full size bottles) which were replaced 2-3 times during our one night stay there.

Our room was serviced 3 times during our stay there and my husband was given a cake and card to congratulate him on his birthday.

We did have breakfast at Bab Al Yam which had enough food to suit  most people's needs. The private beach is lovely and is reached by the buggys that transfer you around the grounds of the hotel and the surrounding Madinat complex. Whilst on the beach, you are provided with ice towels, water and face sprays and the sunloungers were fairly well spread out. 

We have had afternoon tea at the Skyview Bar (on a previous visit) which we would highly reccomend. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants, but did the buggy over to Pierchic (at the Al Qsar hotel) and had a delicious meal to celebrate my husband's birthday.

From reading the various reviews on this website and the Dubai forum, I had gathered that the Burj attracts a variety of people. -  those that may have saved for a long time to have a once in a lifetime experience and those for whom spending a night (or several!) is a regular occurance.... I feel that whether you fall into either category or somewhere in the middle, it is an experience that you will not forget, and most likely, not regret either!","5","2008-04"
"over the top","we spent easter in dubai; our first visit there. Having booked into a premium leisure room at the Jumeirah Beach, we were literally faced with ""the Burj"". There is a huge amount of hype about this 7 star hotel so I suppose we got sucked in. I decided that, as we were ""in the area"" we would stay a couple of nights. Check-in was unimpressive as you are left sitting in the lobby while non-residents snap photos all around you. Yes, it is spectacular , but very much over the top. The rooms are super, as described in other reviews; but I was not impressed by the service. Our butler failed to tell us, despite being asked, that movies could be accessed on the tv. This resulted in an hour and a half wait that night while staff tried to find a dvd for my boys. The receptions on each floor are a bit of a nonentity as far as I could see- the kind of place one might put a trainee manager to give him something to do. Indeed, the arrogance of one of these ""guest services managers"" caused me to make a complaint to the hotel manager. (On that note, I must say that I received follow up on my return home- and a lovely bouquet of flowers)
We ate in the seafood restaurant(al mahara)- a wonderful experience and the staff was fantastic; making a big fuss of the children.There is a children,s menu, which I had not expected, and it is quite acceptable.

The rooftop restaurant(al muntaha) was, by comparison, not as good. It looked like a popular spot for ladies who lunch and there was much flashing of diamonds and gold.Children are welcome at lunchtime.

Room service was very good; promptly deliverd,beautifully served and very tasty.

Pool is a bit small and appears to have an afterthought tacked on around the edge. Pool service is very good and friendly- none of the arrogance that is displayed in other parts of the hotel.

Whilst the rooms are well maintained, it seemed to me that every time I turned around there was someone in the room doing some maintenance or other. I enjoy a twice daily service but I thought it was overdone here.

Whilst staying in Dubai, we  also went to Verre at the Hilton (Gordon Ramsey) and Frankie Dettori( at the marina) and had exquisite meals....both highly recommended.

In retrospect,staying at the Burj was the experience of a lifetime. It certainly lives up to the opulence expected of a 7 star hotel. However, I did not find that the service was 7 star. For the first time ever on a holiday, I found myself very conscios of the gap between rich and poor- highlighted by the number of workers I met in Dubai who have not seen their families for a couple of years.Would I return?? To be honest, I think it is rather like visiting SAnta in Lapland- best done  and most appreciated when done just once.","4","2008-03"
"Worth the MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","£1000 a night..............worth it as a once off or maybe more if you got the dosh!
Lets start with arrival at The Burj AL Arab...
The entrance is grand in every sense and you have to pass a security entrance before you drive onto a man made island which is the foundation for this enormous modern icon of one of the worlds most famous and luxurious hotels.
We stayed for one night which going on their prices was the price of a weeks holiday.
On arrival we were checked in with a personal butler to assist..
This was aided by cocktails, choclates and dates to wet our appetite.
Our suite was on 26th floor or 54th story and was duplex.
The colours and decor were rich and austenacious with ahuge ,amounts of gold, red, purples and silk.
The suites were huge with floor to celing views of the Arabian Gulf.
A remote control which worked all devices including, lights, entrance,tv,jacuzzis, etc was also a fond memory.
The bathroom was luxurious in every sense and we paticularly loved all our Hermes goodies!
We dined in the "" Al Mahara"" on the night of our stay which was extremely pricey but worth the exclusive feeling of being in such a special place.
The food was good but the service truly amazing.
My partners birthday was acknowledged with a surprise presentation of a most wonderful choclate cake.
Afterwards we went up to the skylounge where you paid for the privelage of a gin and tonic that had to be the worlds most expensive.
The views and the chic of the crowd and surroundings made it all worth while.
The pool area was surprisingly smaller than I thought amidst the array of the gucci and prada brigade.
All in all.......was it worth money??????????? YES......do it at least once and enjoy!","5","2006-06"
"Awesome but disappointing!","I'll start by saying the room and building itself are just an awesome site - don't get me wrong.  And just to say that I've stayed at the Burj Al Arab will be something that I really don't ever anticipate knowing anyone else will be able to match in my group of friends.  However, I was disappointed by some of the service provided.  For the money paid - I was expecting to be wowed!  The check-in was a bit of a cluster and the check-out was as well.  In fact, the entire stay went to h#$% once we recieved our checkout bill.  They have no real organized way to control the madness down at the entrance and they are trying to get people onto shuttles/taxi's/incoming passengers/etc and you are in the middle of the maddness.  The fitness center was lacking as well for such a nice place!  It was nothing better than a hilton fitness center.  All in all we don't regret staying there - but we will never do it again - merely for the price.","3","2008-03"
"Fantastic hotel, shame about the service","I stayed at the burj for two nights as a present for my boyfriend. 
 Rooms - Out of this world, the amazing two story rooms complete with 2 bathrooms, living area, seperate bedroom, changing area and business centre can only be seen to be believed! Well worth the money.
Service - the only dissappointment I experienced staying here was the terible service. The butler came into our room 6 times within the first night making it very hard to relax. We had already been warned about the 'tipping' so we decided that we would only tip at the end of our stay. However it was clear that the butler was not happy with this and became very rude. We asked for some wine glasses and were told that there were glasses in the bar- tumblers! In short not exactly 7* service.
I would not let this put you off as the rooms and building are unmissible in my view!","4","2007-06"
"Over the top","I turn 40 at The Burj. It was amazing all the way around! They start by picking you up at the airport and taking you to the front of the customs and imigration lines. When we got outside I was given roses as we steped into the car. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a line of staff members giving us cold towels, figs and drinks. The suites are just wonderful. It's like a Trump building except this is the REAL thing. The ""underwater"" restaurant was very good and it's fun to go on the ""submarine ride"" to get there. We only stayed here 1 night before a trip to the Seyshelles but it was a great way to kick off a 40th birthday. A note.. I think you have to request the special airport pickup. It's totally worth it whatever it costs. If you're spending this much it's a drop in the bucket!","5","2006-02"
"For want of sounding repetitive - Absolutely Fantastic!","Don't want to sound boring and repetitive, but I have to say we had a wonderful 2 days here at the Burj, with very little to consider as a let down (apart from undercooked scallops, but that is personal taste!)

We arrived off our overnight flight, landing around 8.30am. Through simple customs and no visa requirements, we were transported in around half an hour to the Burj.

Soon we arrived to see this huge monolith looming fast, standing proudly at the end of its private road to an island at the edge of the sea. The doors were opened and we were whisked, leaving our luggage behind,up to the lobby where a fresh petal soaked hand towel awaited us. We were asked for our passport while we sat down for about 15 minutes. Then we were escorted by some 'executive', a most pleasant and informative young oriental lady, advising us of restaurants and items of interest around the hotel - a brief orientation. 

We arrived at our suite, door ajar, where I saw a business desk, laptop, fax and printer. I assumed this is the check in desk of the whole floor. How stupid - this was part of our room, the mini business centre. Taken aback and very impressed I was asked to sit down while our butler (so posh now!) showed the good lady around with a glass of fresh OJ. I signed in, credit card imprinted, and then we were both being shown around fully. Again Allan, our Man, was informative, friendly, not obtrusive and arranged meals and Tea for us. I was shown the remote to control TV, door opening (with a CCTV through the TV), curtains et al.

Our suite was large and well presented. It had golden influences and a large chandelier hanging over the sweeping staircase to the 1st floor, but hey, it was fantastic!! Past the business area we had the mini bar and stools with complimentary expresso machine and water. Then the large sitting area with sweeping views of the World and sea. Large comfy sofas and 3 chairs around another writing desk and a small dinner table with 4 chairs, with fresh fruit each day. Night time came a knock on the door with a refreshing mousse and strawberry compote and biscuits. The second night we had cheese and biscuits! Also a downstairs, a loo and bidet the size of a small dining room at home perhaps! Plushly carpeted and very comfortable, this was a beauty of a floor.

Upstairs we had our hallway and to the left was the main bathroom, containing a large sunken jaccuzzi, walk in double shower, bidet and toilet, double large sink and sitting area. Biggest bathroom I have seen and well appointed and lots of Hermes freebies worth over a hundred pounds in all (including other extras). We had a treble wardrobe/closet and safe in the hallway and in the bedroom we had a large king size bed, a pillow menu of about 15 different pillows. Needless to say the wife put them to the test and the poor butler carried in them all with a pleasant smile, knowingly smiling at me! Curtains to the horizon were automaticaly controlled again. Lighting throughout was brilliant, with different ambient settings ranging form 1 to 5, depending on your mood and time of day.

As it happened it was my wifes birthday, and just before we went exploring there was a knock on the door. I buzzed them in to see 3 staff and a guitar wheeling in a birthday cake and card and a lovely bunch of flowers and vase. They very nicely sung Happy Birthday and another song about growing old together (and giving her the remote control - NEVER!)... Actually all very nice and poignant - unexpected pleasure, that made our day.

The lobby was swaithed in gold but I didn't find it especially tacky, the water fountaints and fish tanks either side were a nice colourful touch. The pool was nice though smaller than I expected, with beds to face the ocean. It was warm and sunny, though a bit hazy first and last thing. I had a wonderful Club sandwich and Potato wedges, all totally delicious and a mere snip at 30 pounds!

Dinner was a buffet restaurant downstairs (Bab Al Yam). Very pleasant altohugh not the most wonderful I have been to. Service was good as was the food. We had a cocktail each but at 60 pounds a head, we thought a bit overpriced. Remember where you are though and it makes it easier to pay for!

The butler was there when we wanted. He offered to swap some smaller bank notes for me, booked tea and dinner, gave advice, but as I said, he was there when we wanted, and didn't even hang around long enough for a tip (I will hunt him down later!).

Turn down was an experience with 3 staff turning up with a hoover and mop! All good, and the bed was lovely with 2 roses and a couple of goodies. Happy Birthday was again pronounced with much politeness before they went.

Have loved the 2 days here. Not intrusive or over the top, just in my view palatial luxury at a price, but worth paying for. Fantastic 6 star room, hotel, service, 5 star food if I am honest overall, but a very minor distraction to what was the best 2 days we have spent in a hotel - we will return!","5","2008-02"
"Love the hotel, but the staff....???","We stayed at the Burj for two nights towards the end of our honeymoon. Thank god we stayed two nights and not one, as we would have been leaving with a heavy heart. The rooms are excellent. 2 story suites, nothing left to the imagination. Oh yeah theceiling mirror in the bedroom got a good workout. Room service is stupidly priced. $83 australian for teriyaki chicken is way overpriced unless they are hand rearing the chickens from a young age in one of the suites.

The Jinsui restaurant is excellent. We went for lunch and stayed 3 hours and stuffed ourselves on the various food stations. Sashimi quality was some of the best I've had.

The staff are very friendly, but maybe just a bit over the top. on our first night, the first 3 hours we must have been interrupted at least 6 times. And on each occasion they expect a tip. Needless to say when I was speaking to one of them the next day, he was counting through a wad of US bills, which I assume was his tip money.

Overall the experience was excellent. We would definetly stay there again.","5","2007-12"
"A wonderful experience.","My wife and I spent three wonderful nights at the Burj on our way home from Abu Dhabi. We were spoilt by the well trained staff. Our butler and his helpers were polite and very helpful. My wife was taken ill during our last evening. (No fault of the hotel) I called room service at 2 am. The Butler sent a Paramedic within ten minutes. He was able to give my wife an injection and we were able to travel home
  When we checked out I was suprised to be told there was no charge for the Paramedic. My wife was collected from our room by wheelchair. We were taken to the airport and met with another wheelchair. Well done the Burj!  
  I forgot to mention the food was very good. If you have time try eating in your room. Quite an experience.
  We are pensioners but hope to return soon.
       Colin from Devon UK.","5","2008-02"
"Luxury","We stayed here for 2 nights to break our return to UK  from Australia. We arrived before our check in time and had to wait for our room - we were given a complimentary lunch of our choice while we waited. The staff made our wait as comfortable as possible. We didnt have a problem with this as we knew the hotel was fully booked - we had no control over our flight times so we were prepared for this. Our room was fab - 2 storey,  we had our own butler who was helpful and genuinely a nice guy. We wanted for nothing.  Yes, the dinner menu was expensive but what do you expect.  Could not fault anything - being spoilt was a great end to our holiday. If you go to Dubai and your budget allows, stay here - you will be sorry if you dont. You can only go into the Burj if you are staying there or have a dinner reservation.
Luxury 7* is exactly what it is - if I return to Dubai this is where I will stay - no doubt about it.","5","2006-12"
"What Can I Say","I honestly don't know where to start, when we first saw it in the brochure, we thought it looked nice and said, well lets see what the fuss is all about, but my god!!!

We were picked up at the airport in a gleaming white Rolls and my first glimps of the hotel as we approached was something I will never forget, the reception area, simply never seen anything like it, the huge aquiarium as you go up the escalator, the water display it was just an incredible experience. We enjoyed it so much that my wife insisted on returning the following year which we did and still felt the wow factor.
It was a fairy tale experience but it was real.","5","2004-05"
"WOW","This hotel is amazing. Customer service is fantastic, hotel room is amazing with everything you would ever need. Facilities are perfect. If you are in Dubai you have to have at least 1 night at this hotel as it is an experience not to be missed.

The only negative is that the top floor bar is a little boring with no music and basic cocktails and the seafood restaurant is very expensive","5","2007-12"
"Worth 7 Stars","The Burj Al Arab was the most opulent place we've been! There is gold, colouful water fountains and fresh flowers everywhere. 

We stayed here for the last night of our honeymoon in a panoramic suite. The suite was over two floors, with a hot tub and large shower, as well as full size complimetry Hermes toiletres for him and her. We had a butler to cater for all our needs and who came to run our hot tub for us!

The staff are extremely helpful and will continuously provide you with cold flannels and fresh water with ice by the poolside. 

The food is lovely and you can have anything from cereal, to scrambled eggs and salmon to steak for breakfast! We ate in the restaurant on the 27th floor and it was a great experience., with live music and unusual cocktails.

This is a once in a lifetime experience and if you can afford it, you should take advantage of it.

Amazing!","5","2007-06"
"The Best","Not sure what I can say about this hotel, other than OUTSTANDING!!! We were here for 2 nights, and spoilt rotten!
The room was superb, I say room, but it’s actually a 2 storey apartment!!! 
You have your own butler to serve you, you have a welcome drink, chocolates, cakes, and nibbles in the room on arrival.
It was our anniversary and I was given a card, flowers and more chocolates.  Nice touch!!!

1ST FLOOR 
Huge living room - great views from windows
Study area
Bar area
Dining area
Huge hallway - with sweeping staircase
Guest bathroom
2ND FLOOR
Huge bedroom, huge bed, huge windows - great views once again
Large hallway with dressing table etc...
Enormous bathroom with his/hers vanity, hot tub, and a separate shower that you could 5 people in. 

Out of the room, if you ever want to leave it, the restaurants are great. On our 1st night we went to the skybar, we had good food and good service.  
The 2nd night we ate in the room and that was nice, really good food and super service.
The pool area is nice if a little small but, they have a private beach area which is lovely.
I just wished I could have stayed longer - I just have to save up to go back!","5","2007-09"
"What a hotel!","We recently spent 3 days in Dubai and our first night was at the Burj.  This was the end of our honeymoon after having spent 3 weeks in Southern Africa.  They say this is the only 7 star hotel in the world and now I know why!  Unbelievable experience and well worth the money. 

The lobby is gorgeous and the hotel features a great spa, squash courts, pools etc...The rooms are stunning.  Each one is a 2 story suite.  Everything is controlled with a remote control (i.e blinds on the windows even).  Each room has a laptop with internet connection, personal fax line and many flat screen televisions.  You have a butler that can help with anything (he even offered to help us pack on our last day!).  The hotel went above and beyond since it was our honeymoon and surprised us with a delicious chocolate cake and cheeses in the afternoon.  They also made a huge heart of rose petals on the bed for us.

You must make sure to check out the bar on the top floor which has incredible views of the city.  The ""underwater"" seafood restaurant was good, but not great.  The slightly cheesy submarine ride down to the restaurant was mildly entertaining.  Note that men must wear a jacket and slacks or traditional arab clothes to eat there.  Our butler kindly lent me a jacket and I had to buy slacks (we had casual clothes since we had been trekking through Africa for most of the trip).  I tried to find the arab clothes however every place I went to tailored them so I ended up buying pants :)

On thing to note is that in August it is HOT there.  Temperatures hit 51 C (120+ F) and it was humid.  The ocean was way too hot to be enjoyable so we ended up sticking to the pools at the hot which are cooled.  

All in all beautiful hotel and great experience.  I suggest spending at least 1 night there when in Dubai, well worth it.","5","2007-08"
"Burj 11 Nights","First visited the burj for three nights several years ago, was so impressed booked 11 night stay with my wife and eight year old child.,
Everything was excellent, food, suite and staff. Spent several wonderful afternoons in Aswan Spar, Dined in all venues.. The food in the underwater venue was best ever. Made great friends with another British couple, as we do not drink found meal a little pricey at £900 for the four of us. (well you only live once!) Have stayed at most of the top hotels around the world, I think this is the best. Ive booked to go to Emirates Palace.... will let you know how it compares.
Enjoy......SK","5","2005-08"
"The Best Hotel Experience","I recommend staying at the Burj Al Arab for at least one night to experience the wonderful staff, beautiful hotel and wonderful ocean views. 
The hotel is so different to anything I have ever stayed in and if I could afford to stay there again I would.
My husband and I were on our last leg of an around the world holiday and loved the pampering we got from the staff at this hotel. We were overjoyed when we got there and was told we would be upgraded to a two bedroom suite. I was thrilled by our butler and the room service we received. 

10 out of 10 in my book.","5","2006-04"
"Burj, the good and the bad","Love: the 2 storey suites in all rooms, the personalized service like kids size robe slippers if you bring kids, the different sets of goodies they bring to your room every night, hermes collection of free soaps perfumes and others, the great view of the ocean, the free buggy ride and entrance to Wild Wadi waterpark, the pools and gym.

Hate: 
- the butler service: they almost always bother you with things you don't ask for or need, and they just stand there expecting tips until we dismiss them.
- one of the worst concierges in a 5 star hotel: they misinformed me about a local tour I booked through them, and I had to be the one calling them instead of them telling me if the tickets are ready or not. 
-  bellhop takes forever, and you have to keep calling them so that they'd come.","4","2007-12"
"needs to try harder!!!","weve stayed at this hotel on a few occasions and although the architecture still retains the wow factor the staff do not!
we are not fussy travellers but i do require value for money and good service which you do not get it in the burj!

the rooms are clean and well maintained, the food is good but overpriced along with the wine.
depending on the nationality of the staff the service is hit and miss.
the floor concierge are lazy and the room service needs to be booked well in advance.
checking out is carried out by the gestapo!!
i wouldnt dare nick a dressing gown or cheat the minibar but the ""butlers"" rush around checking everthing making you feel decidedly uncomfortable which is a bad ending to your stay. 
everytime ive checked out ive had items on my bill that were incorrect so beware.
in short, hotels must improve year on year and not rest on the fictitious 7 star status and guests too awestruck to notice the drop in general customer service which is constant in the worlds top hotels.
i feel that all businesses should be trying to improve constantly and the burj has not. if the hotel wants to call itself 7* it had better up the game or as most reviews state it will be a ""once in a lifetime"" experience.

the real problem is its still the best overall hotel ive ever stayed in and ill probably go back!!!","4","2007-08"
"An experience we'll never forget!","Well what can we say that hasn't already been said about the Burj?
We booked through Amex - got the free brekkie, free massage late check out and upgrade if avialable. 
We spent 7 nights at the Mina Salem - our last night was to be at the Burj - the Mina called ahead to let the Burj know that we were coming - and off we went on the buggy. When we arrived we were greated warmly and checked in - to a 2 bedroom suite - so we got our upgrade.
We got there at 11.30am and our suite was ready and waiting for us - we loved our tour of the hotel, loved looking up into that big atrium, but were eager to finally see the famous suites. So in we went - well we were staggered - as everyone said we would be. The suite was 3,000 square foot! 2.5 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms, 1 bar area, 1 dinning room (with 6 seater table), 1 living room and a wonderful spiral staircase. Our floor to ceiling windows looked out over palm island - which was great as it really gave us perspective over the whole massive project. We also had 4 plasma tv's - yes we used them all.
We too enjoyed all the freebies - the dates, cheesey nibbles and the sweet nibbles, the bottle of wine, all the Hermes toiletries, the slippers, the flip flops and the beach bag - and yes we brought quite a few pieces home with us! Why not - we paid enough for our 1 night!
Anyway after all the suite expolration - we headed down to the pool -  very nice sun loungers, great service - interesting other guests - good people watching place. I actually spent quite a lot of time in the hot tub - nice and relaxing not too hot and gets the sun in the afternoons.
We had a lovely lunch by the pool - then went up to the sky bar to watch the sunset and look at the amazing views- have to say that  the sky bar was very oddly decorated - kind of distracted you from the view!
Back down in our suite nice Mr Butler had delivered a cheese plate which we enjoyed very much whilst we tried out the 2 whirlpool jacuzzi's!
Next morning we had the buffet breakfast which was delicious - not sure how much it would cost normally - it was part of our package. As we had late check out we were able to have our room till 4pm - which was great as we had a late flight that night, so we spent another day by the pool and then headed up to the spa - had a great massage and really enjoyed hanging out in the pool area looking at the twinkling lights of Dubai.
The Burj really was everything we thought it would be - over the top almost gaudy but yet somehow managing to stay amazing and non tacky. There were plenty of people flashing their cash but also plenty of people like us - just there for the experience. I reccomend it - for a once in a lifetime stay. Would we go back - maybe if we had new people to take with us - i really think thats the beauty of it - your first memorable visit.","4","2007-11"
"Toooooo much","I stayed at the Burj Al Arab in late November for a couple of nights with my wife and young family. It’s a bit of a curates egg to be honest. There are aspects which are fantastic –the architecture, the size of the suites, the location and so on. Yet there are many other which frankly leave room for improvement and are just high end 4* rather than the claimed 7*.  The English of the staff is not universally great, the price of the room service and mini bar is truly hideous, verging on the comic frankly, the in room décor is ‘idiosyncratic’—you might call it Versace to the Max, the TV sound quality was very bad in my room, sometimes getting things done took an age (tho at other times it was amazingly quick and efficient).

One of the highlights was the resort beach which was manicured and clean with a good restaurant and (kid) friendly staff. The rest of the resort is not kid friendly (certain restaurants are disallowed) which I do not mind/respect even though I am often travelling with a young family. 

The place is clearly a stop off point for the more money than sense crew (and I include myself in that category..) but its also a place where you’d be a very particular person if you were to return frequently. I do not mean that in a negative way simply that it is a self selecting crowd which is 

I’d say go here for 1 night only and then go for the Jumeirah Beach over the road. Make sure you take a moment to grab the complimentary and fantastic complimentary toiletries…I’m so cheap..","4","2007-11"
"Suspend disbelief, and your usual tastes...","This place is everything that the previous reviewers say it is.  We stayed for 3 nights in early October.

Magnificent, gaudy, decadent, opulent, extraordinarily expensive and an absolute indulgence.

Once you overcome your immediate response to the loud colours and gold accents, you begin to understand that the decor of the Burj really works.  If it were done in muted tones and had modern lines it would be considered as cold and ordinary.  It is what it has to be to fulfil our concept of the excesses of Arabian wealth.

No matter what you think of the decor, the service is impecable.  The suites are breathtaking - ours (911?!) was a panoramic suite situated on a corner of the Burj providing us with view out toward the gulf as well as back toward the beach club.  

The bed and the pillows (after selecting appropriate ones from the pillow menu) were by far the most comfortable we had on our entire trip.  Our 3 yr old was entranced by the mirror over the bed (yep- one of those touches that some of us could have done without). The free amenities and the bathroom were amazing, and the children's Sinbad pack was a real hit with our little girl.

The beach was fantastic - nothing like heading in for a swim and returning to a champagne bucket filled with bottles of chilled water and Evian sprays to keep us cool.

My husband and I dined at Al Muntaha after cocktails in the Skyview Bar.  Incredible food and wine and by far the most expensive meal we have ever had - which is saying something after a mis-order at Rockpool in Sydney several years ago which resulted in an extremely expensive bottle of Penfolds being consumed with our meal.  We did, however, drink French Champagne and wine and both of us had the Wagyu for main course (sensational).

Our daughter was very happy back in the suite being waited on hand and foot by the ""babysitter"" that we had hired for her.  Note to parents - babysitting charges at the Burj are really reasonable especially when compared to the prices we paid in London.

One criticism - the staff should be discouraged from offering chocolates to cute little blond 3yr old girls who are wandering around the complex. The amount of times I had to say ""no""!

Give yourself over to the Burj and you'll have a fabulous time (just don't look at the bill 'til you get home)!","5","2007-10"
"really good, did not really like the other guests","Stayed for 2 days on a return from the holiday at the Seychelles (husband, wife, boy). 

Was the second stay after some years. Was not quite as flamboyant, tacky and bombastic as remembered. The architecture is still stunning, the service still is really excellent, the rooms are spacious and the view is truely great. The food was this time -earlier reviews had complained- very good, excellent indeed. The chef has changed recently we were told.

What appears to have changed is the sociology of the guests. A hotel's character is mainly defined by its guests. Our impression was that the hotel now sells itself in packages. At breakfast we have seen an astonishing frequency of ultrashort shorts, cheap T-shirts, bathroom sandals and inadequate table manners. The majority of breakfast guests evidently has really worked for the money they spent at the Burj. Those guests, however, which one would immediately
associate with a hotel like the Burj probably had breakfast up in their rooms. 

The hotel has guided tours for visitors. Looking at guests is included. The hotel is an ideal place for wow! and amazing! shreekers. Experienced and demanding travellers would go there just once, for the sake of it, but subsequently they would seek for a a more exclusive and discreet place. These places exist in Dubai.","5","2007-10"
"Wow!","As a treat to end our holiday in Dubai to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday I booked the Burj for our final night on a B&B basis after staying at Dar al Masyaf.  After being greeted and asked to wait in the lobby we were escorted to our room.  We were upgraded to a Panoramic suite (612) as it was my husbands birthday.  All I can say is WOW, the suite was huge with business centre, bar area, huge lounge with sofas dining table and sweeping staircase upto bedroom.  The bed was huge, sep dressing area and bathroom with jacuzzi, shower, his and her sinks and complementary Hermes toiletries (full size).  The butler shows you around the suite and how to use the remote which you can do everything with.  He then came back with his boss and another butler with a chocolate birthday cake for my husband and 12 red roses for me and sang happy birthday much to my husbands embarrassment.  His boss said he would come back and show us around the hotel, as a special treat he took us up to the Royal Suite, if you think the lobby is OTT!  Had a meal at Al Muntha which was nice if a bit pricey.  The hotel is truely luxurious and a once in a lifetime experience which we thoroughly enjoyed and was the perfect end to a perfect holiday.","5","2007-09"
"Expectations Exceeded","We booked the Burj Al Arab for a special occasion. We felt at first that it was a little over priced for a one night stay with no breakfast included. 

We have lived with the Burj in our view for almost a year now, however only once you pass security and onto the bridge that connects it to the main land,  you truly appreciate its majesty. 

On arrival, we had some delay problems due to not bringing our Passport's with us, however after stamping my feet a little the matter was promptly and amicably resolved. The decor on first look is brash but it is very fitting and really does grow on you. 

We had the standard room on the third floor. Now we have stayed in a lot of world class hotels but this room was a monster. It really is hard to describe this epic. Panoramic views of the ocean on both levels, remote operated curtains, Bubble bath, a list to choose your pillows, complimentary Dates, Treats, Fruit, Water, Hermes products, slippers, bags the list goes on. 

Strange however it did not feel like a hotel but instead home, a feeling we have never had from any other accomodation. It is the first time I have been truly sad to leave a venue. 

Whoops almost forgot. Food: The underwater seafood place look amazing but we dont like seafood. The place on the 27th floor next to the Bar is well ugly as sin, this rooms decor can not be forgiven and can only be compared to a Bingo Hall from the UK at $300 a head (No Thanks) Instead we had our butler book us into the Mexican (Go West) in one of the ajoining hotels. Brilliant food, great drinks and it was all a blur from there apart from the suprise bath I had the butler pour for the wife on return, rose petals throught the room, soft music playing and a bottle a of bubbly. 

One warning however. While the Glass says "" Has been triple protected so no one can see in"" that does not apply at night when drunk and naked with the room lights on :)","5","2007-09"
"An experience to tell your friends","Burj is undoubtedly a landmark in Dubai.  The hotel has been packaging itself very successfully.  The high price makes it accessible to the prestigious few.  Yet people are attracted to the hotel as they expect it should be an experience that cannot be missed as long as they can afford.  

I booked Burj through their official website as I could not find any deals in other sites.  The price is around US$1000++ for one night during June.  I arrived at Dubai late in the evening and I chose to stay at Jumeirah Beach Hotel just opposite to Burj and moved to Burj the next morning.  As Jumeirah Beach and Burj are sister hotels, the move was smooth.  Jumeirah Beach arranged a free car to bring us over to Burj the next day.

The decor of Burj is impressive but I cannot say it is the most beautiful hotel I've ever been.  Bold colors are used all over the hotel - royal blue, red, yellow, gold, green, etc.  All rooms are suites with two levels.  The ""complimentary"" items may easily cost US$300 out of the room rate (see picture):
1. Beach bag
2. Beach sandals x 2
3. Red wine from Australia
4. French bottled water
5. A box of savory snacks
6. A box of dates
7. A box of local cookies
8. A box of french macaroon
9. Hermes toiletries - full set, full size: soap, cologne, shampoo, conditioner, deordorant, female & male
10. Huge fruit basket

A Siemens central control system is installed which controls the blinds, TV, tel, lights, etc.  However, the TV was out of order throughout our stay and the blinds are too noisy.   Arabian scents are sprayed inside the lifts but the smell is too strong to non- arabians like me.

We had lunch at the famous ""underwater"" seafood restaurant , Al Mahara.  The ""submarine"" trip to the restaurant is a disappointing gimmick.  The seafood is fresh but taste is only mediocre at this price.  The lunch costed US$500 per person without wine.  Our friends which were staying at other hotels joined us for lunch in Burj only wanted to see the hotel.  They were only allowed inside the hotel 30 minutes before the booking.  This is again a clever trick of the hotel which makes guests feel prestigious.

The stay is AN EXPERIENCE but I think I may not go back for a second time.  I would even say staying there one night for the experience is enough.  Service is good but not excellent.  No need to try the restaurant as you can find better seafood anywhere at this price.

"7th heaven","This has got to be if not one the best hotels i have ever stayed in.

From the moment they pick you up at the airport to the time you leave.. you are in luxury...

We stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel is par excellence.

We were picked up at the airport in a BMW 7 series..the hotel is a good 30 minutes drive away from the airport.. they have menu for the music cds available in car..

as soon as enter the hotel you are greated with dates and juice.

we stayed in the king deluxe suite (The hotel has only suites) and it was huge duplex room with an amazing view of the ocean.

The remote control (to be used for opening curtains, managing tv and opening door) is very cool..

The personal butler service was great..

The room and the bathroom were excellent - the best you can see in a hotel.

the service waa brilliant .. you want something just ask the butler and it would be done..they even offered my wife to unpack and pack her bags..

the burj does not have its own beach but shares it with its other jumeriah hotels jumeriah beach and madinat jumeriah..we went to the madinat jumeriah and it is quite a good beach..

the only negative thing about the hotel is its pool. which i thought was very small...for a hotel of that grandeur...

The food is brilliant.. we had breakfast at the poolside restaurant and dinner once at the buffet restaurant..we could not go their signature restuarent as they were upgrading their submarine and even though the restaurent was open and could be reached through elevators we opted not to go for it..

the location of the hotel is also great as it is 5 minutes drive away from the mall of emirates..

in all a amazing hotel to stay in..would highly recommend.

"A subjective review","I had read about this hotel many times and now, I can give my personal opinion.

The architectural is fantastic, if you are interested in it at all. The rooms, which are all suites, 202 all together
I have read past reviews that the decor was ""tacky and tastless"". Not true.  Done in a very ""arabesque"" way, full of glitter, gold and strog blues, ochre colors. Brass seems to be the most important element.  They manage to achieve harmony within a style we, from the west, are not acostumed to. We must be subjective.The rooms were well designed, even though I am more of a minimalist person. So, I give thumbs up for the room s(apartment). 

The service is a bit intense, having one butler at your services 24 hours per day. Extremely nice people and they are here to please you. I would have prefered to have less staff around....

The restaurants are nicely done, one being on top of the hotel and the other on the main floor wich contains a huge fish tank...somewhat impressive. However, I found the prices to be ofensive, when they charge close to US$70 for a burger  by the pool or a US$40 for a tiramisu. Regardless how much money one have, I find it very difficult to eat at any of their restaurants and pay the exorbitant prices. I am a chef and know the cost of food. In the US you can dine in the best restaurants and any 5 star hotels and will never pay the prices of the Burj. The rooms start at US$ 1,000 per night, in which I think they are well worth the money...but the restaurants simply putting it, is a rip off. The food was good but not extraordinary.

The swimming pool (outdoors) is small but since I am here in the low season it seems fine. Even though the temperature outside is above 40 celcius, they manage to keep the water ""cool""...well done. Also there is another pool on the 18th floor where the gym is. Nice size and excellent views.  Hope this review will be of some help to the curious ones

"Out of this world","What can you say about the Burj. The first word that comes to mind is WOW. 
We went there last year as part of our honeymoon. After visiting Penang, Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia this was the absolute icing on the cake. We arrived early in the morning and were greeted by a member of staff at the airport. This actually guaranteed an express service through the airport. We had booked a Rolls Royce to pick us up from the airport .. after all it was our honeymoon. We informed the hotel about the early arrival in advance but they did not guarantee an early check-in. However, when we got there about 6.30AM they checked us straight in. Brilliant. I was so excited I could hardly sleep. Our butler offered to empty our suitcases but I did not want him to. As they knew that it was our honeymoon, they gave us this gorgeous chocolate cake and some gorgeous roses. There were always fresh flowers in the room. There are loads of other things in the room from the Hermes products which you can take home to a selection of sweets. There was something else on the bed every night from chocolates to little toiletries. You also got different canpees every night before going out. 
The food in the hotel is brilliant. You have got two different restaurants where you can have breakfast. We also tried the Sky Bar and Restaurant. Food is brilliant and the views are amazing. We also went to the Seafood Restaurant, which can be reached by buggy or you can walk. It is part of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel but as a guest of the Burj you are also welcome. We went there before and it was great. One lunchtime we decided to have a buffet lunch on the second level of the hotel lobby. It was very expensive (£50 a head) .... but it was seafood and we only noticed the price when we got the bill. 
I can't comment on the hotel pool as we never used it but with a gorgeous beach who needs to ... white sand ..... clear water and the service at the beach second to none. You get fresh water all the time and the waiters come round with little fruit shoots and cold towels for your face.
Someone said that you pay for what you get. That's true but it is so much worth it. I want to go back but probably have to save up for a while.
Spacious luxurious accommodation, superb food, friendly staff, a gorgeous beach ..... what else could you ask for?
","5","2006-09"
"You pay for the experience","It would be useless to try and come up with superlatives beyond what everyone has said.

I used the opportunity to stay here to celebrate my daughter's birthday and it didn't disappoint - right down to the extra effort made for her and the unbelievable chocolate mouse cake they sent for her.  The place is spectacular in every sense of the word..

Having said that, you are paying for the experience . . . the ""hey, I stayed there"" type of thing.  It was, most likely, a once-in-a-lifetime stay as once you get past all the overwhelming sensations it substantially reduces what I would pay again.

But, for those looking for the experience I recommend it.

"I  Loved The Burj. I  Am Dreaming To COme Back Soon.","We had a great time this July visiting this  fabulous hotel. What can  I  say!  From  the meeting at the airport with the Burj representatives  and passing the customs  as VIPS to the transfer to the hotel with their Rolls Royce  and  when we arrived  everything was out of this world, the architecture of the hotel was so impressive, the service  excellent , our  butler  Ashan  was perfect.  As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary,  I  do not remember how many bouqouets  of roses they brought  us. I loved the Hermes products they gave us.The restaurants were fantastic. The Assawan Spa was magnificent. After staying  at  Soneva Gili and Hilton Rangali in the Maldives   I finished my trip with a stay at Burj.We are now seeing our videos  taken from this trip and  we are looking forward to staying at Burj again.
","5","2007-07"
"Go...just for the experience!","Very hard to say exactly what is most odd about the Burj.  Perhaps its the very strict security just to get in to try and spend money.  Perhaps its the most gaudy clash of colours in the known world.  Perhaps its because you are sitting on a plot of reclaimed sand, out from a city that is sitting on sand and staring at huge developments built on, well....sand.   Anyway, back to the Burj...surely on no planet  does red, blue, green, yellow and HUGE amounts of gold go together....Arab chic? Once over the visual assault we travelled to the 27th floor restaurant for lunch, guess what...even more colours and patterns were introduced.  It has to said, the experience of eating in the worlds only 7 star hotel left a very major dent in the credit card, but it really does have to be done.  Its just one of those great stories to tell your friends and the food really is quite special.  Beautifully presented, fragrant, full of taste and delivered by exceptionally attentive staff.  To get into the bar or restaurant you have to book ahead a few days, and then get through bank-vault-like security, but definitely go to the Burj for lunch or cocktails, I couldnt get used to the rainbow display of colour where we were, I dare not think what the rooms are like.  Apparently if you remortgage your house you can even stay at the hotel proper and you get your own butler.","4","2007-07"
"wonderful...over the top, but just great","We booked a stay of 5 nights at the Burj after getting a good deal through an on-line travel agent. I would like to point out that the price didn't matter though, as the service was superb.

Our only grumble was the food in the under-sea restaurant, but as this is the worlds only 7 star hotel we shouldn't really. I really enjoyed the food upstairs in the 70's style disco restaurent overlooking the sea. Make sure you book before the sun goes down to enjoy this one to the full.

Anyways, service : fantastic

Rooms : even the cheapest suite is amazing

use of facilities : great

food: even the buffet breakfast choice couldn't be bettered.

anyway, I think you get my drift.

Use of the hotel allows full use of the sister hotels/facilities, and will give you free access to the water park (I say free, but in fact they give you free towels, and a token worth 20 dm to use in the park to buy food & drinks, so in fact they pay you to go, and take you everywhere in their fleet of buggies.

Fantastic hotel

Great people.

Enjoy it. You will never get better.

Anywhere.

"Seven Stars","You know you are having a good day when you are met on arrival at the airport by your driver (with roses) and escorted to the house Bentley for a ride to Indesputably the finest Hotel anywhere. The rooms and views are jaw dropping, the food is amazing, and the service aaahhhhh. Everything about this hotel is over the top and the staff completes the experience with their perfect service. The dining is flawless whether it be in-room, beachside, the underwater fantasy of Al Mahara, or floating up at Al Muntaha. The fruit bowl in our private Dining Room was a perfect still life of Dragon fruit from Vietnam, and other assorted treasures. Every single aspect of the Burj experience delights all the senses-the materials used (exotic stone of every imaginable color, glorious tile and furnishings etc.), the fresh floral ""sculptures"", the staggering aquariums, the tasteful boutiques! I especially loved the large opulent but still
human scaled bathrooms with full size his & hers super primo toiletries. Don't miss the Spa and Pool of your dreams....outstanding! Put the Burj at the top of things to see in your lifetime and while you're there see all that Dubai has to offer.

"The Best Hotel In The World By Miles","Stayed at the Burg for a week in the club suite in late May, the suite is massive , with full size snooker Table, and a full size cocktail bar, also there is a full size kitchen/ the furnishings are all top quality.
When we landed at the airport , we where fast tracked through customs, Then the driver of the Rolls Royce Phantom then met us, gave us cold towls, and some water, then we where given a choice or which cds we wanted to listen to ,on the way to the Burg
we then where met by three of the hotel staff, offering us dates, water, and towels, then we where taken to the 19th floor, where are butler met us, and showed us all the around the suite, and going through the key pad, which opens the curtains, CD player etc. The staff could not do enough for you, Like little pressys on your pillow each night, Also when you come in from the pool or beach. the butler comes in and give you lovely canapas, and drinks. we ate  at all restraunts, and the food and service where ttop notch, Not to forget all the free hermes products, the the high quality beach bag, flip flops and two pairs of slippers you get, which you can take home. there are buggies that take you all the madinat complex, bliss. we hired a boat for an hour to look around the palm island and marina, which will be out of this world when it is finished.NOW the burg at just bought a yact which is called BURG 1 we where very lucky and had a tour of the boat very impressive, and we where told they are looking for a BIGGER BOAT. We also went to the general Manager cocktail  party on the 18th floor champayne all the way, with lovely canapas . we also ate at  the jumeirah beach hotel, which was superb. My BUTLER showed me around the ballroom which was out of this world, also i was shown the board room, with views which were breathtaking, I Can honestly say this was  the best experience i have ever had, and if you can stay, because it is the best hotel in the world

"Stayin' at the Burj...","My wife and I booked a stay at the Burj for two nights in late July 2007.  If you want the quick and dirty: it's pricey and I truly don't think it's worth it.

Prior to leaving, I hadn't been contacted on how I would be met at the airport. They hadn't even sent email asking when I would arrive. I called the limo service at the Burj and asked if we were going to be picked up. 

Would you like the Rolls Royce or the BMW?

He's asking me? Who would pass up a ride in a Rolls Royce Phantom??  But wait...why is he asking me such an obvious question?

Do you charge additional for airport pick-ups?

Yes, sir. The Phantom is 1200 AED and the BMW is 300. 

Needless to say, the BMW was a good ride. :P
+++++
Arrived at the airport (which we had to walk for about 20 minutes from the plane to customs, by the way) and were met by a Burj representative right before customs. He was very cool and let us know where to meet him after customs.

Customs was quick and so was bag pick-up. We went out to find our driver to no avail. We had to stop at the Jumeirah desk to ask them where to go. About one minute later another driver came and picked us up.

The ride over was very nice. Our driver was kind (of course) and met my wife with a nice multi-colored bouquet of roses and some cold hand cloths.  We were given a book with about 10 choices of CDs to listen to on the 40-minute trip. Along the way, our driver gave us little tidbits of information about the buildings in Dubai and the Burj. Good stuff.

Once at the hotel (which really does look fantastic), we were met by staff members that set us down in the lobby, gave us more hand cloths and some dates to try while they grabbed our baggage to take to the room. I paid for the two nights stay (which they flagged 10000 AED on my credit card for) and off we were to the room.

I thought the room was a bit over-done, frankly- a little tacky with the colors- but it was very comfortable. A remote control handled everything in the suite to include the curtains, tv and front door, etc. 

Our butler, James, showed us around the suite, explaining everything and before leaving, we asked him to set up a jacuzzi bath for us.  James was amazing during our stay.  Any question we had, he answered very precisely. 

The room did have cool amenities like free Hermes after shave and cologne for men and some perfume for women. We had fresh fruit every day.  They had a very nice laptop with very fast internet.

Food.  Each morning we ate the breakfast buffet- it was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary.  I think it was about 180 AED per person, but can't remember.  We ate in Al Mahara, the restaurant with the large aquarium. My wife and I are sincerely people that are easy to impress, but the food was not all that great. I think we paid about 1200 AED.  Service was good and it was fun to look at the tank from time to time. If you eat there, you'll probably get a visit from George, one of the fish that constantly hovers over each table- pretty cute! We didn't eat anywhere else and I regret not trying out Al Muntaha on the 27th floor.

All in all, the Burj was a fun experience. After we left- and stayed at Al Qasr just next door- we realized that the Burj actually felt like home- not like a hotel room. It genuinely felt like our place. That's a very unique experience for only two days. Yet, I still feel it was too pricey.  The room, food and tipping costs were pretty significant.

So! Hope this helps! It's nice to be pampered, but it's gonna cost you!

"Just OK","My husband and I spent two nights in a Panoramic Suite #1312.  We booked this stay last minute through American Express and paid $1500USD/night.  There was nothing about this stay that was worth that price.  We spent the first 4 hours with the IT people trying to get the WiFi service to work in the room...as my husband had to communicate with his office.  The view was fantastic, but I felt the suite almost tended towards tacky, it was so overdone.  There was alot of gold, and cool electric sunshades, but when the people in the suite next to us raised or lowered their sunshades, it was very loud in our suite.

The butler service was pretty attentive, but I don't really see it as an added value to the stay.

The pool areas were overcrowded and there were not alot of attendants tending to guests.  

My advice is don't book more than one night.  The hotel will not let you leave early without paying for the full stay...and I have a feeling many guests try to do this.  Another odd thing about this hotel....we pre-paid the room, but when we checked in, the butler asked for our credit card, and brought us back a receipt explaining that they had blocked out $3000 UAE for incidental charges.  I have never seen a hotel block a specific amount for charges.  We moved from the Ritz Carlton in Dubai which did not block my credit card for incidental charges.  I almost have to wonder if alot of their guests overspend on the $100 breakfasts, $200 lunches and $300 dinners and can't pay the bill?  

Try one night and if you love it, then extend your stay.

"Fantastic Burj Al Arab","My wife and I stayed in the Burj Al Arab for the start of our honeymoon, and didn't really know what to expect having read varying reviews on Trip Advisor. 
Needless to say, when we eventually arrived and checked into our Panoramic Suite, we were not disappointed at all. 
It all starts at the airport where you are greeted by the Jumeirah representative - they are extremely friendly and move you through passport control with little or no delays. 
From there, the cars are superb and you are whisked to the Burj in air-conditioned comfort. 
We arrived early (8am) and we had to wait a while for the room - that was a bit of a pain but worth the wait. 
We were taken up to the Panoramic Suite on the 14th floor, and it was fantastic. Great views, massive room, free toiletries and other accessories, BOSE IPOD docking station - absolutely super. 
Staff could not have been more helpful and the Guest Services desk on each floor make sure everything that can be done for you and you have no hassles at all. 
Private beach is great with the staff there being so friendly and courteous. 
Prices - definitely high for food and drinks. 
Al Mahara - still not sure about this restaurant - food was excellent and service first rate, but we had dinner at Verre the night afterwards and enjoyed that more. 
Overall, we are delighted that we chose to stay at the Burj and it lived up to our expectations. We will definitely stay there again for another special occasion.

"An amazing and stunning location","We have just returned from a one night stay in the Burj al Arab - what an amazing experience.  The hotel is stunning, the staff are so polite and respectful and the suites are out of this world.  We arrived at the hotel and as our room was not ready, we had an automatic upgrade to a two bedroomed suite - it was amazing with sweeping staircase, chandalier, to the upstairs bedrooms.  The butler took us on a guided tour, showed us how everything worked and was on call 24/7.  I would urge anyone thinking of staying to at least book just one night -  we will never forget the experience.

"Burj Al Arab - Honeymoon, Perfect","We had just arrived from our week stay in the Maldives at the Hilton Rangali Island and Resort, staying in a Water Villa.  This was an amazing experience with over double the amount of staff to the number of guests.

However the Burj Al Arab... Worlds Apart.  

We booked this hotel as we have travelled to many places and wanted this one to be very special... as it is our honeymoon.

On arrival at the airport, everything was taken care of, they collected our luggage, all we had to do was go through passport control.  We were collected by Rollys Royce and my wife was given a bunch of flowers and was asked to choose the music in the car.  We were given a couple of cold towels and some water.  On the way the driver was very down-to-earth and showed us some of the sights on the way to the hotel.  

Just after the Dubai Creek Golf Club, he rang the hotel and said, we are at Check Point 2.... Sure enough as we arrived at the hotel... we had no less than 8 people thanking us for coming and welcoming us to the hotel, offering beverages and dates, etc.

We were then escorted to our room, we had a Deluxe suite on the 20th Floor on 'The World' side of the hotel (however being hazy we dont know whether we are able to see The World or not).  However the view is towards the Burj Dubai (Soon to be the tallest building in the world).

All the suites are over 2 floors and the butler showed us around and how to work all the electronics, such as tv and the curtains all controlled by remote.  It is very overwhelming and the Hermes Toiletries smell lovely and of course they are yours.  

On arrival we were given a cake and a bottle of Champagne to celebrate our Honeymoon, together with a further bunch of flowers.  It was also my Birthday the following day so have had 2 further cakes and a bunch of flowers.... however to top this all off, we had the head butler, another butler and a muslim lady sing Happy Birthday to me... WITH A GUITAR.... Was very sweet....

We've eaten at the Al Muntaha Restaurant (review elsewhere on the site) and the buffet, which was 130GBP without alcohol... so a little expensive for what it is. 

Breakfast is 60GBP although is included, and is very comprehensive.  

All in all a truely special place and one you have to try.  

Maybe the next stage is the Hydropolis ( i think it is called) its the first Underwater Hotel in the world coming to Dubai soon.

"Wonder of the world?","Well...where shall i begin? After getting over the initial shock / surprise of my husband kindly booking this hotel for our honeymoon, getting through security and over the bridge to reach this spectacular hotel, walking into the ellaborate foyer was awe inspiring. From then on you are treated like royalty.  Not only do you get a butler who checks you in and follows you round from then on but you get taken to your bedroom which in most cases is spread over two floors and bigger than most houses in the UK.  Here I fell in love, I had two bathrooms, one of which had his and her sinks, showers, baths but also a walk in dressing room.  This of course along with your own living room and dining room, bedroom etc.

The little extra touches they add are quite sweet aswell.. bottle of non alcoholic bubbly, bowl of fruit, box of chocolates and dates, and a tv screen which had a special message for us both.  Everything is controlled by a remote.. i'm talking tv, curtains, lights and even the butler!  The view when opening the curtains is like something I have never seen before and probably never ever will.

This hotel is as romantic as you want to make it (I'm talking mirrored ceilings and pillow menu) yes, pillow menu...the least you would expect for the price...and you can like i did get the butler to fill the bath for you (whilst you are out exploring other areas of the hotel) with rose petals!

Excellent facilities, restaurants, spa, wonderful views from the pools- absolutely amazing!!!!! And one of the best massages I have ever had.  The only down side if you see it as that is that the hotel provides everything you need therefore you may not even want to leave the hotel and explore the rest of Dubai, even the Wild Wadi Park which is just opposite and included in the price

If you can even for one day, you should, just for the experience.  An experience I will never forget!

"Unbelivable and Spectacular","There is no Hotel like this one. It was expensive but worthwhile to stay at least once in lifetime. On its own manmade island, It is architectural marvel. Everything in this hotel is made specifically for this Hotel and everything is fabulous.

"Great experience!","On our way back to Singapore from Europe we experienced Burj Al Arab one night. It is the unofficial symbol of Dubai, a must see place for tourists, which represent the new soul and vision of Dubai. Most tourists visiting Dubai come to Burj, just to see, take photographs, perhaps have dinner or coffee in one of hotel's eateries. In a way we did the same, only one notch higher and we stayed there the night. Architecture is FANTASTIC, truly is monumental. Once you step in, here there is an endless ceiling rising above your head. Interior looks like a huge beehive with whitewashed balconies and colorful walls. Two amazing beehive pools at the entrance display various colors. Playful water hoops jump up and down, play hide and seek with each other. I shouldn't forget to mention the two huge aquariums on the sides of the escalators. Walking towards the hotel after sunset is quite an experience. Front wall of the hotel must be fabric, creates an illusion of a huge lamp glittering with red and orange. It is like a huge, modern magic lamp.  During the day it looks like a sail, I think that's the illusion they were trying to create. I loved it. Our room was great too, In fact we were upgraded to a corner suite. 7-8m high ceiling was very impressing. On both sides of the room, the walls are completely glass. It is possible to see famous ""The World"" project rising up in Persian Golf on one side and on the other side there is the beach, more turquoise water, Jumeirah complex and the water park. Upon entering the room, there is a study area right across and long stairs climbing up to the mezzanine bedroom. Once turning left, here there is a huge living area with a dining table and private bar. Up on the mezzanine level, there is a huge bed and a pillow menu to choose from. Two toilets, one is up one is downstairs. 2 huge TVs, jacuzzi, shower place, dressing area, 2 sets of slippers, and many more, everything you might need and best quality, luxurious. Lots of gold and dark blue. I probably wouldn't decorate my house like this, but it is a different, fun  experience. There is a butler service, though butler changes frequently. He teaches how to use the equipment and brings lots of itsy bitsy snacks, fruits etc to the room. So you kind of feel the need to put the don't disturb sign on outside. But this is not easy, it is electronic and to use it, you need to know how to operate the super techie remote. If you haven't listened to the butler carefully you might be in trouble like me. Fortunately my husband remote savvy enough we managed to solve this minor problem. All these plenty is nice but might be a bit tiring at times, so take it easy. As mentioned by other reviewers room service and restaurants are very expensive. Food we ordered for room service was not all that good, restaurant food was good but there is nothing to write home about it. There is a subtle cheekiness among the stuff. I don't know how to describe it. Perhaps not genuinely respectful is the way to describe? I actually felt this in almost everywhere in Dubai. Perhaps it is a cultural thing. Dubai is the land of mega, modern, techie, chic projects and it is under construction. It might be an interesting place once complete. We are planning to go back there again in 5 years.

"Fantastic Stay at Burj Al Arab!","Recent stay at the Burj was beyond description. There are no words to describe the opulence, luxury and service.  It is well worth the price to treat yourself as if a King with every one of your needs are taken care of  by a Personal Butler, Floor Concierge and staff.  It is so elegant.

The room was 3200 sqft, (300sqm) 2 stories and fully furnished with luxurious accomodations.  The butler brings fresh fruit & fresh flowers to your room everyday and spends time to listen to your needs. Anything and everything you need is all taken care of.  (The Butler noticed that I used a pencil to write some notes, so the next day, I found the pencil sharpened!)  Need a booking for Dinner?  It's done! Seems when you have the Burj Access Card, people outside the Burj go out of their way to be of assistance.  One of the floor Concierge whom I hadn't yet met, greeted me by name when I returned from the afternoon out.  I was impressed. It was like they memorize everyone on their floors, what you like, dislike, personal assistants if you will.

With the Burj access card you have complete access to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, Wadi Water Park and Madinat Jumeirah complexes and facilities, pools etc.. The Burj has it's own Luxury outdoor pool, 2 pools on the 18th floor, fitness center that is equipped to extreme, shops, restaurants (expensive), all was made for a king!  Restaurant on the 27th floor has a breathtaking view of the Palms Jumeirah.  Food and service was 5 star and expensive but well worth the experience.

I will save my money and stay longer next time.  Once in a lifetime experience for many!!! Oh I forgot to say....what a beautiful piece of architecture inside and out.  My vision of life in the 23rd Century","5",
"Impossible to live up to it's hype","We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights recently in a Panoramic Suite. First of all the negatives - 1) we had arranged to be picked up at the airport but on arrival nobody was there - a long story but in summary - we waited 30 minutes outside in the heat, had to call the hotel 3 times, get back into the airport through a no entry door and go to the Jumeira counter (ie. not flagged as a Burj Al Arab counter)
to demand some action. Our 'greeter' then materialised and had apparently been waiting at the wrong arrival gate. This was sympathetically remedied at the hotel as the price of the transfer was waived and some hotel wine offered as an apology but this was not
the start we had hoped for. 2) We had a lot of different butlers help
us over the 6 day stay - it became a bit tiring to be constantly introduced to ""our new butler"" and we would have preferred to have just 1 or 2 so that they would get to know us better. 3) The Al Arab is a luxury hotel and such service and quality is naturally expensive. However I found that the prices for everything was entirely disproportionate - USD80 for a room service hamburger, USD100+ for breakfast, USD500 for a full bottle of spirits in the room etc. etc. 4) The food was 'reasonable' but for example, in the flagship 'underwater' seafood restaurant, the seafood was not particularly fresh and the champagnes and wines we tasted had clearly
been damaged by heat or cork taint. 5) The bar on the top floor of the hotel felt extremely dated - in terms of design, decor, music, ambience - the atmosphere felt in contrast to the rest of the hotel - an odd experience and perhaps designed more for drop in visitors/tourists rather than hotel guests.

As for the positives - the website accurately represents the 'look' of the hotel. The interior and exterior will take your breath away. Although the furnishings are perhaps too opulent for some, the hotel certainly has an individual identity, and the suites themselves are extremely spacious and functional. The levels of service and cleanliness are meticulous and the Hermes products provided are of expected quality (please note however that the more 'expensive' products are not replaced everyday but every three days). The gym and pool are also of an expected high standard and are perhaps the only things that are free of charge in the hotel, with a great view to boot.

In summary - it is an enjoyable experience to stay at the Al Arab but I would caution that the hotel is by no means perfect and so expectations need to be realistic. We stayed at the Al Qasr in the adjacent complex and it's levels of service and refinement were almost the same at 1/3 of the price for the room and amenities (though with 1/3 of the space..). I feel that the room rate at the Al Arab is probably justified for the size of suite that one can enjoy but that the price of goods and services is wholly unrealistic and will turn many people off.","4","2007-05"
"Great Value Even at $1200 a Night","My Wife and I just came back from Dubai. We stayed 3 nights at the Burj and loved every minute of it.  The reception, staff, food, service, decor, attention detail are all as promised and hyped if not better.   Our price per night with tax was $1200 and that felt like a steal.  Last summer we stayed one night at the Mandarin Orietnal in NYC for our wedding anniversary where the total was about $950.  For the extra $250 at the Burj you get SO much more - the two story suite - free transportation around the Jumeirah beach area, personal attention, Hermes cosmetics, new food and amenities appearing in your room each night  - so many surprises every day and so welcoming.  We can't wait to go back.

"Does not live up to the hype","We spent twon nights here in transit through dubai , Going through dubai there seemed to be only one choice of hotel, but in the end the whole experience was rather tacky ... 

The suite was gigantic, we had over 300m of floorspace, which was all a bit too much, the extra bedroom for example was not realy needed, the style is basically over the top gaudy, and despite all the space you have no outside space so are stuck in the a/c environment the whole time .... 

They talked us into visiting the ""underwater"" restaurant which was all an enormous hassle, they started off telling me my shoes would not be acceptable so after going out and buying shoes they said , oh and you do have a jacket and tie ? , this being dubai a jacket is the last thing I expected to need but they lent me one and off we went in the phoney submarine , this should alert you to the fact that you are not heading to a quality dining experience .... the food was overpriced and too salty to be edible and overall very unimpressive ... 

My general view of places that impose dress codes are that they do this as an admission that their general clientele are not a classy bunch, in Tokyo I have never been to a restaurant with any dress code as people tend to dress well at all times, places like the burj can impose silly codes that annoy cutomers, but a jacket and shoes with laces are not going to prevent customers from being loud, annoying and poorly behaved ....

"The Best Hotel in the World","My Husband and I stayed at the Burj for three days in March 2006, loved it so much that we booked a week in May this year. It was wonderful. I would give it 10 stars.We booked one of the Hotel's Rolls Royces for our transfers to and from the airport which was probably cheaper than the same in England. We ate in the resturants which were expensive but the food and the service was out of this world. All the guests were treated as if they were special. It was worth every penny and thoroughly recommend it. I am returning in March, this time with our Daughter.
","5","2007-05"
"sheer bliss","we fllew to Dubai on the 13th of May and after a very good flight with Emirates were fast-tracked through the customs and arrivals procedures by a member of the Burj staff and into our Rolls Royce within 15 mins of landing. Our chauffeur had iced water waiting for us and also a selection of music and chilled hand towels. A great start. When we arrived at the Burj we were met by a number of staff and a reviving cold drink. Within minutes we were ushered into our suite on the 20th floor with the most remarkable views of the city . The suite was spotless! The furnishings are extremely elegant and everything is of the finest quality. Our concierge and Butler wanted to unpack for us but we declined as we were only going to be there for 3 nights and didn't need to empty the suitcases. However, the things that we did hang up were discretely whisked away the next morning whilst we were at breakfast and reappeared pressed! The staff could not have been more helpful if they had tried - in fact it is almost a problem trying to stop them! The restaurants were lovely nad met our expectations for quality of food, wine, service and price. If you cannot afford to go there with an open pocket - don't. We will go back again for the horse racing and are looking forward to it. We hired the Burj cabin cruiser for an afternoon and the Captain, Peter was extremely informative about all of the construction taking place in Dubai. We took a trip around 'the palm' and also went around 'the world' in 90 minutes ! That was a fantastic experience and one we will repeat. The day we left to fly to Mauritius we were sent off with lots of the Hermes products which you are given to use or not - as you wish and our transfer back to the airport was as seamless as our arrival. 10 out of 10 for everything.

"Staying at the Burj for the weekend!","To celebrite the landmark that was my 40th Birthday my wife and I decided to visit Dubai and stay at the Burj Al Arab.  Having reading reviews of varying degrees and spent a not inconsiderable amount of money on the trip I was somewhat apprehensive as to my stay.
However, I was pleasantly surprised that the Burj met and surpassed my expectations.  Firstly it is a marvelous structure both inside and out that is both captivating and awe inspiring.  On arrival, our welcome was warm and helpful and I was surprised by the serenity of the reception (I did not know at that time that access to hotel complex is controlled).  The staff were extremely helpful and polite without being overbareing or presumptious.  Each floor has it's own receptionist and butler to assist you and compliment your stay.  Understandably the rooms were kept to an impeccable standard and on arrival we were given a full demonstration of the facilities (Each standard room has a laptop with internet access and a multi-card memory reader - useful for viewing and send digital photo shots).  Complimentary wine and fruit were provided in the room.  We were advised by friends to purchase alcohol at the airport  in the duty free shop by the baggage collection area as not surprisingly food and drink are very expensive in the hotel.
I had read about the decor and some people's opinion of it as being tacky or gawdy.  In my opinion most of the attempts at replicating historic/stylistic decor in such places as Las Vegas do result in a tacky interior but I think the Burj just about manages to avoid that.  The finishings of the hotel in general and the rooms are to an excellent standard and while most of the styling is not what you would call subtle, it is also not overpowering or gawdy.  The space and views provided by the room were fantastic and are what I think what makes it stand apart from other hotels around the world.  It is more than a hotel room without being an apartment.  My favourite part of the hotel had to be the inifinity swimming pool located on the 18th floor.  Being able to swim while also viewing the sea and Dubai was very memorable.  There is also a small outdoor pool around which there is sunbathing.  The staff are extremely attentive when you want to sunbathe, laying out towels for you and providing iced water.  We did not try any of the restaurants in the hotel partly because they are very expensive but also because there are plenty of excellent options in the Madinat complex that adjoins the Burj (accessible via a compliment buggy service).  We did enjoy the Wild Wadi water party (complimentary to Burj guests)  and also the beach that is exclusive to the Burj.  
Overall we had an excellent stay in Dubai and the Burj.  Expensive as it is, I think it is worth it if you want to treat yourself.
","5","2007-05"
"Beautiful, but not Extraordinary... One stay is enough !","It was for my birthday surprise trip... 
My first impression of Dubai is that it looks just like Las Vegas, only with luxurious setting of the ocean.

We arrive in the evening. We could spot the hotel far away just before we arrive there. The hotel soars to a height of 321 meters, dominating the Dubai coastline, and until this time still one of the most expensive hotel in Dubai. 

Unlike the other hotel properties which are easy to access by visitor, Burj Al Arab grant access only to their overnight guests, guests who have reservation (either for restaurants or spa) and for their private members.
At the main gate, the security verify our name before allowed us to proceed to the hotel building.

The hotel lobby was impressive. I noticed more employee than the guest, which is one sign of the luxury property.
We were welcomed by the guest service agent, fresh towel and welcome drink were offered upon arrival. Shortly after collecting our travel documents, we were escorted to our suite on 24th floor.

Our 2 Bedroom Suite (Area - 335 sq. mts.) has a large dining area with separate kitchen and two lounges offering magnificent sea views - allowing us plenty of space to rest, relax or entertain in unsurpassed style. 

Lower level - Living room with large lounge area, dining table for 6, kitchen and separate butler entrance, small lounge, guest washroom, office with chess table 

Upper level - Master bedroom with king size bed and adjoining luxury bathroom and dressing room, second bedroom with twin beds and luxury bathroom.

We were introduced to our personal buttler, who gave tour to our suite as well as an explanation on how to use the all in one suite remote control (tv, light, audio, curtain, etc). 
I mostly impress by the room amenity, such as HERMES full size bath & body products, as well as fresh flower arrangements in the suites.
The other additional touch such as a laptop computer with free internet access in the suite is very useful (eventhough the laptop model is a bit old and the connection is a bit slow).
The Entertaiment selection on TV is wonderful, inclusive with free movie channel (don't expect any adult film... as it is forbid in the country). Beside the movie channel, there is also selection of dvds that can be deliver to your room (offcourse complimentary - but no new blockbuster film !).

The private beach at Burj Al Arab was excellent, less crowded then all other Jumeirah property, but lack of pool. It find the Jumeirah Beach hotel offer the best pool facilities.

The other added value as a guest at Burj Al Arab is a free entrance to Wild Wadi Water Park which is fun to visit when you are ""a water lover"" (trust me, there are more adult than children in this Water Park).

The restaurant venue in Burj Al Arab is wonderful. We wanted to try Al Mahara (which is their signature underwater restaurant) but the restaurant required formal dress (Jacket and no Jeans!). Unfortunately we did not bring any Jacket with us, therefore we went to other Jumeirah property's restaurant near by as an option. One of my favorite one is ""PaiThai"" at Al Qasr, Madinat Jumeirah. The food was authentic. The setting was nice, especially getting there with water taxi... made the experience unique.

We had two nights stay and my Overall Rating:
- Guest Service: Good, but not WOW ! 
- Hotel Facilities: The suite are large, but it is not my style. Too traditional !!
- Restaurant : Good but not extraordinary (for Breakfast and Lunch!)
- Hotel View : The best in town !!!

Dubai is rating as one of the most growing cities for tourism, and yet it has very large variety offered for accommodation. It is definetly worth for the money that you spent. My best memory of this property is The VIEW... and the Quiet and exclusiveness.. which is really worth it if you looking for some privacy !!

On the other hand it is nice to have the experience, but this property do not have the WOW aspect that will make me want to comeback and stay there again. As people said.. been there.. done that.. !! That is how i describe this property..
Once is enough.!!

If I am back to dubai.. certainly will consider other property such as One & Only Royal Mirage or..Armani Hotel , which is schedule to open in 2008.

Tip:  If you are AMEX Platinum / Centurion members, book it with AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts Rate for an extra perks.

"Fun to Experience","We stayed in a panoramic suite while on our way to the Maldives. I am glad we stopped because it was a memorable experience and broke up our long trip.  Dubai is a  unique place and there are a lot of fun things to do and see while there. I wasn't too impressed with the shopping, it's just like any other large city, same stores, same prices. I actually prefer NYC, London or Paris because you get to walk around outside and see sights, in Dubai everything is inside and I find that less enjoyable. We visited one mall when we spent a few hours snow skiing indoors. For some reason I wasn't expecting it to be that cold, but it was. I was just wearing a long cotton dress (I do advise women to cover up out of respect, although there are those who do not) and I got very cold (but I do get cold easily, like most women do). It was a fun few hours. More exciting was the dune buggy ride in the desert. It is soooo fun and a crazy adventure. A tad scary because you are just strapped into this little buggy which goes pretty fast and you whip around the dunes in a caravan. Of course I got stuck a few times and had to be pulled out, but they were nice about it. I highly recommend going on the buggies, but keep in mind that if you are (or are with) a prissy girl, you get really dirty (sand gets EVERYWHERE!) and it is a little scary. We stayed for the BBQ dinner and belly dancing, which was fun, but I would have preferred going back earlier (it takes about an hour to get out there) and having a nice dinner somewhere (but not at the Al Mahara). The Gold Souk was fun to walk around in for a while, but everything felt cheap to me, so we didn't purchase anything.

The Burj is fun. It's exactly like the pictures, very opulent. Our room was huge, and of course the mirror is a fun surprise (even when you know about it). They are obviously very attentive to your needs. Our room service breakfast was delicious, and they had lots of fresh fruit and little treats as well. Oh, and the Hermes toiletries. All wonderful. I guess my only complaint was our experience at the Al Mahara. We enjoy indulging every once in a while, but chose not to go crazy here because the wine prices were just ridiculous. They are absurd even for a 5 star hotel. The food was terrible overall. And they served shark fin soup in a restaurant centered around an absolutely stunning aquarium with sharks swimming around. Seemed kind of backwards to me. Anyways, the bread and desserts were good, but the everything else was not. They are trying to be sophisticated and modern and it's just not happening, furthermore the ingredients did not seem of the finest quality. And the simulated submarine voyage is kind of cheesy, like a ride at Disney. We still had a memorable time regardless.

So, it's fun, a unique experience to tell your friends about and show off some pictures. I doubt we will go back to Dubai again, unless it's a stopover, but it we had a fabulous time and I think if you can, spend a little money for the experience.

"fantantastic","I new It would be a lovely hotel as friends had told me, but we were overwhelmed by it all. The staff are just so friendly, without being intrusive, we were totally spoilt from our rolls royce pickup at the airport, to our butler filling the jacuzzi on our arrival. It was our wedding anniversary and they made it so special, They think of everything to make your holiday perfect. If you are wondering if this hotel is worth the money, then yes it is. It is pure luxury, and if you are celebrating a special occasion, I can assure you, you will not forget it. Can't wait to go back!!!!

"Great Service","What a wonderful hotel with such a warm and friendly staff.  On the day we arrived they upgraded us to a Panoramic Suite, gave us early check in, and our butler gave us a tour of one of the two bedroom premier suites.  The manager even invited us for cocktails and granted us 6PM checkout.  I never thought that it could exceed our high expectations, but it did.  It is a once in a lifetime kind of place.

"Only people who'd rate this 7* are themselves, which is the case!","If you like 'C' list celebs, and other people with more money than sense (or taste), then go join them at this self-certified farce.

As a money making enterprise it's without equal, as a hotel you'd be better severed in a TravelLodge. The only thing the management care about here is getting as much of your wealth as possible.

Some examples: book dinner and get told what you must eat (main course 'compulsory'), when you must arrive (within 15 minutes of your booking), what you can and can not do, and a long description on what constitutes 'smart casual'. Given some of your fellow dinners can barely use cutlery it's to be expected! Food is average (quality, not price) too.

If you want a proper hotel, rated by people who know hotels, and run by hoteliers, not accountants then go to the Ritz (far better).

"one and only 7star hotel","its a amazing hotel. which has fantastic staff and management.

"Amazing place","I was lucky enough to stay here for my 30th Birthday and what an experience it was....This hotel is truly one of the best hotels in the world, the service, the staff, the att. to detail is incredible.

I travelled with my 3 yr old daughter and i cannot tell you how amazed i was at how friendly and inviting the staff were towards her.   

The hotel itself is stunning and the rooms are exactly like they are shown in the photos. The Butler was so welcoming and nothing was ever
too much trouble.  

I never had to lift a finger, everytime i stepped out of the lift and
on to the floor, the staff would open my room door and make sure that
everything was ok.

The beach is lovely and so is the pool area. You will find yourself snapping away every chance you get. What i did find though was that there are millions of tourists in the lobby area and it was quite annoying at times. They were all snapping away and sitting in front of the fountains and blocking the view so much so that we couldn't even take a picture without them in the background...we finally gave up!

All the facilities in the room and the little touches really make your stay enjoyable and special. This hotel is worth writing about and definatley worth a visit.

Breakfast was lovely with cakes, pastries, hot and cold buffets and fresh juices and we never found ourselves waiting around. All the staff in the hotel will know you by name and if they dont they will find out!

We also stayed at the Al Qasr which is also stunning and definatley worth a visit however you do notice a considerable drop in the quality of service which is to be expected. I cannot fault either of these hotels...if you get the chance to go then don't even think about it..just go!

An experience of a lifetime....","5","2007-03"
"True wow factor!","We have just returned from our first visit to Dubai.  We spent 2 nights at the Burj before moving to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel for a further 8 nights.  In retrospect we should have arranged it the other way around because we are forever spoilt by the Burj!

From the moment of arrival at the airport until check out we could not have been treated any better.  We have a toddler and a baby so were a little worried about how we would be received, but I cannot stress how entirely welcoming and friendly they were towards us and our children.  Our daughter went on to suffer with Chicken Pox at the Jumeirah and, although we were treated well there, I could not help thinking about how much fun it would have been to be quarantined at the Burj!

We had a two bedroom suite as we were unable to book a one bedroom one, but would imagine that it would have been equally impressive.  The space was amazing and I have just unpacked the Hermes toileteries they gave us and can't find our bed underneath them all - should keep us going for a while!  The fact that they bring little treats all the time just adds to the magical experience - it really is like being a child all over again!

We didn't have much chance to try the restaurants.  We  ate at the pool side restaurant for breakfast, which was lovely - they overheard our (2 year old) daughter say she would like some peas so they cooked some for her!  I would recommend reserving the reasaturants for the evenings as we were unable to get into the restaurants on the first night so booked into the buffet on the second and had a nice meal (buffets are always a good option for us as my husbanc is veggie).  I would, however, say that the buffet at Latitude in the Jumeirah Beach Hotel is by far the best we have ever had.

The decor is opulent and not what I would choose in my own home - but it is breath-taking and adds to the overall experience.

We are seasoned travellers and have stayed in some of the best hotels around the world  ( I know everyone says this, but it's true - since selling my husband's company five years ago our feet have barely touched the ground!) and I can honestly say that this is the best by far.  I can't remember the last time I walked into a room and felt that total and immediate 'wow'.  Reading  some of the less than enthusiastic reviews of other travellers has puzzled us, but I guess everyone has different tastes.  The only disappointing thing about it is that we may never be this impressed by a hotel again!
","5",
"Burj - absolutely fantastic hotel.","We had been warned to expect absolute luxury, but nothing prepared us for our visit to the Burj! From the Butler service to the friendliness of the staff to the opulent surroundings - nothing was left to chance. If there are any hotels better than this in the world, i would like to visit, because I cannot imagine being made more welcome. We stayed at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi, but it was nothing compared to the Burj. We are definitely going back to the Burj when I save up, but the visit to Emirates Palace was a one off for the experience. All in all, if you aren't satisfied with the Burj, there is something seriously wrong with you!!
","5","2006-09"
"Social Club for Employees","Ahh and so it begins... A stay at the infamous ""7-Star"" Burj Al Arab situated on its own man made island in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  Burj in Arabic means ""tower"" so in translation it is the ""Arabian Tower"".  I hail from Long Island, New York and am quite accustomed to good service having travled the world numerous times while staying with the best of 'em.  The Grandeur of the approach to the Burj will place you in an ""awe-like"" state while you try to take in as much as possible.  The security is not a laughing matter unlike the the crew of Heathrow's airport, but that is another review entirely.  As you cross the bridge onto the man made island that supports this great Structure which is the tallest hotel in the world you can not help but just sit back and smile.  Your expectation of the service you are about to experience runs wild with anticipation growing rampantly.  Walking in into the Burj is a lovely experience that is hard to describe so I can only suggest that you might one day take on this wonderful journey to the Burj.  Of course there is no reception desk one can only imagine standing in line to check into a ""7-star"" hotel.  With your entry into the Burj, you will be greeted many times very politely and seated while served a refreshing cold towel to help rejuvenate you from the HOT Arabian sun.  Any refreshments will immediatly be offered to you while delicious dates are place in front of you just as Adam and Eve were tempted with that damn apple that has landed all of us here (outside the garden).  Enjoy! your on vacation but beware that two dates contain the sugar content for one entire day of a normal 2,000 calorie intake diet.  Of course now you ask are you reading the review of the Burj or some guys rant on sugar intake?  One of the staff members will escort you up to your suite.  You should know that the Burj does not have any ""rooms"" only 202 two level suites.  On your way up the escalators please notice the two giant aquarium fish tanks situated to the left and the right because these are the first tanks any new fish brought to the Burj will enter.  You might not have time to look left and right on account of the wonderful water design in between the escalators.  As I am told the designers of the Bellagio's water show have traveled accross the world to design the water attractions at the Burj.  As you arrive ontop the escalator and step onto what is known as the upper lobby you will look up and realize that you are not in any high class hotel but in the Burj Al Arab.  What I can tell you from viewing pictures and watching the documentary on the discovery channel before embarking on my journey is that the dynamic human eye is the best way to not only view but enjoy this experience.  While you are on your way through the lobby the escort is explaining the architecture of the Burj along with all the ammenities such as dinning, shopping and of course the facilities such as their own water park called Wild Wadi(which is complementary to guest of the Burj).  One feature of the elevators which I found exetremly nice is one you have pressed the button whether up or down, one of the elevators will light up once not because it has arrived but to show you which one will be arriving.  This is a small but nice feature that takes the guess work out of which of the six elevators to stand in front of, while most hotels' elevators ensure the guest situated themselves in the middle and feel like a soccer goalie during a shootout.  Upon arrival on your floor you will see the floor conceirge greet you while a smile that is from ear to ear.  Entry to your suite is another feeling all together, it is a mix of euphoria and that feeling you had in high school when she said ""yes"".  Your butler explains how to opperate your interactive suite.  You door itself is equiped with an intercom and video camer which you can interact with from any of the 14 phones in your suite.  Do not even think that for a moment that you will have to answer the door yourself, a button situated on the telephone and the TV remote controls will open the door for you, of course after viewing who reall is at the door.  Is it the butler or some drunk ""New Russian"" who does not know what to do with his money, and please do not try to confront any of the sort because they will just try to ""buy"" you.  My slight suggestion to them is use the money for a couple etiquette lessons.  Anyway back to the review, I apologize for that tangent.  The bottom floor has a living room, dinning area, two bars, full office area with laptop and mulitfunction fax/copier/printer available for you.  The plasma Tv situated behind a gold plated frame fully internet ready with a wireless keyboard ready for your disposal.  If you would like to take a gander at your view just pick up your remote control and press the button accordingly.  I do suggest not opening the curtains until the butler departs from your suite on the fact that you will be so distracted by the view that anything the butler says will not go in one ear and out the other but might not even find its way into your ear canal!  The bell boys will ask to confirm their placement of your luggage which of course is always welcomed.  The check in process is now completed by your conceirge in your room.  You can enjoy the lovely arrangement of fruits or dates or even cookies while completing this process.  The staircase leading up to your bedroom is all gold plated and walking up and down these stairs certainly makes you feel like royalty (at least like Sir Elton John).  After settling in for a bit I quickly put on my bathing suite and adorned myself with the robe and slippers provided for me and took off for the pool.  The pool over looks the Arabian gulf and in the distance you can see the infamous Palm and World Projects.  While relaxing by the pool a wide variety of refreshments are offered to you as well as a complementary berry smoothie shot.

"Go Go Go, absoutely fantastic.","We stayed here over xmas including xmas day for three nights.

On arrival at airport i had arrange for a car to collect us, we were fast tracked through the airport and were then met with the Rolls Royce and a lovely rose bouquet for myself. On arrival at the hotel we were wisked straight to our room and shown the numerous gadgets etc. The room is fantastic its on two levels with amazing space and is so opulent, the bathroom had the biggest spa bath i have ever seen, would fit two adults in easily. bathroom products were fab, Hermes and loads of. We were invitied  to go to managers cocktail party, which was really nice, carol singers, snow, champange , canapes etc. We had a standard suite, and i will now be saving very hard to go again. Service was excellent.

You must stay once in your life. It was the best experience of my life.","5","2006-12"
"Lovely hotel","This hotel is one of the hotels we would return to when we're in Dubai. We stayed at the Burj for the second time. The service has been great, although when we arrived with our rental car, they were too busy to cater to us right away. We had to wait 90 seconds before someone attended to us. I don't know if it was because of my complaint or because we're return customers, the manager invited us to a Christmas party held in their ballroom that night. This was a great party. We canceled our booking at a restaurant that night because we were full after eating the hors doeuvres at their cocktail reception!

We stayed at the Kempinski Emirate Palace and Mall of the Emirates at this trip as well and although these are nice hotels, I still prefer the Burj. 

The Hermes toiletries from the ensuite bathroom at the Burj is worth almost half the room cost! The room is so spacious that this stay is a very good value for the money.

"One of the most Memorable Weeks of our Lives","My wife and I stayed here in November for the 3rd time, on this occasion for 8 nights to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary and my birthday.
I find it really hard to put into words our experience  at this wonderful and awesome place. My wife has mobility difficulties and on our last visit (4 years ago) we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom Disabled suite on the 20th floor.I contacted the General Manager, Mr Luc Delafosse, about our planned visit and asked if it would be possible to have use of this suite again. Unfortunately it was  booked for our entire stay but he most generously and thoughtfully upgraded us to a 3 bedroom 3 bathroom suite which had a ""ground"" floor bedroom, on the 21st floor. It was a magnificent panoramic suite about 7 times larger than our home!! and furnished and acquitted with  the true Burj style and glamour.
From the welcome at Dubai airport to our final farewells we  experienced a standard of service from every member of the hotels staff, some of whom remembered us from out last visit 4 years ago, that will live in our memories for a very long time. Wonderful meals in all of the restaurants including a dining extravaganza at the seafood restaurant with a complimentary bottle of chamagne to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary. Chocolate cakes and a trio, with guitarist! to sing on my birthday, every day there was something new and yet done just for us.
The General Manager asked if he could come to see us in our suite and he came with a lovely gift for my wife and all the charm and courtesy you would expect from such a representative of this iconic hotel. A true gentleman and it was our privalege to meet him. We are not royalty, celebrities, or professional footballers (only in my dreams!), but we could not have been looked after any better if we were, I really cannot wait to return ( God, my bank manager and my wifes health permitting)
Just a thought but all those reviews from other, I agree stunning, hotels telling us to go there and forget the Burj... a goodly proportion of them feaure more photographs of the Burj, inside and outside, than the hotels they are staying at !! Hmmmmm
I write this review as testimony to and with my thanks to all who made our week one to remember and that includes the friendly guys who cleaned our suite right up to  Mr Delafosse and all in between.
It really cannot get any better.. thanks to all

"You Must Stay Here Once Before You Die","Stayed for 2 nights as part of a package organised by Emirates World Travel Cologne (EWTC) **.  Everything you may have seen about this hotel is true - but you really do have to see it to believe it. 

Highlights: Eating on the beach at the restaurant Majlis Al Bahar (just about as romantic as you can get); Being taken by white limo to a restaurant in nearby Madinat Jumeirah; Swimming in the indoor swimming pool 18 floors up looking over Dubai at night; Cocktail reception with the General Manager. 

** Recomend this agency if you are based in Germany and want a package in UAE.

"Fantastic. Excellent. And probably a once in a lifetime stay","I could run out of superlatives to describe our stay at the Burj. True, we were special guests, but under normal circumstances this would be a very expensive hotel. It's decor is completely over the top as is the service, but it would be worth every penny!
","5","2006-10"
"We wil return!!!","Absolutely fabulous! We have no complaints  whatsoever!

Experience of a lifetime.The staff are outstanding! Without any information from ourselves, they  arrived at the suite on my partners birthday with a beautiful cake, flowers and a card from the management! 

Accomodation wonderful, views outstanding, food as you would expect !  We can't wait to return!

"BEAUTIFUL, LUXURIOUS, AMAZING ARCHITECTURE WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED","This hotel was amazing and so beautiful, it was def worth a 7 star and anyone who said it was less than excellent obviously are used to the 5 star luxury and do not know when they are seeing a good thing!!! Fussing over the butlers not knowing where to put your stuff is a bit silly. Everything was lovely and the architecture was amazing inside and out. 
Def once in a lifetime opportunity if you can afford it!!

"Super the luxe","Voorburg, The Netherlands: We stayed for the second time at the Burj Al Arab, this time in a double bedroom suite. Last time we had a panoramic suite which we really liked for the two of us but as we took our son (one year) with us we decided to take the double bedroom suite. And this is a really big suite, over 480 square meters. If you are going to stay there just with two persons it´s just to big. 

A tip we can give you is to bring your squash shoes, the Burj Al Arab has an excellent squash court and they can provide you with raquets.

With our son we had dinner in the room twice, and if you stay here you should do the same, we didn´t really like the resaurants that much and dinner in the room is excellent also beacause it´s equipt with a full size dining room.

If you go you should visit the Wadi park, great fun for an hour or two, if you go from 10 to 11 the park is just for hotel guests and you don´t have to wait anywhere.

The Burj Al Arab had build a new swimmingpool at the beach which is really nice and large. We preferred that above the pool at the back of the hotel.

Next year we´ll go again but a few days is all we need.

"Out of this world","My wife and I have travelled all over the place, but this hotel has to have been the best we have ever been to.  You get picked up at the airport before even going through customs, and are then taken by Rolls Royce to the hotel.

The sky bar is out of this world, and has the best range of malts, brandys I have even seen.

I won't say anymore, but do this spend the money on the expericen of a life time, you only live once.

PS were we booked in for 3 days and stayed 7!!!!
","5","2006-02"
"Amazing......","My wife and i stayed here for 1 night after a 4 night stay in the one and only royal mirage (arabian court) as part of our honeymoon before we flew onto the maldives.  As you pull up to the hotel it stikes you just how big this hotel is, but at 321 metres it is the highest in the world!.  As you get out of your car (doorstaff open the door), you are greeted into the reception where you are seated and wait for your floor manager to greet you.  Our floor manager took us up to our suite and as they knew we where a honeymoon couple they had upgraded our suite from a panaromic to a club suite - WOW, WOW & WOW!, the suite was on the 19th floor and had amazing views of the world being built on one side and to the front the beachfront of dubai (wadi, wadi, mall of the emirates etc...). We also had a chocolate cake, champagne, flowers as well as the usual snacks and hermes products.  Our floor manager then showed us round the suite, the suite had(ground floor), a formal lounge with cocktail bar, another informal lounge with large plasma tv, dinning room, snooker room with full size snooker table, kitchen (why i dont know?), cloakroom, storage room for luggage, upstairs there was another lounge overlooking downstairs, a desk area with free laptop and internet use area, large bedroom, dressing room and a huge bathroom.  Yes the hotel is expensive and OTT, but then if you are not after being treated to all of this then stay somewhere cheaper, this is an experience, we stayed in our suite the whole time we where there (its better value to get your butler bring dinner to you).  Overall though its the service that you reciev which makes this hotel stand out, go with an open mind and you will be blown away, go with an attitude of everyone should do everything for you and well, you will probably rub people up the wrong way.","5","2006-09"
"a bit overrated","spent two nights at this hotel from 15th-17th sep. On arrival at this hotel we were told that our room was not ready even though we had checked beforehand that it would be okay to check in at 1pm instead of the usual 2pm, the staff then ushered us to the lounge for a complimentary tea or coffee while we waited. After a short wait we were then shown to our suite on the 13th floor and can honestly say that it was worth the wait! I dont have to go into how luxurious the suites are as i am sure you have all seen the pictures but can honestly say that they were gorgeous but not entirely sure if the suites are worth the seven star rating. After being shown by our butler how to work the remote control for the curtains, door, etc, we thought we would be asked if we would like our cases unpacked but ended up doing it ourselves. The utler then returned to the door a total of seven times to ask us trivial questions that he could have asked on the telephone and asked four times if we wanted him to make a reservation for dinner even though we had told him that we had already booked. Are these guys on commission? A nice touch and I suppose these are what makes this hotel special was that the butler returned to the door again but this time mentioned that he had noticed from my husbands passport when we checked in that it was his birthday and produced a birthday cake and a bouquet of red roses. We had friends join us for drinks in the skybar and for  four beers and three spirits with one bottle of mixer it cost us £60. I knew that the bar was going to be expensive but still thought this a little excessive. Good tip is to go on the golf buggy outside to the madinat and go to the boardwalk pubs, trader vics, left bank etc where the food is half the price as is the alchol and you get a much better relaxed atmosphere. The buffet breakfast at the poolside is excellent and even included fillet steak! The pools themselves let this hotel down as i would have expected something fabulous for the seven star rating, can honestly say the pools at caesars palace las vegas are far superior for a quarter of the price. The freebies in the room are wonderful, including fruit platter every day, welcome bottle of wine, canapes and savoury snacks but best of all are the full size hermes products in the bathroom, which are very luxurious but lets remember how much you are paying to stay here so you would expect nothing less. Overall we had a wondeful stay at this hotel, i think it would be a one off visit for most people. The staff here are friendly, polite and helpful although at times we had to put do not disturb on the door to get some peace. I would reccomend that everyone should try this place just to experience it but im not sure its worth the price tag as its a bit over the top and didnt realise that if you are staying at any of the other jumeria hotels that you can get access to this place after a certain time so felt a bit over run with people just wanting a look at times.

"Amazing","I stayed @ the Burj for 1 night with partner and all i can say about the hotel is WOW.
 The best part for me was the beach as it was always quiet and total luxury, what with the complimentry water and face sprays you get amongst other things.
 Also whilst we were sunbathing we noticed that Wayne Rooney and Coleen were sitting by us.
 Overall the Burj deserves its 7* rating, although i do agree with the previous comment about the swimming pool being to small.
 Worth every penny spent to stay there.
","5","2006-08"
"Decadent but styleless","We stayed for 2 nights at the Burj prior to our 8 night stay at the Jumeriah Beach Hotel (second year at the JBH).  We had admired the Burj from the JBH last year and just had to have a stay and see inside.  The candid photos on this site really show it as it is.  What they don't prepare you for is the size of the hotel and in particular the suites.  We were staying in a one bed suite and as another reviewer said they really are bigger than most people's houses!  The service was excellent and the private check-in is a breath of fresh air - everything about the Burj is personal and calm.  You could not get stressed out here.  

As we had our 9 yr old daughter with us, we chose to go to the private beach club (the Executive Pool of the JBH), as she wanted to go into the kid's club.  The beach club is lovely, having only been built in the last 8 months).  The pool at the Burj is small, and while you do get spoilt with the Evian sprays, cold face towels etc - it just wasn't for us.  That's the only down side about the Burj - their pool area!  I would have thought they would have really done something special - you can go a long way with an infinity pool but hey ho!

The burj is a place that you should go and stay in just for one night to spoil yourself and say youve been there and then take home all the Hermes goodies!

"Its not a 'hotel stay', it's an 'experience'...","I am reading and reading the reviews of some travellers on this website and I am more than amazed to see reviews with less than 5 stars. This amazing hotel is ranked 19th in Dubai, with its far less superior sister-hotel - Jumeirah Beach Hotel ranked 2nd!!!
Out of curiousity, I read some of the reviews of JBH just to see what JBH offers that BAA doesnt, and funnily the guests of JBH were praising the fact that they had a ""great view of the Burj"" and they had a great dinner at the Burj, in comparison to the Burj guests who seem to be looking for teeny tiny faults just so that they can say they didnt like something in the Burj. How ironic!!!
Anyhow, here is what I saw:

1. Decor - The decor of the hotel is purely amazing! Its where 1001 Arabian nights mix of Gold, Color and Oriental mystery meet the 21st Century . 
This does not go to say that I will ever decorate my house in the same style, but in the context of the Arabic culture, the hotel interior is flabbergastingly tasteful and rich. If  one is to label this as ""gaudy"" and ""stupid opulence"" , then one is clearly narrow-minded and capable of evaluating beauty only through the prism of one's narrow views.
Some traveler complained he did not see any real gold... and where exactly did in room amenities real gold was promised by management???!!!

2. Flowers - Superb red and orange roses were present everywhere. Our apartment had beautiful arrangements of red mini-callas, red roses and green cymbid orchids.

3. Restaurants - Visited the Acquarium restaurant, it costed between 500AED (appx 136$) and 700AED (appx 200$) pp for a 3 or 5 course menu excluding the alcohol. We did not have dinner there as we liked but not loved the interior and we did not determine the prices to offer a good value. 
We did try the dinner buffet at Al Iwan (2nd floor restaurant) - 350 AED pp and I must say despite my dislike of buffets and the fact that this is the most expensive buffet we ever ate at, the food was very very good and there were at least 150 dishes to choose from including fillet mignon, rack of lamb, sushi, iranian grill, balinese food, etc. 
Room service is expensive too - upward of 250AED for a main course. Beer ranges between 50 - 80 AED. Water is 24AED, however you are provided with bottled Evian morning and evening complimentary. 

4. Service - 
a) We were met by Jumeirah representative before passport control and we did not wait on line because of that.
b) A Chauffer driven 7 series white BMW was waiting for us out side the terminal - I was given red roses by the chauffer, then we were offerred cold towels to refresh, cold water and a menu of music for the ride to the hotel
c) Upon entering the hotel, we were ""ganged"" by several staff members, one offered us cold towels, the other offered us dried dates (very yummy) and a third one offered us coffee. I am not counting the many that held doors for us or carried luggage for us. 
d) We were checked in en-suite without having to stand in line anywhere
e) A bottle of wine, and three special ""burj-al arab"" boxes of dates, mini-pastries and crackers awaited us in the suite. The table was set with a huge bowl of fruit (apples, bananas, oranges, passion fruit, kiwi, green grapes, black grapes, pears, pineapple, etc) and fruit was replenished daily. 
f) a selection of over 100 newspapers was offered free of charge
g) a selection of 26 pillows was offered free of charge
h) the butler offerred to set our bath (but not to unpack, which we woulnt have taken advantage of anyways)
i) everyone, and i really mean EVERYONE was extremely polite regardless of whether we tipped them or not. We tried to tip as many people there work mainly on gratuities
j) One hour after we mentioned we were on a honeymoon, the butler arrived with an AMAZING cake, a card from management and a huge bouquette of fresh roses (with water drops - so beautiful)
k) Afternoon snack of the most delicious deserts were offerred daily by our butler
l) upon arrival, our suite had two flutes full of fresh orange juice which were served by our butler
m) there were 2 100ml eau de toilette bottles - for ladies, 1 - for men, 1 deodorant - for men, 1 - 75ml perfume - for ladies, 1 - 100ml - aftershave - for men, 1 - full size - body wash - unisex, 1 full size shampoo + conditioner - for ladies, 1 shampoo & bodywash - for men, 2 large soap bars - for men, 2 smaller soap bars - for women, 1 set of bath salts - unisex, I might have missed something - but all of the above is from Hermes. Additionally, there are tooth brushes (normal full size colgate, i think) + toothpaste, shaving kit (real 3 blade Gilette with 2 extra ""heads""), sewing kit + bath salts for the Jacuzzi. 
n) the day before we departed, the butler came in with a rose in his hand and a survey, he asked us for feedback.
o) the night before we departed, we came back to see another set of 5 mini-perfumes (one for me and one for my husband) placed on our bed. The brand was Amouage, I have not heard of it, but it turns out one of these perfumes goes for 110 Euro per 75ml.
p) To sum up - every time we needed something, it was delivered within 5 minutes and service was IMPECCABLE!!!

5. Amenities:
a) 1 42 inch plasma tv & 1 32 inch plasma tv
b) A selection of about 200 on-demand movies free of charge
c) Additional selection of DVDs available upon request
d) The suite has a bell and every time someone rings on the door, the TV starts and camera shows who is ringing. Additionally all phones in the suite start rining as well. If privacy is sought, Do not disturb button solves this problem, and noone, not even staff can enter or ring on your door.
e) Furniture is extremely comfortable - too bad I didnt have time to sleep on every couch
f) the business section of the suite, has own laptop, a fax machine (with own fax number!!!) and free internet. If you bring your own laptop, a local IT staff can set it up so that it works wireless.
 
I also forgot to mention the fact that you get free entrance + towel to the nearby Wild Wadi water park, where you are taken by a hotel buggy (bigger golf cart). You never have to wait for the buggy, always one available, you can also enter 1 hour ahead of the general public (1 hour before the park oficially opens) so that you can ride without waiting on lines. I forgot to mention the pool area, behind the beach that is very nice, we did not use as we did not have time. The spa pool and jacuzzi are amazing too. 

I tried to give everything that the Burj offers and I am not sure I am even half the list. I challenge here anyone who knows another 5 star hotel giving such large suites for less than 1,000 a night and the above list of ""bells and whistles"". Go experience the Burj - leave worries that you ""won't belong"" and have an open mind about the culture that you will see and you will have memories for a lifetime.

"Yo Yo Yo it ain't worth it!","My friends and I bought into the hype and stayed there.  How could you not when a hotel promises so much.  I was quite disappointed with my stay.

1) The Burj definition of service is having a gigantic number of questionably qualified staff on site at all times.  The 'butlers' do a good job of showing you the room and its features, but if you need them to do something for you it's a hassle.  They asked us if we wanted them to unpack our bags - we said yes, and they did it reluctantly.  We also had to micro-manage the whole process (they asked us where everything was supposed to go).  
When you call the front desk to ask a simple question it is not unusual to get bounced around to two or three different people until you get an answer.  And when you need something brought to your room it takes forever.

We asked for information on a riverboat dinner - they told us they had a brochure.  After thirtly minutes, and a follow-up phone call to remind them we needed the brochure, a delivery boy brought up the same list of the Jumeirah resort restaurants that we already had in the room.

Each floor has a private reception desk - if you need something from them they usually tell you to go downstairs to main reception.  I'm not sure why they are even there or what purpose they serve.

2) The hotel is technologically advanced circa 1998.  There is a master remote control that controls the TV, music, drapes, etc.  The screen was broken and it was hard to use.  Everything is showing its age.

3) Did not eat at any of the restaurants in the Burj but I'm sure they are not worth it.  They wanted appx. $30 for a personal pizza at the beachfront restaurant.    The same food was half price at the Al Qasr or the Beach Club.  The Jumeirah restaurants we ate at outside of the Burj were all pretty good, however.

4) The room was huge.  We stayed in a standard room and it was a two-story duplex.  It was well appointed and comfortable but the furniture and color selection were gaudy and cheesy.  Stupid ""Trump"" style opulence.  I've heard rumors in the past that there is ""solid gold this-and-that"" and ""the hotel will never make money because it cost so much to build"" etc.  I didn't see any non market standard finishes at the property.  And the gold columns and pillars were hollow and appeared to be made out of plastic.  The hotel looked really good, though.

5) Each day the butlers will bring an afternoon snack to your room.  The first day they brought us a huge plate of AWESOME chocolates.  The second day they brought us tea sandwiches.  Also, there is a free bottle of wine in the room (it was OK), as well as crackers and dates.  Very nice touches.

6) The fitness center is great.  The equipment is top-of-the-line and the staff is very friendly.  Also, the spa is really nice, and the pool and Jacuzzi rooms are quite stunning and offer an excellent view of Dubai.

7) Passes to Wild Wadi are free, which is great because there's not alot to do in Dubai.  We had a good time there.  Other nice touches include free valet parking (you never have to wait very long) and free internet (in today's world of constant up-charging).

I agree with others who have posted - it is impossible for the Burj to live up to what it promises.  All-in-all the service is quite good and the rooms are comfortable, but not worth the money.  If your company is paying stay there in a heartbeat but if you are paying yourself stay at the Al Qasr if you want to stay at a resort, or stay at the Emirates towers if you are looking for more of a business hotel.

"blown away at the burj","we have just come home from a 6 night stay at jumeirah beach hotel and 1 night in the burj which was for my husbands 50th birthday  and i must say  that this hotel is fantastic.  We had done our homework and looked on the net etc and all the rooms but nothing could prepare us for the feeling we got when they opened the door to our room we were totally ""blown away"" we were so overwhelmed that  i couldnt speak for a few mins as i would have cried and it wasnt even my birthday!. this hotel is the best in the world, the treatment that we had was fantastic as it is in the jumeirah beach hotel, but we were a little concerned with the negative reviews  on this site , i can only think that the people that were treated badly were very unlucky and the  people who thought that the burj was over the top and tacky  should have realised that this is an overthe top hotel and should have stayed in another, this is what you stay here for and we enjoyed every moment of the over the top and being treated like a celeb, we couldnt praise this hotel enough and we have no negatives at all.
I wont go into all the little suprises in the hotel but you have probably read about them anyway, but i must say that we thought this would be a one of experience for a treat and we were so impressed that we are talking about staying here again, one night was just not enough 3-5 would have been great.  Every one was so polite and freindly and Newton our butler was fantastic, he showed us around the hotel and into other suites and nothing was to much trouble he was lovely and took pride in his work and loved his job, this is how we find every one in dubai they seem to love what they do and take pride in helping people and being polite and freindly.  We have stayed in Jumeirah beach hotel now 3 times and this is fantastic and each time we go to dubai our holidays have only go t better and this time we had the icing on the cake with the burj, it is a must do, i would rather open the door to our suite in the burj than have a prezzy and this felft like all your bithdays and christmas's at once.  We didnt eat in the burj only because we didnt see the point in spending out that kind of money on a meal when we could get the same service and qaulity in the Jumeirah beach or the mina salam for half the price, but we did have breakfast which was included and ate this by the pool outside in the warm breeze, every thing abouth this hotel was just perfect and we would advise everyone to to this at least one in their lifetime. We had been in the burj previous to our stay for a drink but there is nothing like actually staying in here because we were made to feel that we actually belonged here and were not just visiting. the best holiday ever thanks to the burj, start saving now!

"Must do experience!","Beeing may times in Dubai I always wanted to stay at the Burj Al Arab for a night. I was there with my gf a couple of times for a dinner (great way to gain full entry to the hotel) and we finally realised our wish and stayed there for a night.

In our case it was fair best option to book the hotel directly over Internet and the hotel web site since we got it for half price (cca. 600$).

Everything was quite exceptionel and not beeing used to be serviced by a private buttler quite strange at first hehe :)

Well it really pays of to stay at the hotel for one night since you get free entry to Wild Wadi, free bottle of Wine, sweets...And on tops of that you get full size perfumes, soaps....of Hermes Paris. Trust me that will make your wife/gf very happy! Not to mention the lovely Burj Al Arab shopping bag! So at the end when you draw the line your night will maybe only cost you some 200$-300$ everything else you'll get back by freebies.

Staying there for more than one night though would be quite expensive and well you don't stay in room on your vacation right
","5","2005-08"
"It is amazing!","My wife and I enjoyed 3 nights at the Burj to celebrate a birthday mid June 2006.  

From arriving at the gates, to be told, 'welcome home' to entering the lobby to be ushered to our suite, you really experience the wow factor.  This hotel really is a sight and although we had read a few articles, we really didn't know what to expect and simply went with  the flow.

Our suite was located on the 11th floor (really the 22nd as each suite has 2 floors) and were immediately greated by the floor reception and butler.  We were shown to our suite and then listened to our butler explain the gadgets and the facilities.  We were told that everything from slippers, beach shoes, bags, toileteries were ours to take home.  Which we did!  We had a basic suite - believe me, these are bigger than many houses!

A snack of fizzy grape juice and cakes were brought into our room with the hotels' compliments.  Different snacks were offered daily.  This is in addition to the large fruit bowl and bottle of wine already in the suite.  You register at your desk in your suite next to your complimentary laptop with wireless broadband.

The butler handled the unpacking and packing.  After enjoying the view both internal and external, we arranged some dinner reservations (rather our butler did) and then decided to explore and visit the under water fish restaurant.  When we went downstairs to the fish restaurant (we didnt eat there as I didn't bring a jacket and tie - although the restaurant would have supplied one) the receptionist woudn't allow us admission as viewings had closed as they prepared for dinner.  Our butler was furious and immediately phoned the general manager.  Two minutes letter we received a verbal apology from the red faced receptionist and were shown downstairs (which is amazing by the way).

When we got back to our room, we were informed that the head of catering wanted to see us to personally apologise for the earlier issues (it really wasnt an issue).  This we clearly accepted and the following day a huge flower arrangement was delivered to our room.  That first night we ate at their Lebonese restaurant which was great although expensive (c£80 a head).  That followed a champagne cocktail party we were invited to earlier by the general manager.

Forget a small chocolate on your pillow here (also don't forget to choose from the menu of 26 pillows).  The bedside gfts are amazing!

The following day we sat by the pool (along with a handful of British Premiership footballers) and visited some local sites (there is a Souk next to the hotel with around 70 stores and dozens of restaurants) and there is free transportation to it by golf cart and boat).  At the pool, you choose your sun lounger.  The pool attendant puts down your towels, delivers water, cold flannels and evian sprays.

Breakfast buffets were amazing (although not sure about the camel milk on my corn flakes) and the lunches served at the pool side snack bar were equally as good.

Whilst at the Burj we visited their private beach along with Wild Wade the complimentary water slide park linked to the hotel.

After 3 days and having spent too much money in Dubai, it was time to take the hotel's Rolls Royce back the airport.  What a hard life!

We had an amazing time and desperately want to go back with our kids.  The problem is having stayed at the Burj, we really don't want to stay anywhere else in Dubai!
","5","2006-06"
"An Experience of a Lifetime - Well done to all at The Burj Al Arab!!","I always look on your site when booking a holiday, so when I returned from my trip to Dubai staying at the Burj al Arab I was intrigued to see what others thought of it.
I think we were staying at a different hotel to the two people who wrote comments before us - we were out there at the same time from the 3rd to 9th June and had an absolutely wonderful stay.

We couldn't fault a thing - we were greeted at the airport and fast tracked through immigration -  we were taken to a waiting white rolls-royce with chaufer in livery of the hotel who greeted us with cold flanels, water and a menu of music we would like to listen to on our journey.

At the hotel we were greeted by at least six members of staff who had been waiting outside for our arrival - the week just got better and better.

Our butlers were first class - then so were the service staff who serviced your room each time you left coming back to fresh bathrobes and towels. We never once felt we were not good enough to be there, we felt special and were treated like royalty.

I could write pages and pages about how fantastic this hotel was - we are well travelled and this is undoubtedly ""the best hotel in the world"" and deserves it's title.  We personally cannot wait to go back - Well done to all at the Burj Al Arab!!!
","5","2006-06"
"treated like dirt","I have stayed at the Burj al arab twice now on on both occassions found the service to be shocking. We ate in both the restruants and found them to be nothing special in fact we sent a meal back due to it being dry and over salted. We took friends to the underwater restruant and the service was at best three star with the waiters looking down their noses and demonstrating a distinct lack of table etiquette. Our baby was made to feel unwelcome and despite being advised that there was a no jeans policy several famous footballers turned up and were allowed in with jeans. Expect to pay around £1000 for lunch for 4 peole with charges of £75.00 for a child's portion of spag bog!
Have satyed in many hotels in Dubai and the best I still think is the Mina Salam or the Al Qsar and you'll pay half the price and they treat yopu like Royalty.
The Burj is an experience but don't  unless your a serious tipper expect to be treated with distain by waiters who earn less a year than it costs to stay in the hotel a night!
","1","2005-11"
"Fab.","Our second stay at the Burj - and it was just as fabulous as the last time we stayed a few years ago.  We especially liked getting tea/coffee whenever we liked from the butler (for free), the Hermes full-sized bottles in the bathrooms, the Evian sprays by the pool..etc
","5","2006-05"
"fantastic...but.....","we had 4 nights at the jumeirah beach hotel and 2 nights at the burj al arab.  this hotel is THE dubai landmark and if your staying in this area is ever present.  it's definitely a fitting entry in to the 100 things to do before you die list.  the hotel lives up to the opulent and outrageousness of the reviews here.  but...

our stay was not without incident.  we were given a transfer from the jumeirah beach in a posh car  
the car dropped us off at the burj
no one met us
no one ushered us into the hotel.

we walked through the door and to the desk and were invited to sit and wait...30 minutes lapsed before we were attended to.  the car had left with our luggage still in it and it took 3 1/2 hours to get it back (the jumeirah beach and the burj al arab are part of the same hotel chain the driver was a hotel group employee not a taxi driver i gave the model of car and the drivers name to at least 4 members of burj staff but it still took 3 1/2 hours and when the luggage did arrive they tried to blame the jumeirah beach hotel but it was entirely the fault of the burj staff)  that sort of knocked the edge off the 'wow' factor of the suite which was amazing.

however..again... the much anticipated 21st century electronics which work the curtains and tv and stuff crashed 3 times during our 2 day stay.  at checkout the butler was very keen to search the minibar to see what we had consumed before we left.  these small annoyances detracted from what is a truly breath taking hotel whose facilities are very 7 star.

staff were distinctly 4 star and they should be replaced with the staff from the lowly 5 star jumeirah beach hotel oppisite who are much friendlier and efficient.

"outstanding(the best hotel in the world)","What a fantastic hotel, stayed there for 2 nights in February with my girlfriend and my parents.. stayed in a 3 bedroom suite on the 21st floor, ""it was incredible!!""

Highly recommend the sky view restaraunt, ""Steak there was the best myself and girlfreind have ever had!!"" Also recommend a day out in the water park. You get free entry to the park and VIP treatment,  i am in a wheelchair and there was no bother for the lifeguards to lift me in and out the water so I go on the rides!! (the hotel is totally accessable)..

I can't believe some of the reports, i have read. ""Ok the place is expensive, but if your going to the best hotel in the world, you got to expect it!!!""

""The best hotel I've ever stayed in!!!"" Would definatley return...
","5","2006-02"
"Arab Perfection","Having used tripadvisor now for about a yr, it is my pleasure to write my first review.  We stayed at the Burj this past Feb & I must admit everything you've read is true!  The rooms are reminiscent of high-end Vegas suites (only these are the standard rooms).  You're butler will start you're jacuzzi while you're on your way back to the hotel & even let you in on the celebrities who happen to be staying in the hotel during your stay.

Having stayed at the Oriental Bangkok, the Peninsula in Hong Kong, The Fairmont in Whistler, The Dorchester in London, & the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, I must say this hotel takes the cake.  Every bit as good as advertised.

"Burj Al Arab Perfect Holiday","We stayed for four nights at the Burj Al Arab in October. The climate was perfect at this time of year. We arranged for the chauffeur driven Rolls to pick us up from our airport hotel. Its is handy booking an airport hotel for your first night as our flight did not get in to Dubai until midnight. The car picked us up at noon and the chaufffeur was very helpful pointing out sights etc on our journey. As you sweep up the private jetty to the Burj the sheer scale of this structure is overwhelming. The friendly staff greeted us with cool drinks and a beautiful posy of flowers. You are guided to your suite where your butler, a cool cocktail and canapes awaits and you are given a tour of your duplex suite and instruction on how everything from your laptop to your remote control curtains work! You are then free to expolre this fabulous hotel, we sipped cocktails at the top floor cocktail lounge  and visited the Asawan spa, a mixed pool spa and a female only pool spa that offers fabulous spa/massage treatments at not over the top prices. I had the eye rejuvination treartment one day and body toning treatment the next day and felt fantastic. The pools in both spas are infinity style and have great views over the gulf. We dined at the Al Mahara restaurant on our first night. A submarine simulator transports you down and you enter a magical world of seafood dining. After diner the matre d' gave us a guided tour of the aquarium and private dining rooms. We ordered breakfast in our room the following morning and the waiter set up our dinging table with fresh flowers and a feast! The outdoor pool is a great place to relax with it's swim up bar and cool gulf sea breeze. There are loads of tourist attractions close at hand and the concierge is always on hand to help. We wsnt on the open top bus your round dubai, this stopas at all main attractions and a must see is the al karama market for ”designer” buys! We also went on the sunset sand dune safari - dont miss it! It is also worth taking a taxi to the bustimg al satwar distric for an abundance of restaurants.Taxis are very cheap and plentiful.  Don't be put off by the fact you have a butler on hand they are very helpful and only around when you want them to be.  My only complaint with the Burj  - there should definately be a guest only elevator as several times I had to let packed elevators go by that were full of sightseers!. You cannot buy alcohol in shops or supermarkets in dubai but there is a large reasonable duty free shop at the airport. There are also no bars so most people go to hotel bars for a cocktail. We would definately go back as there is loads to do in this facinating friendly city.

"Annoyed","I stayed here at christmas, standard rooms are the equivelant of standard suites at other hotels but it is probably the most disgustingly decorated hotel in the world. Colors are nightmarish and there is way too much gold. The hotel's self-characterization as a ""7-star"" property is considered by travel professionals and me to be a complete exageration, and an attempt to out-do a number of other hotels which claim ""6-star"" status. All major travel guides and hotel rating systems have a 5-star maximum so this is just a cheap dirty trick. I definetly don't feel I got my $3000 worth.

"Superb","Amazing architectural extravaganza.  Superb service - butler / nannying service etc.  We had 2 floor suite with children.  They have never stopped talking about it.  Over the top luxury and gold everywhere but suspend your taste and enjoy! Spas are sensational and next door to Wild Wadi water park-fab for kids and adults.  Very expensive but worth it.

"Beautiful Burj","My husband and I stayed here for 3 days, 2 nights before going on to the Al Maha and The Ritz Carlton, and I can honestly say it was the most wonderful hotel experience, ever!
We arrived after an overnight flight with Etihad into Abu Dhabi, and after our transfer were still there at least 4 hours before check-in. We needn't have worried. After being greeted by a drink and warm towels we were told our suite was ready, on the 21st floor (actually 42nd in real terms), and were readily whisked upstairs to be checked in at our very own desk. Each floor has its own check in area and concierge, and they were wonderful. Our suite was amazing - floor to ceiling glass with breathtaking views of the sea and the Jumeriah Beach. Once we had got over the inital disbelief at the decor, and were taken upstairs to our bedroom, bathroom and dressing room, we realised that they are not really Ott they are beautiful.The Burj have thought of everything - our complimentary toiletries were 100ml bottles of Hermes products, ranging from Eau de Toilette for me Rocabar Aftershave for hubbie, to shower-gel, body lotion, deodorant, shampoo, conditoner, which our butler pointed out were all ours to keep. I know this is built into the price of the room - but they didnt have to provide such bit bottles! We also received complimentary flip-flops and beach bags.The mini-bar prices are ridiculous, but tea, coffee, juices etc were complimentary when ordered on room service.  The pool area is small in comparison with the size of the hotel, but they have just opened a beautiful pool, exclusiveley for Burj guests adjacent to the Jumeriah Beach Hotel.We decided to eat in the Madinat Jumeriah, the large new hotel complex, which you can get to by ordering a buggy to take you there. We found some lovely restaurants - varying in price, but had all our evening meals there. The cheapest meal in either of the 2 main eateries at the Burj are approx £135.00 pp. There are some things I will pay money for, and others that I wont - and food is one of them. We spent a time on the private beach, and again were looked after is if we were old friends. Nothing is too much trouble, and to be honest, if I could have stayed there for the rest of the holiday I would have. Im a travel agent in the UK, and have often sent customers to this hotel, and wondered wether I would actually enjoy the experience, and I can honestly say we did. It was our 20th wedding anniversary, so we had saved hard for this special holiday, but I would save hard again to go there. Yes drinks are dear, and so is the food, but compared to The Ritz carlton where we spent the last 3 days there wasnt a massive amount of difference. I actually found the ritz to be stuffier and a wee bit unfriendly compared to The Burj. We were relaxed, nobody dresses up to the nines, and I wish we were still there. Dont expect understated decor, dont expect it to be cheap, but just expect to be looked after in this hotel,like you have never been looked after before. We loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!
","5","2006-02"
"Luscious luxury","We stayed here for a week for my 40th Birthday before going on to the Ritz Villas in Bahrain.
I won't waffle on about all the obvious but will just say there is nothing I could fault about the place. The biggest surprise came on my actual birthday. The hotel made a note of my date of birth from my passport when we checked in (unbeknown to us). Then on the said morning a Stunning rose bouquet, huge chocalate cake, champagne and card arrived at our room, all complimets of the Burj. Now that's service!!!!
","5","2005-07"
"My 3rd time at the burj","Been at the Burj in 2000 and 2003 and even now, 2006, it's still unbeaten in its class. 

Had to go for 2 two-bedroom suite with 335m2, because it was fully booked.

Architecture is still incredibly charming, all the colours are well arranged with lots of Gold. The lobby is stunning, staff faboulus trained & motivated to make the guest feel home.

Only drawback is the small spa, have seen better ones. Beach access is rather a long walk, but now beautifully designed (wasn't 3 years ago). 

Also an drawback: all 3 restaurants in the hotel have dress-code, so you have to go to Jumeirah or Madinat for dinner if you dont want to dress up.
","5","2006-03"
"Beautiful hotel!!","My wife took me on a surprise visit to Dubai for my 50th birthday. We stayed at the Oasis Beach for five nights, which was great with a night in between at the Burj Al Arab. I've always admired this fantastic building when it's on the discovery channel on tv, so what a brilliant surprise to actually go and stay in it for a night. 
The hotel staff, which includes your own butler, couldn't do enough for us and were very friendly and respectful. At the pool we were treated like royalty, where they prepared the towels on the comfortable wooden sun beds, they gave you cool cloths to freshen up and also provided bottled water with glasses of ice and evian cool spray. In the suite the butler prepared the jacuzzi with scented oils to the desired temperature and appropriate background music.
The architecture is just out of this world. The suite we were in was on the 16/17 floor as it's in two levels. The lounge and toilet downstairs and the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. It was sheer luxury with fantastic views  -incredible!! The complimentary items included hermes perfume & aftershave, which was a nice touch. The food was great, I even had fillet of beef cutlet at breakfast!
Obviously the price of food and drinks were expensive (e.g. approx. £20 for a budweiser and white wine). We had dinner in the Al Muntaha Restaurant on the 27th floor, which was pricey but great. It was worth it all to have seen and stayed in this fantastic place for a night. What a great unexpected experience!!!
","5","2006-02"
"Careful","I rated this hotel as excellent as everyone does.  But it comes with a warning.  If you have excess amounts of cash that you don't mind frittering away, then by all means stay here.  But don't do it because it is something you only do ""once in a life time"".  I mean, eating chilled monkey's brains is a once in a life time experience too but there is no real logic to doing it.  They overcharge here for everything. 

The rooms are out of this world.  You can see photo after photo and never quite capture the feeling of actually standing in one.  However the remainder of the hotel has a casino feel to it but would not compete in Vegas.

There are no real amenities however.  It is quite claustrophobic actually.  And you pay for every little thing.  Warning:  Don't even open the mini bar.

Eating here is also an exercise in fiscal mismanagement.  The price is not justified by the quality of food nor the service.  Maybe these people are used to serving royalty / celebrity and have no respect for anyone else.

So why the excellent rating?  The rooms.  They are another world. I have never seen anything like it.  And the butler service is above par, even for what you are paying.  It is also an excellent way to impress others who may visit you, so it's good if you are there on business and need to impress.  

There are better hotels overall in Dubai, but none have rooms like this.  If you want luxury but you want to be more sensible with your money, try the Royal Mirage or Madinat jumeirah.

"Fantastic experience","We stayed for 2 nights for our 25th Wedding anniversary, in December, after spending a fantastic 5 nights at the Al Quasr next door.

The Suite at the Burj was outstanding, very opulent and really over the top, exactly what we had expected, and had been looking forward to. Full size Hermes products, including perfume and aftershave in a very beautiful bathroom.

Staff were fantastic, from the chauffeur of the white rolls who presented us with orchids, cold towels and a very warm welcome, to the Butler who was very helpful yet discreet. (Although he never offered to unpack)  We were given wine, flowers, chocolates, cake, card, more handmade sweets, throughout our stay,  we had a beautifully made up bed with single red roses and more chocolates, each night,  we couldnt have been more pampered - it really made the occasion special.

Ate both nights in the hotel,  the restaurant at the top was very 70's  nice atmosphere, average food, cost around £200 but worth it.  The Seafood Restaurant the next night was amazing, (even the submarine ride!)  absolutely fantastic restaurant, a superb gastronomic feast, very befitting for our 25th Anniversary, more expensive than the previous night but well worth it.

We have to go back because I didnt have time to visit the spa, which has been highly recommended.

For a special treat its more than worth a visit.","5","2005-12"
"Wow!","Arriving at the Burj is rather impressive as you drive up the road to the island.  We were greeted at the reception and shown round the hotel lobby we felt relaxed and informed about the hotel and were then shown to our Suite. The next person to greet you is the butler who ran though all the gadgets and there are a few!   We were rather impressed to say the least. I thought the rooms were amazing yes a bit garish but that is what the Burj is all about.  The best thing about it i think are the views from the room top to bottom windows which you can stand in. We didnt have an evening meal at the Burj but we did have breakfast I must say that was the only let down have had alot nicer breakfast elsewhere.  But i think its a must you should have at least one night there and the Jacuzzi bath is great.

"Stunning hotel but lacking  the personal touch","Writing this review directly from the Burj while waiting for the current fog to clear.The weather has been perfect but some fog this morning. Arrived yesterday after staying at Al Qasr for 4 nights we decided to have 1 night at the Burj as it was our anniversary yesterday. Arrived at the hotel courtesy of Al Qasr as Burj forgot to send us their car as they had a conference on. Not the best start as I had ordered the white rolls as a surprise for my husband. The arrival at the hotel was welcoming but hurried as I mentioned they had an important conference taking place. We were shown to our suite and awaiting us was a 2 room suite, we were totally amazed it is fabulous using past and present tenses here because we are still here.. Antony our butler yesteday afternoon showed us around brought us chilled drinks and gave us a tour of our suite. we have 2 beds 2 bathrooms 2 living areas and 1 dining area and kitchen.panoramic views all around . range of luxury hermes goods in bathrooms too many superlatives about the suite itself to mention.
However service here is mixed,Some people greet you some dont. We did not see our evening butler at all  only when I called him in to ask him to clear a dirty tea tray which had not been removed after the room had been made up. Our evening guest services lady Stefanie a German lady was very rude and very unfriendly  when we arrived on our floor yesterday evening after visiting the spa and having afternoon tea instead of welcoming us she asked us what we wanted??? Only after I complained they apologised and said that sometimes visitors wander up to the floors this is totally not acceptable when you have saved hard and are staying here as a guest this should not happen visitors to the hotel should be seperated from the guests of the hotel. In my opinion there are too many visitors wandering around. 
Previous comments from people that the butler offered to run baths unpack cases did not happen to us so I was quite disappointed. We took breakfast this morning outside by the pool in Bab Al Yam it was fantastic wonderful selection of everything you could possibly desire. Staff there warm welcoming and very friendly.
Overall for us this stay in the Burj has been a mixed bag. The hotel itself and the suite is fantastic but it is really the service what makes the stay and this we feel really has let it down for us. At the Al Qasr it couldnt be more different the service is out of this world. it is a truly magical hotel and I am so glad that we will finish off our holiday back there for the next 3 days. Roll on check out time,

"7* Luxury - FANTASTIC","What can I say about the Burj except that it is everything that you have heard about it - it is literally the best hotel in the world!

We were there for 3 nights for our honeymoon on the way back from the Maldives and from the moment we were met at arrivals by our limo driver, rushed through customs and into our waiting Rolls Royce until the time we left the hotel, everything was done for us and we were treated to sheer 7 star luxury.

When you walk through the main front doors, you are sprayed by staff with scented water to cool you down and offered treats on silver platters.

The suite was huge, our personal butler was terrific and organised everything for us and we were given a bottle of wine, basket of fruit and a chocolate cake on arrival as it was our honeymoon. 

Food as you can expect is absolutely outstanding and on our first night, we had cocktails in the Skybar followed by a meal in the restaurant which has a stunning view across Dubai. The prices obviously reflect the prestige to a degree but are well worth it - 4 course meal for two with wine came to about £200 and cocktails were about £10 with a bottle of beer coming in at £7.

In short, it is in a totally different class to any hotel I have ever stayed at before and I am planning to go back again soon. Expensive, yes - worth it, definitely!","5","2005-04"
"The worst hotel I have ever stayed in!!","QUALITY! need i say anymore. make sure you have plenty of money with you. thats the only down side the expense. some of the restaurants aren't that good!
","1","2005-10"
"Amazing..","We stayed at the Burj for 5 nights this October and had read all the reviews etc and can quite honestly say it exceed all our expectations.  The hotel in general is amazing and the suites are stunning. we were totally spoilt. several reviews have stated how expensive the Burj is and while we couldnt dispute that we felt you got a lot for your money so to speak.All the little extras and service. We were very well looked after and enjoyed every minute.  The whole area with the other hotels in the group nearby being accessible via the golf buggies is an added advantage.  The food in the Burj is expensive but with all the other places to eat in the other hotels we felt we had the best of both worlds.  Cant wait to go back..
","5","2005-10"
"the ultimate place to stay","after staying at some of the best hotels the world has to offer, my expectations were high when I reserved a suite at the BAA for the start of our honeymoon.  I have visited Dubai many times over the last 6 years and have stayed a number of times at the Jumeirah Beach hotel opposite, looking up in awe at the amazing structure of the BAA.

we arrived in DXB and were picked up by the BAA's gleaming white rolls royce that whisked us to the hotel in no time...  on arrival we were greated by the welcoming and professional staff and waited for a short while whilst they processed our checkin, skiping the usual formalities of waiting by the reception desk filing in a form etc.    We where then introduced to our butler who showed us round the suite, which was absolutely amazing, if not a bit OTT on the decor front.  Gold everywhere... i loved the plasma screen...  my wife particularly liked the jacuzzi.  we both found the mirror above the bed somewhat kinky but a nice touch ;-)

the restaurants appeared under used, but great food.   the panaromic bar on the top floor is a great place to go to chill out at the end of a busy day on the beach.  The health club / pool within the BAA are also excellent.  The staff were outstanding in all areas of the hotel.  In fact there is very little to dissapoint from our point of view.

overall a fantastic stay and a great way to start a honeymoon.  OK, it's not the cheapest place, but who cares.  you only live once and this is somewhere you should most definitely stay if you intend to spend a luxury few days in DXB.   Enjoy.

"Tacky!","The suite (which my manager had booked for a stay/business meeting) wasn't ready.  We asked for snacks in the public lounge and were served tomato, cucumber and onion sandwiches on bog-standard bread along with diluted orange juice.
The decor is interesting...seems like the hotel was given several options of interior design and decided to use them all at the same time.
Mirror above the bed was very 60's.  Even if it cost a quarter of the price I would not stay there.
","2","2005-07"
"UNBELIEVABLE! A must before you die!","WOW! I was speechless on arriving at this wonderful place. When entering the hotel it took my all to prevent my jaw dropping to the ground. It was not tacky, but glitzy and flash with it's huge aquariams and spectacular water features on arrival. The staff took our passports and checked us in, whilst we were served fresh dates, water and iced flannels while waiting. Our suite was out of this world, I can honestly say that it was bigger than some houses. Many things made me laugh during our stay:
1. On arrival our ""personal butler"" asked whether 
a) we wanted him to unpack our cases straight away or later?
b) what temperature we liked our bath run at!!??
Mad! Our butler was fab. Couldn't have done enough!
Food and drink extremely expensive. The breakfast was included and we feasted on steak fillets, shrimps and various fruit that we had never heard of. If this hadn't been included it would have set us back about £85 each!!!! We did eat in the underwater restuarant on our last night which cost £200  and an expensive bottle of wine at £60. Drinks very expensive with a bottle of larger at £10. My ice cream at the pool cost £10, and with the heat £6 of it fell in the pool. The staff at the pool and the beach were more than helpful, with refills on ice in the glasses of mineral water and fresh iced flannels and yes evian face spray and lavender spray. Don't forget to take your poolside pillow from your pillow menu-yes pillow menu(about 16 choices of pillow).
If you're feeling peckish at lunch you can dine on anything but a burger will set you back £38 or like us you can get one of the golf buggies to take you to the wild Wadi water park for a £3 burger meal!!!!!
The stay was a totally memorable experience that will never be forgotten. Be prepared to pay! But you are staying in a 7star hotel, with a lot of people who can afford to pay £10 a bottle. Definately recommend it. A must before you die!!!!
","5","2005-08"
"Irresistable","We loved this hotel; it has a real wow factor and, for us, was quite irresistible.  The scale and space of the hotel and its suites have to be seen. Decoration is gaudy, glitzy and a little camp!  Staff are friendly, attentive, taking pride in knowing and helping you with holiday arrangements.  This simply isn’t a place to scrimp, resign yourself to a hefty credit card bill and enjoy the opulence.

Some practical points:
Despite what is stated in other reviews the hotel was happy for guests to take photos inside.
Go to the pool in the 18th floor spa, we found it an underused treat.
The seafood restaurant was the only place that didn’t impress us as much as we hoped. We found it expensive and lacking the impact of the rest of the hotel. Mind you, Roger Federer did wander through while we were there.
I couldn’t work out their position on tipping; I gave some tips and watched others tip. Some staff appeared uncomfortable with tips, others not though no-one ‘hovered' or gave any indication of wanting a tip. 
Staff are extremely attentive but equally respect the ‘do not disturb sign’ or a discrete shake of the head.

"Great hotel, average service","The hotel is great.  The room was great.  The service was just average.  Thus, I was disappointed.  For the price I paid, everything should have been PERFECT.  It wasn't.

"Superb hotel bar the Restraunts","I am writing this review while sitting at the study desk, using the supplied laptop in our suite in Burj Al Arab.
You may be wondering why I am writing a review on this hotel while staying at such a wonderful, the answer to this question is simple !
I am waiting for my wife to get ready for dinner.

Anyhow, we are regular visitors to Dubai & we usually stay in Jumeirah Beach Hotel as we have 2 young children.
This visit it is just my wife & I, for 3 nights only.

From the moment we got picked up at the airport in a white Rolls Royce, the experience was superb.
As you are greeted in the RR, cold hand towels & bottled water is handed to you, while my wife was presented with a well presented flowerin an attractive presentation box.

After we arrived we were whisked up to our suite immediately no hanging around for the room to be ready.

The butler greeted us on our suite floor & showed us around the suite which is just out of this world, I doubt you will find a better (normal charge) suite anywhere in the world.

A huge plasma screen/jacuzzi/study with laptop & internet access and acres of room awaits you.
There is even a pillow menu with a vast selection of pillows awaiting your decision.

The suite was very comfortable & had everything you could think of.

The one thing we were worried about was that it just may be too stuffy for us, how wrong I could be, there was a very relaxed atmosphere everywhere we went.

The only complaint I had was the Al Muntaha restraunt on the 27th floor, it was exceptionally expensive & the food was not very good.

This put us off eating in the hotel restraunts again for dinner opting for Gordon Ramseys Verre & Jumeirah Beach La Parilla instead.

To summarise: a wonderful stay in a wonderful hotel.
Just go & eat dinner elsewhere as there are better restraunts available in Dubai & not as pricey.

"Highly disappointed with the Burj Al Arab","This my seem a Shock review to all, in comparison to the 5 star ratings it has received so far. However me and my wife had a nightmare for the short duration that we stayed here. The first problem was the bath, which for some reason ceased to supply any water when needed! This also surprised the bath assistant, but it still took a good 24 hours for it to be  rectified! The second incident was with room service meal. Upon presentation of the meal we found a piece of meat in the salad although we had asked for a veggie option, which upset my wife as she is a strict vegetarian. The last and final straw came when we were charged extra for the meal as they stated that we had ordered a meat dish even though it was confirmed earlier on that we hadn't! What can I say..........7 stars of pure rubbish! I'd rather stay at dehli darbar hotel which I find to be amongst the best in the world.
","1","2005-03"
"Lived up to expectations","Our stay in the Burj Al Arab came at the end of our honeymoon, during which we stayed in some of the best hotels the world has to offer. I was a bit nervous about staying there as my expectations were so high, especially after our stays in other hotels, it is a large hotel and could such a large hotel have excellent service with a personal feel? The answer is yes! No matter how you feel about the opulence of the hotel you can't help but go WOW when you go upstairs to the lobby and when you see your suite. We found the staff friendly, personal and engaging while the service was excellent. We had a spa treatment and the infinity pools there on the 18th floor are well worth the trip! The Seafood restaurant has excellent food but is expensive. The breakfast was excellent and the Sky restaurant was the best. It is less formal then the seafood restaurant but the food is just as good and more reasonable. I was not dissapointed and it was a fitting end to the most amazing honeymoon.
","5","2005-07"
"Amazing room,s but over the top","Stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms are fantastic, every luxury you could think of, the hotel is also out of this world will all of the facilities you would ever need, and more.

We just found it TOO much, with someone knocking on your door every 2 minutes asking if you wanted your bath run, your beds made, more ice, etc etc. I understand that thid hotel has to give good serices, but this was too much. In the end, we put the do not disturb sign on the door to keep them away.

I dont regret going here, it was an amazing experience, but I wouldnt go again.
","5","2005-07"
"7 Star Rating is well deserved","As a regular business traveller who spends 4 months a year travelling extensively, I thought I had seen it all.....until I stayed at this Hotel.
The service here is truly out of this world with the Hotel employees being particularly impressive in every aspect of their duties. The Waiters at breakfast do everything for you bar actually eat the food for you. As for the Butler service, well, if insisting on walking you down 24 flights of stairs during a  Dubai power cut (the first power cut the city has had in 10 years I am told) was not enough then the offer of running our baths, packing / unpacking our suitcases and bringing unprompted various refreshments to our suite on a regular basis every evening certainly did it for us. The suites are superb and luxurious in the extreme and the restaurants are truly first class with the delightfully tasting food being well worth the hefty pricetag. The internal decoration and ambience of the lobby has to be seen to be believed and the Pool Staff certainly wore out their shoe leather with the constistent bringing of water, evian face sprays, ice cold flannels and fruit platters.  
It is indeed difficult to find any fault with the Burj although most of us will eventually run out of money if we stay here too often.
The unofficial billing of this Hotel being 7 star is entirely accurate - in my opinion it is indeed 2 notches above a typical 5 star Hotel such as a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons for example, if that is possible. Treat yourself  to a truly memorable experience and stay here before Dubai gets too overcrowded.

"Total Luxury","This hotel exceeds our expectations every time we go. This was our second visit, and this time my boyfriend/lover surprised me with the presidential suite. It was fantastic. Every luxury your could imagine was there. I never even had to draw my own bath! And the tub jets - oooooooh! It was a surprise birthday get away - and what a surprise it was. I thought the one bedroom was grand - this far surpassed that. I have to say - the food was out of this world. Very delicious. The service - spectacular. Bruce has very over the top tastes, and likes ""certain things"" while away on vacation - this hotel caters to your every whim - no questions asked. If you want it - they will find it. You pleasure is their mission.

"Loved the Burj","My husband and I just returned from a week in Dubai the end of May and we absolutely loved the city.  We spend the first night at the Hilton Dubai Creek due to a late night arrival, followed by four nights at the One and Only Royal Mirage and two nights at the Burj Al Arab.  The Hilton is nice but more of a business hotel and due to street construction all around it it is difficult to walk outside the hotel.  I would recommend going directly to the Jumeirah Beach area.  The Royal Mirage was fabulous - great pool and beach area as well as excellent restaurants.  We had a club level beach front suite that was luxurious.  Then on to the Burj Al Arab, which to us deserved even more than seven stars.  The building itself is one of Dubai's top attractions.  It was truly the best hotel, in every respect, that we have ever stayed at in the world.  The attitude of the staff and service level could not possibly be any better and the food was among the best we've ever eaten.  The suites and common hotel areas are exquisite.  I can't say enough about the experience; it was worth every dollar.  As regards the Jumeirah Beach area in general it is beautiful but you cannot walk from hotel to hotel on the street due to distance and the construction of the Palm and World Islands prevents beach walking due to construction.  Also if you are traveling as a couple be careful where you stay; many hotels are family oriented and the pools are packed with children.  We took the East Coast tour - very interesting and worthwhile - and the dune bashing/dinner, which was only so-so.  If you enjoy a convoy of 25 4 wheel vehicles traveling together and then meeting up with 3 other same sized groups for dinner, then go for it!  It was mass market at it's worst!!  The food and belly dancing were very good however.
","5",
"The Burj is Dubai","Stay if you can at this spectacular hotel.  The stunning sailboat styled architecture and all round Dubai icon does not prepare the visitor for what lies inside.  Yes, this hotel is monumentally vulgar and over the top. One would expect the Beckhams to have played a consultancy role with the interior decor! However, you are in Dubai and this hotel says (nay positively screams) it all. If you want less ostentation and the unrivalled service of the champions of luxury hotels then Ritz Carlton is, in the end, a more fulfilling experience. But, it is too easy to take a swipe at this fabulous hotel. Like many other reviewers here, my wife and I have have been lucky enough to stay in some top hotels. The Burj Al Arab is the best we have ever luxuriated in. We booked through Expedia and paid 426 pounds a night, including a magnificent breakfast at the Bab Al Yam restaurant. Yes, it is huge money but we didn't feel in the least overcharged. Indeed, the hotel was fully booked on the two nights we stayed.
You do not stay in a hotel room. The suites at the Burj are not about providing an extra chair or more desk space. A basic suite is like entering a palace. The amount of space has to be seen to be believed. Your suite is on 2 levels, linked by a sweeping staircase (What? No personal lift?) and it would take too long to list the many outstanding features of this hotel. The 11 telephones in each suite probably sums it all up. The mountainous fruit bowl, the remote controlled curtains, the projected clock on the wall, the thunderous sound system, the spot on air conditioning, the bed from heaven, complete with naughty ceiling mirror and my own personal favourite as a computer technophobe, an IT butler are my own stand out favourites. The Burj is Dubai. Stay (not visit) if you can.

","5","2005-06"
"The Ultimate Luxury","I'm a jaded traveler and I admit it, but I was wowed by the Burj al Arab--wowed by the place, wowed by the view, wowed by the decor and wowed by the price.  We stayed in a ""panaramic suite"" and it surely was.  The $1000 per night rate is extremely steep but this is truly one of those ""once in a lifetime"" experiences.  

The Al Muharra restaurant is also great.  If you're a couple, ask to sit at one of the tables for two next to the aquarium.

The other restaurants in the hotel are riduculously expensive for what you get--$48 hamburger, for example.  Also, avoid the mini bar in the room.  In my opinion, if you're paying $1000 per night for a room, they shouldn't charge you $6.50 for a coke!","5",
"Spectacular and Special","I have just returned from what in my opinion is the best hotel in the world!
I travelled with my wife and 2 year old son and we had a magnificent time. 
All the reviews I read prior to travel somewhat prepared me for the Burj but my expectations were exceeded! 

I've been fortunate to have stayed in some beautiful hotels around the world. The Burj beats them all! I have stayed in the Honeymoon suite at the Renaissance Ilikai on Waikkiki beach Hawaii, Hyatt Regency Gainey Ranch in Phoenix, Arizona, the Sugar Beach resort in Mauritius,  the Don Cesar in St. Petersburg, Florida and in the Presidential Suite at the Registry resort, Naples Florida but nothing can compare to the Club Suite at the Burj al Arab that I have just enjoyed! 

What makes a class hotel? It helps if it has a monumental design, good facilities, clean, restaurant etc but I think that the most important thing for any holiday maker is SERVICE.

This is where the Burj excells. Anything from cold towels and ice water by the pool to providing my son with beach toys and a football when we visited the beach. NOTHING was too much trouble and the most satisfying thing about it was that the staff members, and I mean ALL of them, see making guests as comfortable as possible as their goal and not only in the hope of a large tip! 

After leaving the beach (The Burj's private section of beach) I spoke with who I presume was the manager of the beach staff and expressed that after having such a lovely meal there and them making a particular effort to ensure that my son was fully occupied and comfortable that I'd like to tip the particular member of staff who had been looking after us. His reply was simple and polite...."" Sir, we just want all of our guests to be happy. We do NOT want a tip because we know that you'll visit us again if we treat you right whilst you are here! We just want you to be happy with our service!!!!""  

I can imagine that some people may be slightly uncomfortable having their own butler and other hotel staff generally falling over to make sure that they are totally satisfied with any aspect during their stay. I, for one, absolutely love that kind of treatment and I'll be going back to the Burj as soon as possible. 7 star luxury, excellent service and polite, helpful, friendly hotel staff. The Burj is THE place where all this is guaranteed.
","5","2005-04"
"You will be amazed at this place!!","If you can afford it, book it, it is an amazing out of this world experience.  I stayed there for the first three nights on my honeymoon enroute to Mauritius and I can't stop thinking about the place I am desperate to go back.  I spent one day round the pool, pure relaxation and pampering, and two full days at Wild Wadi Water Park, which was unbelievable and I can't wait to go back.  We did get an afternoon at the Burj Al Arab's beach, which was the nicest beach, cleanest, beach I have been to (and I have travelled extensively), the sea is so warm it is like a bathtub and there is a lifeguard in a canoe out in the sea as well as one on a tower.  You feel extremely looked after and catered for for every single second of your holiday but left in peace when needed.  I loved it.
","5","2004-09"
"Words cannot describe how fantastic this hotel is!","Every experience at this hotel is 7*. Check in is very swift and we were allowed in our room at 7.30am. They upgraded us to a Panoramic suite, wow, and wished me Happy Birthday as it was that day. I also received flowers, cake, wine and card from the manager. The room is unbelievable and massive on two floors - glass windows from floor to ceiling on both walls. Remote control blinds. Great view over looking Jumeriah Beach hotel. 24 hour butler. Full size Hermes toiletries. Laptop and internet. Plasma tv with DVD player. Fresh fruit is plentiful. We also ate in the roof top restaurant which was good and not as expensive as expected. Great views. Wild Wadi water park is a must! Best there is as you don't have to walk up any stairs. You float around in a rubber ring and you get rushed UP water shoots to the top of rides. Very exhilterating ... ladies hang on to your bikini bottoms. You don't need to take any money as you can credit wrist bands and it's charged to your room. Going back Sept 2005 - can't wait. The pool area is very quiet. The pool attendant lays out towels on the bed when you arrive, brings glasses of iced water, wet flannels and lavender spray. Was great but did prefer the pool at Jumeriah Beach hotel as livlier or the water park ... but what a life.","5","2004-09"
"Fantastic Experience","The Descriptions of the rooms have already been covered and they are all correct it is a fantastic hotel.  We stayed there for part of our honeymoon and the service is beyond anything you can imagine.  Is is not true to say that the hotel is not for families our 12 year was treated exactly like an adult with the butler coming to the door asking to speak to her about what she would like.  After which she ended up with a play station, selection of games and DVD's her own mini sized bathrobe and slippers and toiletries.

We ate in the underwater restaurant and it is expensive without a doubt but it's something that's got to be done. 

Ok so it is expensive but worth it for a special occasion and it's very nice to be able to go over the bridge and know you are staying there while  the lobby is full of people who go just to see inside.

"Star Status","We stayed at the Burj Al Arab for 4 nights in September 2004.

No pictures can give you an idea of the luxury of this hotel.  You just have to stay there to experience it for yourself!

The room we had was a standard suite.  Downstairs yes....downstairs we had a laptop for our use with broadband.  A plasma screen TV with dvd, which had a remote control which operated the curtains upstairs and down and also the security camera on the door.  If someone rang the bell, their image shows on the screen and you press a button on the remote to let them enter.  Clever!  The room was very luxuriously decorated and had floor to ceiling windows up and down.  With a great view of the Palm which they are now building.

We had complimentary wine, fruit, biscuits and dates!  Not to mention the toiletries.  Hermes perfume, aftershave, shower gel, body lotion and much more.

Our butler and concierge knew both our names immediately and as I was travelling with another female they knew which was which.  I thought that was brilliant.  We could change money with the concierge although it was cheaper at the shopping mall.

When we returned to our room at the end of the night, our slippers were put out next to the bed along with a plastic box containing a chocolate and artificial flower, each night a different colour.

We attended the Hotel Manager's welcoming cocktail party which was a good chance to view the other guests and decided who was with who for the money - you know 25 year old with 60 year old etc.  Free canapes and drinks for the duration!!!

During the day the pool area was quite quiet.  Before you even put your belongings on the sun lounger the attendant places the towel out for you and returns with glasses of water, lavender mist sprays and cold wet towels.  I was born for this treatment.  It really is 7* luxury.

The fish restaurant (supposedly underwater)  was expensive, you can order separate items from the menu or the whole 12 courses or whatever it is.  As it was my first time I ordered all the courses!!!  The bill was expensive but who cares.  It was a one-off.  The food was excellent but I think we may have upset the chef as we didn't have a clue what wine went with what and ordered something at the wine waiter's discretion.  To get down to the restaurant you enter a submarine simulator which is an utter waste of time and complete embarrassment to you and the operator.

Do not miss the Wild Wadi Water Park which is free to guests.  As you leave the hotel the doorman will summon a golf buggy which takes you there ( they can also take you to the Jameirah Beach Hotel).  You have to get a wrist band as you go in and put money onto it for your lunch and locker etc.  

This is no ordinary water park.  Where you would climb stairs to get to various slides here you don't!  You pick up your tube and the water pushes you up to the top of the slide it's fantastic, but you could lose your bottoms and end up with a sore backside.  The surf ride is brilliant to watch but you queue for 10 mins to be thrown off after 1 second it is really hard to master.

Dubai itself is a strange place due to religious drinking laws etc and there is no 'strip' of bars or restaurants everything is hotel based and you can't walk from one to the other.  The Burj is situated on Jameirah Beach so can be half an hour or more taxi ride to Souks and Shopping Malls.

The Jumeirah Beach Hotel has a great restaurant (can't remember the name -sorry) but as you put your handbag on the floor the waitress emerges with a red heart-shaped cushion for it - fantastic.  I love stuff like that.  The nightclub is also quite good, although DJ didn't do requests and I wanted bit more R 'n' B.

Treat yourself to this hotel.  It is expensive but it's an experience in itself.

No-one famous as most of them travel in by helicopter except 50 cent apparently who had large entourage and made a big show of getting limousines.

"over rated!","sorry, everyone on here is going to go mad now! but i dont like this hotel, it is very over the top, if you the Beckham's taste then you will like it. of course the rooms/staff/views/facilities are fantastic but it is a bit too formal...i would say families are a no-go...although you can use the Jumeirah Beach facilities which is very family orinated.
    as an alternative i would say go to the one & only royal mirage, al qasr (which opened in aug 04), mina a salam. 
    just incase some travel agents dont tell you - there is alot of building work on the beach area, but it wont affect your holiday.

"Attention to detail is second to none","I am a regular visitor to Dubai and ex-resident, so when it came to celebrating our Silver Wedings it could only be the Burj. Spent 7 days last June and while I did not publicise that we were on our Silver Wedding the word got out from some of our local friends; consequently the hotel made our stay very special (although I suspect they treat all guests like that).  Everything was perfect, breakfast is really something else. The pool area is quite small but attendants keep you stocked up with plenty of iced bottled water (free) and cooling face sprays. As previously said the suites are fully loaded. One thing of note that after day 1 we were always addressed by name! They must have a good briefing session in the morning. Could not be better, and shop around for best rates. Also Duabi maybe in the Middle East but it is not dry, no street bars but plenty bars in hotels and clubs, you can also buy 4 x items (4 x bottles or 4 x1/2 case of beer) per person at the arrivals duty free.

"7 star in every sense of the word","My husband and I stayed at the 'Burj' for the first leg of our honeymoon and what a fantastic start.  It was everything we expected and more.  The staff were especially friendly and helpful, no matter what was requested from them.  

Although dinner in 'Al Mahara' was expensive, you get what you pay for.  We paid approx $250, including a few glasses of wine, but it was supberb and worth every penny.

The pool area was particularly windy, something I have heard said before from a friend so hold onto your drinks.

The buffet breakfast was a delight, so much choice you could have stayed all day and still not sampled everything on offer.

This is most definately a 7 star hotel, in every sense of the world, well worth a visit, even for a short break.

"Excellent","We stayed here for 7 nights on our honeymoon and thought it was wonderful - excellent service and tasty food (although a bit pricey).
The rooms sorry suites have all the latest gadgets and you receive canapes and drinks every evening. As it was our honeymoon I recieved a big bunch of roses, bottle of champagne and a luxurious chocolate cake covered in edible gold leaf!
most hotels are 5*+ in dubai but this really is the business, I would definately go there again and again!

"Out of this world!!!!","My husband and I stayed at the Burj for 5 nights in April 2004.  We had seen and read so much about the hotel we had to try it out for ourselves. The welcome was fantastic and the check in directly in the suite made it nice and private. The views from the suite were amazing. We were allowed to take pictures anywhere in the hotel.  The spa was beautiful with the pool looking out over Dubai. The room was always clean, new treats everyday including complimentary everything!!  We took the Desert Jeep Safari one afternoon and had a blast. Scary but wonderful.  The restaurants are great.
Would go back anytime and recommend this hotel to everyone!

"Heaven on earth","My wife our 2 sons and I stayed at burj in August. We were expecting it to be good but were amazed at how good it really was.
From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty.  As regards the children, aged 2 and 4 years the had the time of their lives. So often hotel staff treat children as an annoyence, how ever the staff at Burj treated them as visitors in their own right.  Nothing was too much trouble.
The food was excellent and the room service as you would expect always ensured that extra touch.  
As regards relaxing, at the outside pool, we were continually provided with sun barriers and water sprays.
You also have free access to the water park to pass the time 
Everything about the burj excellent - my personal recommendation is that you can not judge other hotels until you have experience this

"Awesome experience of a lifetime!","From the Rolls Royce pick-up w/ the chauffer bearing orchids, the nice welcoming committee to the excellent check-in service on your suite floor our experience started in grand style. I've read a lot about the Burj but being actually there was unbelievably impressive. Our panoramic suite was so royal and plush, took us all day to absorb it all. My husband and I  stayed for 2 days and just immersed ourselves with pure luxury. Massage in their excellent spa, breakfast by the pool, the water park, and touring the other surrounding hotels. Very good service. All the hotel employees aimed to please us. The restaurant on the top floor was very expensive as expected, so just sit at the lounge for cocktail, and ride the golf cart to Mina Salam and take a tour on the abras where the souks and more affordable restuarants are spread out.  From then on no other hotel will ever compare the excellence of the Burj. I'd be willing to share some specific tips or detailed advise to those planning to stay at the Burj or just visit Dubai.

"Overwhelming - Fantastic!!","My husband and I stayed for 1 night while in Dubai for a few days. We absolutely loved it! It is a fantastic hotel - so amazing that we were really overwhelmed when we were taken to our suite. We went for my 30th birthday to celebrate, and the hotel was great to me on my birthday - personal birthday wishes, roses and a cake - so unexpected, but really sweet!! Its an amazing hotel - both in the Lobby and the suites, and we were pleasantly surprised to be given a suite upgrade on arrival because the hotel was at capacity!! We were so  sad to leave, that we would definitely come back again - both to Dubai and the Burj
","5",
"absolutley fabulous","my husband son and i spent 1 night at the burj to celebrate my 40th whilst on holiday in dubai. Words can not describe how fantastic the hotel is. The suite was beyong belief, but i must say that the food we ate was not as good as that at the Le meridien where we spent the rest of our holiday. A burger at the poolside was £26.00 and a glass of bubbly was £30, but it was an experience and i would return again tommorow.

"Too Flashy - Not the best hotel in Dubai by far","The Burj was a big disappointment to us. While it looked magnificent from the outside, we found it to be too flashy from the inside. The colours were very 60s. You'd almost expect Austin Powers to appear shouting ""Shagadelic"" any minute. Not my style at all. It is also way too expensive for what it offered: no direct beach access from the hotel, snooty staff, average food for extravagant prices. What I found to be quite annoying was that guests were not allowed to take pictures in the skybridge bar, or anywhere else in the hotel besides the bedroom. Oh, and the bedroom had a mirrored ceiling - Pleeeaaase! Dubai has many excellent hotels to choose from such as Dar Al Messyaf, Jumeirah Beach Hotel, Jumeirah Beach Club and of course the Royal Mirage. Stay at any of these hotels and stop at the Burj to watch the magnificent view and have a cocktail at the Skybridge Bar. You'll get a much better value for your money.","3",
"Out of this world","Staying in this hotel was an unforgettable experience. It is worth every single penny, a truely once in a lifetime experience. Service is amazing, the facilities the best I've ever seen and the building itself is breathtaking.

If only we'd stayed a week rather than just one night!
","5",
"A little over-rated!!","Yes this is a wonderful hotel but I think a lot depends on what you're used to. My husband and I stayed for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and they did provide us with some little extras for this (wine, cake) which were great but no more than we'd received from the city hotel we stayed in first. We've travelled the world extensively and if you're used to 5* in the Far East then you're not really going to get much more. The suite was huge with every gadget available but again if you're used to staying in suites the only difference is that their's are more opulent. My only criticism is with the restaurant - we dined in the Al-Muntaha (on the 27th floor) and we've certainly had better for a lot less. We had a main course each with the smallest glass of wine you've ever seen and this cost £100!!! The cost would have been OK if it was the best food we'd ever eaten but it wasn't and the portions were miniscule. If you do want to eat in the hotel go to the Al-Iwan which, although buffet style, was excellent. Would we go again - no, but we're glad we tried it.

"Not for the faint hearted","The Burj is what is says it is. The world's most luxurious hotel...but at a cost. A beer is £7 and a glass of champage will set you back £30. Not for the faint hearted. However the rooms are spectacular with bells and whistles galore. The lobby is stylish and jawdropping, the Al Mahara is a great restaurant but again, is tough on the wallet (£300 for 2 with wine). The Hotel has a strict dress code (no shorts after 6pm) and gentlemen cannot remove their jackets at dinner - this can seem a little stiffling if you are there on a relaxing holiday.

The Burj is unique and worth staying a couple of nights just to savour the experience and the glamourous surroundings......Be sure to take the Rolls to the airport when you leave.
","5",
"Warning! Do not entrust your credit card","Hotel OK. But I gave my credit card at the outset and then paid when I left; three weeks later the authorisation they took initially was still blocking out my card, so I could not use it. Seven phone calls to Dubai later and I am still waiting. 

Be warned. Do not leave without seeing them remove the authorisation first. Or pay by cash; or stay somewhere better, like Sandy Lane, Barbados.
","1",
"Absolute splendour","Stayed at the Burj for 3 nights in Aug. If anyone is wondering about staying at this hotel, but unsure about the cost and whether its all worth it, (as many a good hotel can be found on Jumeirah Beach), dont hesitate, book up now and GO!!!!

There are great hotels all around the world, 5 star, 6 star, whatever the star, the Burj is a total one off, and an unforgettable experience.

The whole place is like walking around in a dream. Over the top, lavish colours, gold everywhere, but it works. I could write pages about the interior but i'll cut straight to the rooms,..sorry suites. As you walk in, the shear size and splendour hits you. They are immaculate, and look unused and brand new. As you probably know, the 'standard' deluxe suite has 2 levels (as all suites do), upstairs/downstairs toilet/ bathroom, 42"" plasma, DVD, surround sound, laptop, bar, elec curtains, separate dressing area..etc. I challenge you not to feel a little emotional as you're shown round the suite by your butler.

Little extras like, bottle of wine,boxes of arabic sweets and dates, surprise drinks and nibbles/chocolates brought to your room every evening, hermes products in the bathroom, that are yours to keep, no small throw away bottles, proper sized, shampoo/aftershave/purfume/body lotion bottles.

On a wed and sun, the hotel manager will invite you to a cocktail party on the 17th floor, where you have a chance to talk to him and his staff. Drink and food is complimentary all evening.

The only minor drawback i felt was the small pool area, but thats the design of the Burj, and the staff there look after you very well, and it never got over crowded. One tip, if a larger pool you want , then goto the Al Qasr across the road...amazing place!!

Lastly, dont be put off by thinking the Burj is a stuffy place, yes its 7 star, and you can certainly feel the wealth of the place, but its friendly and welcoming, and you feel very relaxed there, no need to pretend you're something you're not!!!!!","5",
"First impressions - WOW!","This is one hotel you must stay in during your lifetime.   We stayed here for our first wedding anniversary following a week in the Maldives. 

We booked via Cresta Worldwide and got transferred to the hotel via Arabian Adventures in a minibus - this is not the sort of transport you should really be turning up in to a hotel of this class!!

After our initial greeting, we were shown to our suite on the 12th floor and the butler showed us around stating how the remote control worked from whereever you were in the suite (however you did get 2 though - 1 for upstairs as well as downstairs).   The suites are lovely and a very impressive size with lots of space for the two of you to rattle around in.   We were given a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival and canapes and a drink were brought to your suite everyday in the late afternoon unless you put your do not disturb on. 

We ate in Al Muntaha restaurant at the top of the hotel and the views were magnificent but we did not get a table near the window despite requesting it.   The only thing that let this restaurant down was the rather surly waitress who looked down her nose at us when I asked for my duck to be cooked well done instead of rare.   However, we were given a gorgeous chocolate cake at the end of our meal for our anniversary and as we were so full, requested that it be taken down to the suite and we consumed it the next day. 

We were at the hotel on the a B&B basis and the breakfast on the first floor could not be faulted with the most fabulous buffet choices I have ever seen eaten. 

The butlers and reception staff on your floor could not be more helpful and escorted us to the restaurant and the managers cocktail party on our last evening in the hotel.    We had a fabulous aromatic jacuzzi run for us.  

The golf carts were extremely useful and would take you to any of the local Jumeriah resorts and take photos of you if you wished too. 

We had a 4am checkout and the continental breakfast provided was lovely.   Considering we only had about 20 minutes before our transport arrived, the presentation by the waitress was fantastic. 

Overall, a wonderful place with excellent service and fantastic attention to detail by all staff.   Definitely recommended

"'Wow'","Amazing.  What a place to spend a few nights (simply because you couldnt afford to spend longer there!)  The colour schemes are the most hideous, over the top mixtures you could ever come accross, but yet they make it stunningly incredible.  It is luxury in a category of its own.  You can have your luggage packed and unpacked, and your bath run for you.  The service is truly amazing.  From the concierge who remembered my sons name immediately, and greeted him with a huge smile and 'high fives' every time we went through the door, to the beach staff, who were preparing our sun beds, towels, water to drink and spray and napkins, as we walked over the sand.  The staff here have exceptional training.  I could write pages about it!  It is truly a hotel that should be visited at least once in a lifetime.

"Live like a movie star!","Uppers: Most incredible service, fabulous space/gadgetry/privacy in your room, REALLY fantastic Spa...and everything else!

Downers:  A little too Las Vegas in the decor, service can be cloying if you're not used to it. The cost!

Very impressive!  We stayed 3 nights in June 2004 and were completely overwhelmed by the whole thing!  We were on Honeymoon and had just come from a week in the African Bush on Safari...Arrival was the most painless ever - we were met directly off our 5am flight by a wide awake suited concierge guy, who escorted us through customs and immigration (a first - and excellent queue jumping!) and out to the awaiting air-conditioned Rolls Royce (£45 each way direct with the hotel - get it for at least the arrival - it's really worth it!), with roses and ice cold flannels and water - needed after that night flight from Jo'burg!  Check-in (and out) in-suite, quick tour from the Butler, then we were left to our own devices!  

Can't get better than that, and in the room there were more flowers, chocolates, fruit, wine, glasses of champagne, a fabulous Patissiere cake, and then canapes or petit fours every day!  Check their website for the rooms, they really do look like that!  

Restaurants are naturally as hideously priced as the hotel...I'd definately recommend room service which was great and the pretend-underwater restaurant, they have the coolest china, and the seafood really was very good - although I've had better (for a similar price).  The seafood restaurant outside on the Quay had excellent seafood but mediocre to terrible service.  

The pool area is spectacular, poolside service like that you will never see, evian spays, water, drinks, fresh towels, umbrella up/down/moved...very, very good, except when it's busy, then you can be passed by if you aren't famous...  

Too hot in June for sure, even in the shade it's too hot after 11am.  Really the service was excellent - I left my diamond earrings in the bathroom, only realising at the airport, and liasing with the Dubai Duty Free Customer Service, the Burj sent a guy to bring them to me!  

On reflection, we should've done Dubai first, before the South African Bush - we suffered opulence overload!  It's how I imagine movie stars to live - anything you want, right away, and on a silver platter.

If we ever went back to Dubai we would stay at the Madinat Jumeirah, very Arabian, or the Jumeirah Beach Club - small and intimate.  Jumeirah Beach hotel I'd recommend for families - it was overrun with kids having a great time (not very peaceful) and it's huge, felt like Benidorm.  

If you visit the Wild Wadi water park (which is GREAT!) I'd recommend VERY STRONGLY that ladies of all ages/shapes/sizes wear leggings and a T-shirt over your swimsuit..that's what all the local girls are wearing and the men leer openly, it's very disturbing - and don't go on a Friday (the Sunday equivalent).

"Unforgettable hotel fantasy","I had 3 nights in Dubai just to stay at the Burj.  The city is hideous and failed to meet expectations.  The hotel is a fantasy enclave and topped expectations: this is not a mere upgrade from 5-star, but in a class of its own, starting from the choreographed lobby fountain.  I took a panoramic suite, all 2700 sq ft meaning acres of carpet (compared to your usual 400 sq ft 5-star hotelroom) which all occupy the corners of this unique tower's dominating structure.  Due to the bowing outwards, the biggest panoramic suites are floors 8-15.  (The website quotes around £750 per night but I got a package equating to £420 per night.) The top to bottom glass walls over 2 levels give a stratospheric view of the ocean one side and flat relatively unenchanting cityscape the other.  Unlike the standard duplex, these are open plan suites with similarly luxurious furnishings (the gold fitments are confined to the royal floor), bar, business centre (incl laptop) and huge jacuzzi bathroom with unlimited Hermes and Rocabar products.  Sailing up and down the sweeping staircase, it took an hour to get familiar with everything escorted round by a check-in page.  Each floor of 14 suites has a 24 hr rota of tailcoated butlers endlessly at your service (so you don't have to tip any individual if you don't want to).  The squint down the world's biggest atrium is vertiginous - partly due to the universally psychedelic decor.  Staff are unctuous, especially in the restaurants where you need hardly lift a finger.  Of course the 27th floor eatery's view is a tourist attraction but the food standard, though good enough, is nothing special.  Likewise the 'subterranean' seafood restaurant which, at  basement level, is descended by a fake submarine capsule with crap underwater video graphics.  I just remember the lounges, the gorgeous spa/swimming pool complex, the gadget-littered suite - and of course, the complimentary wine, and boxes of dates and sweetmeats which gave a heartening welcome.  Yet in Dubai they're planning something even more bizarre...","5",
"Pretty Classy. . .","Well, I just found this review site and did a search for Burj where we stayed for 2 nights in 2001 I think. We'd been in the Maldives and came here to finish things off for a few nights. Because Maldives are very layed back, we felt very underdressed. This place is definately not a casual kind of place and the guests will definately be checking you out. What can I say. The hotel is amazing! It really is. The standard duplux rooms are huge and no expense has been spared. Yes, the Hermes products from the bathroom are pretty neat and our bulter showed us some of the VERY expensive suites for royalty and such. It took a bit of getting used to the huge mirror above the bed, though :)

The views out the window are stunning but if I had one complaint I'd have to say the service was too over the top. For instance, I've just come from the swimming pool (infinity style with the sides right up to the window!) and as I take off my swimsuit there's a guy there waiting to deposit my wet swimsuit in a classy little Burj bag! I mean, come on. I thought he was about to towel me dry! The hotel restaurants are varied and very good. The ""submarine"" ride to one of their restaurants was very different and fun. There are very good deals to be had off-season when it is like, 43 degrees outside. Be very careful of cameras. Going from air-conditioned to blast-furnace, you'll get condensation forming in your camera - NOT good! Having concierge on each floor is VERY handy. They'll take care of anything for you. There were treats in our room all the time and it was a very special place but not chilled relaxing but everything over the top and an amazing way. Would I go back. Of course.

"Happy Burjday","I was surprised by my wife with a night at the Burj for my birthday. I can not say enough good things about this place. (as price implies $800US) We were in dubai for 2 weeks with a friend who works there and we were picked up by the Rolls Royce at his villa (small fee for being out of downtown) and the driver was so professional and came bearing roses for my wife. He pointed out places of interest as we drove and when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by no less than 6 people to get our bags and escort us inside. They all greeted us by name and welcomed us (nice touch) Two more people greeted us inside and offered us a hot towel to refresh ourselves after our long journey (all of 25 minutes but good for air travellers) and the best almond stuffed dates I ever had, only one actually. haha You do not check in as you arrive, you are shown around the breath-taking atrium area and go to your room floor to check in at a desk near the elevator. This is the person who takes care of anything you may need during your stay. This is the best system ever for checking in, for the sake of a few extra people, you just don't have any line up. We were shown to our room and it's features and were introduced to our butler, he was bearing gifts as well. There was a bottle of wine and canapes waiting for us and my wife sniffed out the chocolates (mmmmm) in the leather bound box. This place has everything, it would take days to describe the whole stay even though it was only a day. Short version: bedrooms were oppulent and had the most amazing view of Dubai. Bathrooms were awesome and if you like Hermes products you have your pick. Spiral marble staircase up to the bedroom is a photo op you must take a picture of. Living room was huge and has the same floor to ceiling views as the bedroom. Computer office area is great to email people to tell how fantastic the place is. Gadgets for curtains, info, and plasma screen t.v.'s Butler is at your beckon call. When we went to the aquarium style restaurant, no sooner were we out the door than another guy greeted us and asked if he could escort us to the restaurant for dinner. They know what you want before you do. The meal was expensive but was worth every penny, the 4 of us were totally in awe. And as an added surprise the chef made a special little gourmet cake/dessert for my birthday. All the facilities are second to none and most employees have been there since the first day so they are all very well trained. There were some VIP milling around but most of the time you have complete privacy and freedom. The bar at the top ( sticks out over the water 26 floors up) was very good and the service again was beyond excellent , when a window table opened up the polite bus person offered to move our drinks and complimentary sweets and nuts to there no problem we just stood up and in a flash it was done. They are all just so eager to give the best service. The hotel is expensive but there are no hidden charges and freebies and services just make this a luxury stay that is worth every cent , so indulge yourself for a night or two and even try the sister resorts near by. We loved the hotel and loved Dubai in general , it is totally safe there and there is no crime period except the traffic is scary fast. We went in January during the shopping festival and if you like shopping that is the time to go. The only regrets we had were not going to Wild Wadi and not having enough luggage to take everything home. Anyone needing more details can email me. ","5","2004-01"
